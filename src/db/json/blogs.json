				"value": "<p>\r\n\tI've been informed that there is some misunderstanding about something which was transcribed from my \"Conversation with a disciple.\" I did not take any time to check and edit that transcription as I sometimes do with transcriptions. Hence, I decided to take the responsibility myself to clarify a point which may not be clear.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I said, \"The sin can apply to many people. It's not just those sins which are inflicted upon us.\", I was responding particularly to the person sitting before me who was admitting that her perspective was jaded. She was suggesting that she was hating the sinner as much as the sin and she went on to explain how she was suffering from their sin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was therefore specifically addressing the tendency to hate the sinner when the sin causes our own suffering. In other words, when it causes pain to ourselves (unless, of course, it's the pain which comes from genuine Vaisnava compassion for other's sufferings…. which was not the case in this case) we tend to lose our objectivity and hate the sinner and not just the sin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf our anger towards the sinner is based on pure Vaisnava compassion, then according to our Vaisnava siddhanta, it's justifiable to become angry with the sinner when the sinner willfully causes pain to other Vaisnavas. But that was not the case in this case either.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut even the Vaisnava anger mentioned above has to be closely looked at within one's own heart, much in the same way Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur has described in \"Amrita Vani\" in a quote I oftentimes speak from (cited at the end of this explanation):\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, I said, \"the sin can apply to many people\" simply to emphasize this point, that it's better to not hate the sinner based solely on sins committed only to ourselves, much in the same way as Dharma the bull did not hate the personality of Kali for breaking his legs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this regard, Srila Prabhupada explained the following point in his purport to SB 1.17.18:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Although the bull, or the personality of religion, and the cow, the personality of the earth, knew perfectly well that the personality of Kali was the direct cause of their sufferings, still, as devotees of the Lord, they knew well also that without the sanction of the Lord no one could inflict trouble upon them. According to the Padma Purana, our present trouble is due to the fructifying of seedling sins, but even those seedling sins also gradually fade away by execution of pure devotional service. Thus even if the devotees see the mischief-mongers, they do not accuse them for the sufferings inflicted. They take it for granted that the mischief-monger is made to act by some indirect cause, and therefore they tolerate the sufferings, thinking them to be God-given in small doses, for otherwise the sufferings should have been greater.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was on this basis that I said, \"The sin can apply to many people.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI realize that this may not fully address whatever questions arose on this topic, but at this point in time, it's the most I can offer given all of the other matters I'm currently dealing with.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI sincerely hope, however, that at least some of the confusion has been cleared by this explanation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI will not be able to go any further than this, neither now nor in the immediate future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's quote:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIs anger toward those envious of devotees a limb of devotional service?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe should display anger toward those who are envious of devotees. This is a particular limb of devotional service. A lack of anger against blasphemers is unjustified. But we need to understand who is actually envious of devotees. Those who do not serve the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul and most blissful friend of all living entities, do not benefit themselves but instead invite trouble by their envy of Kṛṣṇa and the Vaiṣṇavas. Such people are branded as envious, and we should not show them mercy. These people become intoxicated by worshiping materialists. We should both ignore them and display our anger toward them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut before that, we have to see whether we ourselves are envious of devotees, whether we ourselves are actually serving Kṛṣṇa. Or are we serving something else on the pretext of serving Kṛṣṇa? How much are we attached to Kṛṣṇa? Are we trying to enjoy the objects meant for Kṛṣṇa’s enjoyment?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI think my enjoyment-prone material body is fiercely envious of Kṛṣṇa and His devotees, because instead of thinking constantly of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet and happiness, I am busy worrying about my own happiness, blaspheming others, and looking for faults. I do not look at myself at all. I am such an offender at the feet of devotees that I should first learn to display anger toward myself. I am so envious of devotees that I should beat myself with shoes simply to purify myself. Then I can set an example for others and sincerely engage in the service of Hari, guru, and the Vaiṣṇavas. I must remember that everyone is worshiping Hari but me. I am unable to do so. I should also remember that I may die at any moment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo first we should show anger toward our own sinful propensities, such as our desire for profit, adoration, and distinction and our propensity to cheat others. We must correct ourselves first. Otherwise, we cannot correct others. Then we have to correct those who are related to us, who are envious of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa and who are pulling us toward material enjoyment by tempting us. This is the secret of success.\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI would like to discuss the same topic we discussed in our last conversation… about the devotees who are disturbing me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI don't remember all of the details of our conversation but I thought I said that if you accept them as they are, that the problem would go away. What I meant, I'm almost sure, is that if you just accept them as they are, it meant that you were accepting that however they dealt with you was for your own purification. If you see things in that way then you see Krishna's hand, that Krishna has arranged for you to be in this situation and this situation is meant for your own purification, and if you accept it in that way then you will no longer see them as problems anymore. I might have also given my own experience, that I oftentimes talk about, the time when my temple president was insulting me. Did I?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot completely. But I remember.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou remember the story? Because I was speaking to you based upon my own experience, that it was very difficult for me to tolerate the way I was being dealt with by this particular temple president. And you know the story how I was asked to give SB class, and I was speaking, with references of the Bhagavatam about Maharaja Rahugana. And then I was getting such wonderful realizations that I realized that I could have never possibly gotten these realizations if my president hadn't treated me that way. And I became grateful. And then when I thanked him, in my heart, for the way he treated me. I really changed. The problems went away. And he stopped treating me that way. So it was based on my own realization.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDid you have any bad feelings toward him?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNo.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOK. Our situation in asrama. Ekadasi Night. Kirtan on the roof. I cannot sleep. I cannot go on harinama. And I'm tired and I want to sleep but the kirtan is very loud… mrdanga kartals etc. I cannot rest. The next day I feel completely broken. I do not have any desire to do anything. And I feel that they must not do that. It's not correct. I know. Kirtan is OK but&nbsp; there is time and circumstances. I mean when devotional service of someone disturbs my own devotional service, what should I do?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat else can you do but tolerate?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course I had to tolerate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. Because you tried to get them to change and they don't. I remember you telling me that also. You appealed to them. You appealed to others, and nothing changed. What else can you do?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'm ready to tolerate, but I'm not ready to forgive them and to feel some good feelings towards them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, but then that means that your mind is disturbed by their presence. So keep you distance from them. Otherwise you're going to have to be disturbed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt's one building. No way to keep a distance. In our society we practically never speak about good manners, at least to be sensitive to other people.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe speak about this all of the time, but maybe they don't hear about it in your asrama, that's all. But I wouldn't say \"in our society\". That's a pretty broad generalization… in our society. Maybe in _________&nbsp; they don't speak about it in the women's asrama. But it is definitely talked about in many places. I certainly speak about it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou do. You always say that all of your good qualities are not your credit. But I can see that from the very beginning in your Krishna consciousness, you had many good qualities. And those qualities which you have now, you just developed your qualities which you had from the very beginning. Or you developed different qualities?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo tell you the truth, I don't remember a time when I deliberately decided to develop good qualities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt seems that you have good qualities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the point is that I don't remember a time when I deliberately decided, \"I'm going to develop this quality.\" It's just something that evolved through my own experiences of interacting with other people. And chanting Hare Krishna and praying to my spiritual master. But I can't remember a time when I was thinking, \"Well I have to think about developing.\"...I can remember thinking, \"I have to be tolerant.\" That I can remember. I had to learn tolerance a lot in the beginning. But it's something that I've had to learn for forty-five years. Tolerance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut when I see your example. For me it's a perfect example because you love people, and you do not discriminate against them and you do not see their faults. And you do not criticize them. I am an example of the opposite. And how can I learn this?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWell I always answer that question, when it's asked, not directly about me, but just in general, that if you want to develop the qualities that you see in others, the best way to develop their good qualities is by serving them. Consciously serving them, in the way I spoke about the other evening. I don't know if you were there? That's why I attribute that whatever good qualities others may see in me is only because I tried to consciously serve the person who was the embodient of all good qualities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat can I do for you? Because my service during my service during your visit is so insignificant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWell there are many other ways to serve me in the same way I have found in service to Srila Prabhupada. Telling others about Krishna is the way to serve me. Telling others about your own realizations in Krishna concsiousness is a way to serve me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBeing a good example. I oftentimes emphasize that the wrong act committed by the servant leads people in general to blame the master, and the opposite of that is that whatever good behavior there is in a disciple, always brings credit to the spiritual master. That's a way to serve me. And these are ways that disciples can serve in separation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I am not present there are ways that you can serve me. I mean that there are also ways my disciples serve me who don't see me. For instance, transcribing my lectures. Or helping with printing of my books, or distributing the books, and these are also different ways disciples serve me when they are not physically with me. But these opportunities are available to anyone who wants to do it. But as far as direct personal service? You can't get much more personal than those services which I just described.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese are the services that mean the most to me. [Not serving my body.] These are the things that I speak about all of the time. These are the things that I try to invest so much of my energy and time in trying to teach others that when I see somebody reciprocating with my efforts to help them in that way, it gives me life. It gives me a purpose for being here. I feel reciprocation that I'm actually doing something to share what Prabhupada gave me with others. It just gives me life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe all have to feel a sense of purpose. That gives us life. We then feel like, \"I have some purpose for being here. Some purpose for being on this planet. I have some purpose to be recognized by others. That's the best way to be recognized, by service. Serving in the ways I just described is a powerful way to be recognized. Because it's not only simply by the recognition, as I told in my story. Prabhupada never recognized [externally] the rooms that I prepared for him. But he did recognize. Nobody will tell me that he didn't. He did.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course he did because you had a big desire to satisfy him. And in this age of Kali very often Krishna punishes us because sometimes it's the only way to strengthen our intelligence. How can we strengthen our intelligence in another way without punishment?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout being punished?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou don't like being punished..? Prabhupada, I think you must have heard me say this many times, because I quote Prabhupada on this. Prabhupada said that to strengthen our intelligence means that before we do anything, we compare it to the instructions we received from guru and Krishna. And by building everything that we do on those higher instructions, our intelligence becomes stronger. Prabhupada even said that for the disciple, intelligence means… the instructions of the spiritual master. Therefore before we do anything we should be thinking, \"Is this what I should be doing?\" And compare it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the very beginning I had this feeling. I always before I do something, I always thought, what would you think about it. But then I lost this feeling. And I would like to restore it. And one time you spoke about sin and sinner, how to separate them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHate the sin and not the sinner, you mean?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. And I don't understand, because sin does not exist without sinner. How to separate that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe sin can apply to many people. It's not just those sins which are inflicted upon us. But it can be those sins which have been inflicted upon anybody. So you hate the sin. Even when it happens to others, and you see others who are suffering as a result of that sin, including the sinner. So that's how you distinguish. Usually we put them together seeing the sin is that which has caused \"me\" suffering. But no. We have to learn how to distinguish between the sin and the sinner. The sin, in of itself, is universal. We can see another person committing a sinful act and the object of their sinful act suffers. The person who commits the sin, we think, \"That person is going to suffer.\" So we can hate the sin. But the sinner we feel compassion for. Why should they suffer. And why should the person who will be the object of their sin suffer also? So let me help this person so that they don't have to suffer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI meant devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou meant devotees? Well. What's the sin? Devotees are supposed to be sinless.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen they behave unfair and disrespectfully. But they are quite satisfied and pleased with themselves. So I cannot think about how they will suffer, because it doesn't look like they will suffer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut it seems like you're the one who suffers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUh-huh. Yes. I do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause my parents, I was raised with the thought that we should take into consideration other people and we should not disturb them. And I don't do all of these things which they do. But they still do not like me. And they don't like that. And you may remember, that you said many years ago that if I do not learn how to associate with devotees I will never reach the spiritual world because Krishna is always surrounded by His devotees. So there is no hope.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy why does it have to be only those devotees. The ones who disturb you so much. Aren't there any other devotees who don't disturb you?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. There are.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo why don't you increase your association with them?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI do. But still I have to go to my place and I have to suffer. Because mostly I spend my time in my room. But I try to work on it, although not very successfully.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI can understand the difficulty. Familiarity breeds contempt. You have to live with that constantly. The same manner of dealings with you. They don't change. Your same attitude towards them. It doesn't change. And nothing changes. So usually under those circumstances when you are forced into a situation that can't be changed but you have no other choice but to accept it, it becomes more difficult to tolerate and that's the kind of living situation that you're in.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI can't sit down and talk to these people. Obviously you're not asking me to sit down and talk to these people, whoever they may be. And I'm grateful that you don't ask me to speak with them. I'm sure that you wouldn't even think of it. But what can I do? I don't even know who they are. And I don't even know if they have a potential to change. I don't even know if it's them. Or if it's something that you're doing that's provoking them to behave in that way. It doesn't sound to me like you are. From what you tell me, there's nothing you are doing to provoke them to deal with you in that way. It sounds to me that it's just a situation, or circumstance that you're all familiar with each others shortcomings and nobody is willing to make the changes required to make the relationships more harmonious. Everybody has reached their limit... including yourself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes I'm in despair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI can see that. I have no other way to try to help you except to help you internalize because I can't help you on the external platform.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. That's what I need from you. An internal change.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInternal changes can only come by learning how to accept the situation that Krishna has put you in and to see that it's Krishna's will. \"There is no other reason to explain why I'm here? Why I'm doing this?&nbsp; It's been sanctioned by Krishna and if it's been sanctioned by Krishna, and if it's His will, I have to learn to accept it. And if He wants a different situation for me, then He'll arrange it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe more you keep on hearing about Krishna and learning how Krishna is such a loving friend…. Krishna knows what's going on in our hearts. And Krishna will never do anything that's bad for us. And when we increase our hearing about Krishna, the more we see His presence in our life, and the more we become grateful. And then the more we become grateful, the more Krishna massages our hearts and we actually feel his presence more and more in our life, and we become peaceful. But it takes time for the whole process to take place. Somehow this place, this place, this ashram, these women, these circumstances, it's what you are being given right now as your test. And when you can actually accept it, it will become an opportunity for you to move on and then there will be more tests. But it's all because Krishna wants you, more than anything else, to come back to Him. He wants to make this your last visit to the material world. And he's going to make sure that every test that you get, He'll do His best to help you and give you the strength to overcome it so that you can remove all of these obstacles on your path, and go back to Godhead. You're so fortunate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not so quick.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt may not be so quick. It may even not happen in this life. But you have a very auspicious opportunity to make it in this life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf I do some devotional service in my room, for example, listen to a lecture, and another mataji does the same thing very loudly and I cannot hear the lecture which I'm listening to, but instead of this, I'm listening to the cacophony from the corridor, what should I do in this case. I don't know. I become very angry in this case. Because they don't understand. I want to do something.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is nobody who is responsible for this place where you stay. Is that what you're telling me?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo matajis… ________ and ___________.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut they don't listen to you?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey don't listen to me. So for them it's not a problem at all. If I complain to someone who is in charge, I mean above them is it correct or not?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo complain is not the best approach. The best approach is to not come forward with a complaint demanding that someone should do something about it. The best approach is to very humbly come forward and ask the person, \"Is this the right situation. I'll describe it. Do you have time for me to describe it? If you don't have time for me to describe it, can I write it down, and will you read it? And then just give me an answer? Is this the right situation that I should tolerate? Or maybe do you see that there's something that could be done to improve the situation because I've been living like this for so long and I've been trying to tolerate but it's been very difficult for me.\" That's the best way, rather than to complain. Because people don't like it when somebody comes just to complain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaybe it's not the right word?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'd say, \"making them aware.\" There's a difference between making somebody aware and complaining. A person who complains is usually somebody who wants somebody to do something about it. That's a complaint. \" I have a complaint. You do something about it. It's your resopnsibility.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI tried to do it one or two years ago.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo make somebody aware.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. Because they wanted to throw me out of the ashram. And there was some conversation between ______, ________, and _______&nbsp; who is above them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOh _________? He's the person who is above them?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe was at least one year ago.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t_________ is a very reasonable person.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. He is. When we talk with each other. Yes he is very reasonable. But when we talk together, he was on their side. Unfortunately very often I can see in our society that if you are an ordinary devotee and do not have any position, any title, then they will not listen to you. I don't want to think in such a way. But that's what I see.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI don't know what \"ordinary devotee\" means.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOrdinary devotee means not a Prabhupada disciple, not a scholarly brahmana, I don't know what. Sorry for this but that's what I think. One more question? How to realize that Krishna's name is not different from Krishna so that we would not ignore Him when we chant Hare Krishna?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo realize Krishna's name is nondifferent from Him, is not a mechanical process. It's not something that you can do and immediately see Krishna in His name. Like anything in spiritual life, Krishna always has the choice and final decision in how He will reveal Himself to every individual. He has the final decision. What works for one to achieve that decision may not be the exact same situation that works for another. But what works for everyone is love. And love is something very difficult. It's not so easy, it's not so cheap to have. To take lust which is \"for me\" and to completely turn it to love \"for Krishna\" requires a cleaning of the heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout ceto darpana marjanam, without a cleaning of the heart, you will not be able to see Krishna in His name. So it begins with cleaning the heart, which you are doing. But you have to continue the cleaning process. And to continue the cleaning process means that whatever obstacle you are facing right now in your spiritual life, you need to be able to overcome it. And if you don't overcome it, it will hinder your progress in being able to experience Krishna in His name. He won't reveal. He only reveals Himself to those whose hearts are clean.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo what do we do? How to get a clean heart? We get clean hearts by approaching Krishna in His name, approaching Him through prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was speaking to somebody the other day and I was saying how powerful prayer is. That prayer is something that we have a tendency to minimize because it takes a lot of hard work to pray. Usually it's more comfortable for the mind to just kind of gravitate to the easier things to think about than to really go deep within our own hearts and to actually reveal something that Krishna already knows. But to reveal and speak to Him personally and saying, \"Krishna this is who I am, but I want to be \"this\" person, who is higher than I am. But I know that I can't be this person who's higher than I am without Your help.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo let me tell You all these things about who I am now, that's preventing me from becoming the higher person who I want to be. This is the type of person I want to be, but I'm telling all of these things because I can't come to that level of a \"higher person\" without Your help. And I'm suffering. Because I always see the person that I don't want to be, but I'm living with that person every day. And every day I'm living with the person I don't want to be, it causes me pain because I would really like to be the person who's higher.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut how do I get to that higher point unless You, Krishna, help me? Because I have no other way.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat's prayer. It takes work. It actually takes work. But that's what is required to become purified. It's work. And you're capable of doing it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tActually I never pray.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut you're capable of doing it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI hope so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou have my blessings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor praying? I repeat only one prayer from Ayurveda. It's not for the health. It's just very nice prayer. But I'm not sure that I can translate it into English. Maybe Prabhu can help?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe's putting together my Ayurvedic medicine for me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. I know. It sounds so nicely in Russian. I don't know how to translate it properly into English.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Dear Krishna, you are inside of me, within my very breath, within each bird, each mighty mountain. Your sweet touch reaches everything and I am well protected.<br />\r\n\tThank you Krishna for this beautiful day before me. May joy, love, peace and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day. I am healing and I am healed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat's your prayer?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMy only prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEnd of recording.\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"safe_value": "<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI would like to discuss the same topic we discussed in our last conversation… about the devotees who are disturbing me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI don't remember all of the details of our conversation but I thought I said that if you accept them as they are, that the problem would go away. What I meant, I'm almost sure, is that if you just accept them as they are, it meant that you were accepting that however they dealt with you was for your own purification. If you see things in that way then you see Krishna's hand, that Krishna has arranged for you to be in this situation and this situation is meant for your own purification, and if you accept it in that way then you will no longer see them as problems anymore. I might have also given my own experience, that I oftentimes talk about, the time when my temple president was insulting me. Did I?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNot completely. But I remember.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYou remember the story? Because I was speaking to you based upon my own experience, that it was very difficult for me to tolerate the way I was being dealt with by this particular temple president. And you know the story how I was asked to give SB class, and I was speaking, with references of the Bhagavatam about Maharaja Rahugana. And then I was getting such wonderful realizations that I realized that I could have never possibly gotten these realizations if my president hadn't treated me that way. And I became grateful. And then when I thanked him, in my heart, for the way he treated me. I really changed. The problems went away. And he stopped treating me that way. So it was based on my own realization.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDid you have any bad feelings toward him?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNo.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOK. Our situation in asrama. Ekadasi Night. Kirtan on the roof. I cannot sleep. I cannot go on harinama. And I'm tired and I want to sleep but the kirtan is very loud… mrdanga kartals etc. I cannot rest. The next day I feel completely broken. I do not have any desire to do anything. And I feel that they must not do that. It's not correct. I know. Kirtan is OK but  there is time and circumstances. I mean when devotional service of someone disturbs my own devotional service, what should I do?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat else can you do but tolerate?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course I had to tolerate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYes. Because you tried to get them to change and they don't. I remember you telling me that also. You appealed to them. You appealed to others, and nothing changed. What else can you do?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI'm ready to tolerate, but I'm not ready to forgive them and to feel some good feelings towards them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, but then that means that your mind is disturbed by their presence. So keep you distance from them. Otherwise you're going to have to be disturbed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's one building. No way to keep a distance. In our society we practically never speak about good manners, at least to be sensitive to other people.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe speak about this all of the time, but maybe they don't hear about it in your asrama, that's all. But I wouldn't say \"in our society\". That's a pretty broad generalization… in our society. Maybe in _________  they don't speak about it in the women's asrama. But it is definitely talked about in many places. I certainly speak about it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYou do. You always say that all of your good qualities are not your credit. But I can see that from the very beginning in your Krishna consciousness, you had many good qualities. And those qualities which you have now, you just developed your qualities which you had from the very beginning. Or you developed different qualities?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo tell you the truth, I don't remember a time when I deliberately decided to develop good qualities.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seems that you have good qualities.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the point is that I don't remember a time when I deliberately decided, \"I'm going to develop this quality.\" It's just something that evolved through my own experiences of interacting with other people. And chanting Hare Krishna and praying to my spiritual master. But I can't remember a time when I was thinking, \"Well I have to think about developing.\"...I can remember thinking, \"I have to be tolerant.\" That I can remember. I had to learn tolerance a lot in the beginning. But it's something that I've had to learn for forty-five years. Tolerance.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when I see your example. For me it's a perfect example because you love people, and you do not discriminate against them and you do not see their faults. And you do not criticize them. I am an example of the opposite. And how can I learn this?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWell I always answer that question, when it's asked, not directly about me, but just in general, that if you want to develop the qualities that you see in others, the best way to develop their good qualities is by serving them. Consciously serving them, in the way I spoke about the other evening. I don't know if you were there? That's why I attribute that whatever good qualities others may see in me is only because I tried to consciously serve the person who was the embodient of all good qualities.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat can I do for you? Because my service during my service during your visit is so insignificant.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWell there are many other ways to serve me in the same way I have found in service to Srila Prabhupada. Telling others about Krishna is the way to serve me. Telling others about your own realizations in Krishna concsiousness is a way to serve me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBeing a good example. I oftentimes emphasize that the wrong act committed by the servant leads people in general to blame the master, and the opposite of that is that whatever good behavior there is in a disciple, always brings credit to the spiritual master. That's a way to serve me. And these are ways that disciples can serve in separation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I am not present there are ways that you can serve me. I mean that there are also ways my disciples serve me who don't see me. For instance, transcribing my lectures. Or helping with printing of my books, or distributing the books, and these are also different ways disciples serve me when they are not physically with me. But these opportunities are available to anyone who wants to do it. But as far as direct personal service? You can't get much more personal than those services which I just described.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are the services that mean the most to me. [Not serving my body.] These are the things that I speak about all of the time. These are the things that I try to invest so much of my energy and time in trying to teach others that when I see somebody reciprocating with my efforts to help them in that way, it gives me life. It gives me a purpose for being here. I feel reciprocation that I'm actually doing something to share what Prabhupada gave me with others. It just gives me life.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe all have to feel a sense of purpose. That gives us life. We then feel like, \"I have some purpose for being here. Some purpose for being on this planet. I have some purpose to be recognized by others. That's the best way to be recognized, by service. Serving in the ways I just described is a powerful way to be recognized. Because it's not only simply by the recognition, as I told in my story. Prabhupada never recognized [externally] the rooms that I prepared for him. But he did recognize. Nobody will tell me that he didn't. He did.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course he did because you had a big desire to satisfy him. And in this age of Kali very often Krishna punishes us because sometimes it's the only way to strengthen our intelligence. How can we strengthen our intelligence in another way without punishment?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWithout being punished?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYou don't like being punished..? Prabhupada, I think you must have heard me say this many times, because I quote Prabhupada on this. Prabhupada said that to strengthen our intelligence means that before we do anything, we compare it to the instructions we received from guru and Krishna. And by building everything that we do on those higher instructions, our intelligence becomes stronger. Prabhupada even said that for the disciple, intelligence means… the instructions of the spiritual master. Therefore before we do anything we should be thinking, \"Is this what I should be doing?\" And compare it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the very beginning I had this feeling. I always before I do something, I always thought, what would you think about it. But then I lost this feeling. And I would like to restore it. And one time you spoke about sin and sinner, how to separate them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHate the sin and not the sinner, you mean?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYes. And I don't understand, because sin does not exist without sinner. How to separate that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe sin can apply to many people. It's not just those sins which are inflicted upon us. But it can be those sins which have been inflicted upon anybody. So you hate the sin. Even when it happens to others, and you see others who are suffering as a result of that sin, including the sinner. So that's how you distinguish. Usually we put them together seeing the sin is that which has caused \"me\" suffering. But no. We have to learn how to distinguish between the sin and the sinner. The sin, in of itself, is universal. We can see another person committing a sinful act and the object of their sinful act suffers. The person who commits the sin, we think, \"That person is going to suffer.\" So we can hate the sin. But the sinner we feel compassion for. Why should they suffer. And why should the person who will be the object of their sin suffer also? So let me help this person so that they don't have to suffer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI meant devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYou meant devotees? Well. What's the sin? Devotees are supposed to be sinless.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen they behave unfair and disrespectfully. But they are quite satisfied and pleased with themselves. So I cannot think about how they will suffer, because it doesn't look like they will suffer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it seems like you're the one who suffers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUh-huh. Yes. I do.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause my parents, I was raised with the thought that we should take into consideration other people and we should not disturb them. And I don't do all of these things which they do. But they still do not like me. And they don't like that. And you may remember, that you said many years ago that if I do not learn how to associate with devotees I will never reach the spiritual world because Krishna is always surrounded by His devotees. So there is no hope.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBy why does it have to be only those devotees. The ones who disturb you so much. Aren't there any other devotees who don't disturb you?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYes. There are.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo why don't you increase your association with them?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI do. But still I have to go to my place and I have to suffer. Because mostly I spend my time in my room. But I try to work on it, although not very successfully.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI can understand the difficulty. Familiarity breeds contempt. You have to live with that constantly. The same manner of dealings with you. They don't change. Your same attitude towards them. It doesn't change. And nothing changes. So usually under those circumstances when you are forced into a situation that can't be changed but you have no other choice but to accept it, it becomes more difficult to tolerate and that's the kind of living situation that you're in.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI can't sit down and talk to these people. Obviously you're not asking me to sit down and talk to these people, whoever they may be. And I'm grateful that you don't ask me to speak with them. I'm sure that you wouldn't even think of it. But what can I do? I don't even know who they are. And I don't even know if they have a potential to change. I don't even know if it's them. Or if it's something that you're doing that's provoking them to behave in that way. It doesn't sound to me like you are. From what you tell me, there's nothing you are doing to provoke them to deal with you in that way. It sounds to me that it's just a situation, or circumstance that you're all familiar with each others shortcomings and nobody is willing to make the changes required to make the relationships more harmonious. Everybody has reached their limit... including yourself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes I'm in despair.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI can see that. I have no other way to try to help you except to help you internalize because I can't help you on the external platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYes. That's what I need from you. An internal change.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tInternal changes can only come by learning how to accept the situation that Krishna has put you in and to see that it's Krishna's will. \"There is no other reason to explain why I'm here? Why I'm doing this?  It's been sanctioned by Krishna and if it's been sanctioned by Krishna, and if it's His will, I have to learn to accept it. And if He wants a different situation for me, then He'll arrange it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe more you keep on hearing about Krishna and learning how Krishna is such a loving friend…. Krishna knows what's going on in our hearts. And Krishna will never do anything that's bad for us. And when we increase our hearing about Krishna, the more we see His presence in our life, and the more we become grateful. And then the more we become grateful, the more Krishna massages our hearts and we actually feel his presence more and more in our life, and we become peaceful. But it takes time for the whole process to take place. Somehow this place, this place, this ashram, these women, these circumstances, it's what you are being given right now as your test. And when you can actually accept it, it will become an opportunity for you to move on and then there will be more tests. But it's all because Krishna wants you, more than anything else, to come back to Him. He wants to make this your last visit to the material world. And he's going to make sure that every test that you get, He'll do His best to help you and give you the strength to overcome it so that you can remove all of these obstacles on your path, and go back to Godhead. You're so fortunate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's not so quick.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt may not be so quick. It may even not happen in this life. But you have a very auspicious opportunity to make it in this life.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf I do some devotional service in my room, for example, listen to a lecture, and another mataji does the same thing very loudly and I cannot hear the lecture which I'm listening to, but instead of this, I'm listening to the cacophony from the corridor, what should I do in this case. I don't know. I become very angry in this case. Because they don't understand. I want to do something.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is nobody who is responsible for this place where you stay. Is that what you're telling me?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo matajis… ________ and ___________.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut they don't listen to you?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThey don't listen to me. So for them it's not a problem at all. If I complain to someone who is in charge, I mean above them is it correct or not?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo complain is not the best approach. The best approach is to not come forward with a complaint demanding that someone should do something about it. The best approach is to very humbly come forward and ask the person, \"Is this the right situation. I'll describe it. Do you have time for me to describe it? If you don't have time for me to describe it, can I write it down, and will you read it? And then just give me an answer? Is this the right situation that I should tolerate? Or maybe do you see that there's something that could be done to improve the situation because I've been living like this for so long and I've been trying to tolerate but it's been very difficult for me.\" That's the best way, rather than to complain. Because people don't like it when somebody comes just to complain.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMaybe it's not the right word?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI'd say, \"making them aware.\" There's a difference between making somebody aware and complaining. A person who complains is usually somebody who wants somebody to do something about it. That's a complaint. \" I have a complaint. You do something about it. It's your resopnsibility.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI tried to do it one or two years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo make somebody aware.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYes. Because they wanted to throw me out of the ashram. And there was some conversation between ______, ________, and _______  who is above them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOh _________? He's the person who is above them?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe was at least one year ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t_________ is a very reasonable person.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYes. He is. When we talk with each other. Yes he is very reasonable. But when we talk together, he was on their side. Unfortunately very often I can see in our society that if you are an ordinary devotee and do not have any position, any title, then they will not listen to you. I don't want to think in such a way. But that's what I see.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI don't know what \"ordinary devotee\" means.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOrdinary devotee means not a Prabhupada disciple, not a scholarly brahmana, I don't know what. Sorry for this but that's what I think. One more question? How to realize that Krishna's name is not different from Krishna so that we would not ignore Him when we chant Hare Krishna?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo realize Krishna's name is nondifferent from Him, is not a mechanical process. It's not something that you can do and immediately see Krishna in His name. Like anything in spiritual life, Krishna always has the choice and final decision in how He will reveal Himself to every individual. He has the final decision. What works for one to achieve that decision may not be the exact same situation that works for another. But what works for everyone is love. And love is something very difficult. It's not so easy, it's not so cheap to have. To take lust which is \"for me\" and to completely turn it to love \"for Krishna\" requires a cleaning of the heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWithout ceto darpana marjanam, without a cleaning of the heart, you will not be able to see Krishna in His name. So it begins with cleaning the heart, which you are doing. But you have to continue the cleaning process. And to continue the cleaning process means that whatever obstacle you are facing right now in your spiritual life, you need to be able to overcome it. And if you don't overcome it, it will hinder your progress in being able to experience Krishna in His name. He won't reveal. He only reveals Himself to those whose hearts are clean.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what do we do? How to get a clean heart? We get clean hearts by approaching Krishna in His name, approaching Him through prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was speaking to somebody the other day and I was saying how powerful prayer is. That prayer is something that we have a tendency to minimize because it takes a lot of hard work to pray. Usually it's more comfortable for the mind to just kind of gravitate to the easier things to think about than to really go deep within our own hearts and to actually reveal something that Krishna already knows. But to reveal and speak to Him personally and saying, \"Krishna this is who I am, but I want to be \"this\" person, who is higher than I am. But I know that I can't be this person who's higher than I am without Your help.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let me tell You all these things about who I am now, that's preventing me from becoming the higher person who I want to be. This is the type of person I want to be, but I'm telling all of these things because I can't come to that level of a \"higher person\" without Your help. And I'm suffering. Because I always see the person that I don't want to be, but I'm living with that person every day. And every day I'm living with the person I don't want to be, it causes me pain because I would really like to be the person who's higher.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut how do I get to that higher point unless You, Krishna, help me? Because I have no other way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat's prayer. It takes work. It actually takes work. But that's what is required to become purified. It's work. And you're capable of doing it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tActually I never pray.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut you're capable of doing it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI hope so.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYou have my blessings.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor praying? I repeat only one prayer from Ayurveda. It's not for the health. It's just very nice prayer. But I'm not sure that I can translate it into English. Maybe Prabhu can help?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe's putting together my Ayurvedic medicine for me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYes. I know. It sounds so nicely in Russian. I don't know how to translate it properly into English.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Dear Krishna, you are inside of me, within my very breath, within each bird, each mighty mountain. Your sweet touch reaches everything and I am well protected.<br />\n\tThank you Krishna for this beautiful day before me. May joy, love, peace and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day. I am healing and I am healed.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat's your prayer?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDisciple:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMy only prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEnd of recording.\n</p>\n",

One must disclose his mind and take instruction. One must give him to eat, and one must take something from him to eat. These are the six symptoms of love. Give and take. Just like you have given me this flower, so you have given. So if I instructed, “You take it,” that is give and take. If I offer you prasadam, you should bring some foodstuff. You should disclose your mind, and you should say that “This is my problem; you should hear me.” This is a symptom of love.

What is material benefit out of it? I am old man. I cannot move. I am eighty years, and two years less. Naturally this is not the age for traveling, retirement. But why I am traveling? Because I wanted to satisfy my Guru Maharaja. That is the only reason. I wanted to satisfy the desire of my Guru Maharaja, the desire of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. And therefore at night I don’t sleep; I dictate. I publish this book. I go from country to country, village to village, town to town. And they also reciprocate, these boys. They’re helping me, how to publish these book, these boys. That boy is editing twenty-four hours; he is typing. Do I pay them anything?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t… This is love. “I go away from Guru Maharaja and live four hundred miles away, and I love Guru Maharaja.” … Nonsense. You show some symptoms of love, that “My Guru Maharaja wants to do this. Oh, I must help him.” Just like Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted, prithivite achhe yata nagaradi gram: “As many towns and villages are there, everywhere must there be…broadcasting My missionary activities.” ... … Just like a Christian, if he is real Christian, if he is actually following Lord Jesus Christ, Christ says, “Thou shalt not kill.” He must propagate, “You shall not kill.” But where is that Christian who is propagating? They are killing…\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t… It is clearly said in the first commandment, “Thou shalt not kill.” So every Christian, they must preach this cult. That is Christian. And he’s helping killing, and he’s a Christian? Similarly, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mission is prithivite achhe yata nagaradi gram: “As many towns and villages are there, you must preach this cult.” That is really devotee, one who is doing this. He may not be very successful preacher; that doesn’t matter. Because he is doing that, he is first-class devotee.…that is real love. That is real follower. What his predecessor has ordered, that must be done. At any risk. It doesn’t matter whether it is being nicely done or not nicely done—because he is attempting to do that, that is sufficient. That very attempt will make him successful. This is the principle. You see?... Vyavasayatmika buddhih. Unfortunately, you do not read.

Let me try it.” And with resolute purpose, I tried it. And therefore, I do not know, but people say that I have done very wonderful. People say that. … But what is the secret of this success? That resolution, that “My Guru Maharaja wanted this. I shall try my best to do this,” that’s all. I have no other secrets.

All glories to Your Divine Grace.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tToday I am observing your appearance day for the forth-fifth time. After standing before you like this annually for forty-five years, offering homage to your divine lotus feet, I'm thinking that I need to take a serious look within my heart and pray that my attempt to glorify you will some day become worthy of your attention.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWhen you were with us, you once told us:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\"So my Guru Maharaja used to say that 'Instead of seeing Krsna, you serve so faithfully that Krsna will see you.' That should be the process. Krsna is omnipresent. He can see you; He can understand you, what are doing. So we have to execute devotional service in such a faithful way that Krsna will see us. Then you will be successful. 'Don't try to see Krsna. Try to become seen by Krsna.' That was my Guru Maharaja's instruction.\"<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tHow can I ever expect Krsna to look at me unless you ask Him to look favorably upon me? My only hope is for capturing your merciful glance along with your benevolent smile of approval. I live for that. Without hope for it some day, there is no value to my life.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tKrsna remains passive with me as upadrasta and anumanta, the overseer and permitter.

All glories to Your Divine Grace.<br />\n\t <br />\n\tToday I am observing your appearance day for the forth-fifth time. After standing before you like this annually for forty-five years, offering homage to your divine lotus feet, I'm thinking that I need to take a serious look within my heart and pray that my attempt to glorify you will some day become worthy of your attention.<br />\n\t <br />\n\tWhen you were with us, you once told us:<br />\n\t <br />\n\t\"So my Guru Maharaja used to say that 'Instead of seeing Krsna, you serve so faithfully that Krsna will see you.' That should be the process. Krsna is omnipresent. He can see you; He can understand you, what are doing. So we have to execute devotional service in such a faithful way that Krsna will see us. Then you will be successful. 'Don't try to see Krsna. Try to become seen by Krsna.' That was my Guru Maharaja's instruction.\"<br />\n\t <br />\n\tHow can I ever expect Krsna to look at me unless you ask Him to look favorably upon me? My only hope is for capturing your merciful glance along with your benevolent smile of approval. I live for that. Without hope for it some day, there is no value to my life.<br />\n\t <br />\n\tKrsna remains passive with me as upadrasta and anumanta, the overseer and permitter. There is no reason for me to think that other than through your mercy, He will respond to me in any way other than that. I have no love for Him. I cannot therefore invoke His divine intervention.

In other words, the Lord doesn’t play favorites. As He says in the Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo ‘ham sarva-bhutesu, “I am equal to everyone.” So while the Lord reciprocates with all souls, it is natural that those who love Him intensely receive His special attention, for they want Him and nothing else.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere, in these three verses, we are getting an opportunity to hear a wonderful expression of deep attachment within the heart of Queen Kunti. As we know from her prayers in the First Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, when Krsna appeared before her, she was remembering many troubles she and her sons endured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe prayed, “My dear Krsna, Your Lordship has protected us from a poisoned cake, from a great fire, from cannibals, from the vicious assembly, from sufferings during our exile in the forest and from the battle where great generals fought. And now You have saved us from the weapon of Asvatthama. (SB 1.8.24)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd in the next well-known verse she says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tvipadah santu tah sasvat<br />\r\n\ttatra tatra jagad-guro<br />\r\n\tbhavato darsanam yat syad<br />\r\n\tapunar bhava-darsanam (SB 1.8.25)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“I wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that we could see You again and again, for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we reflect on this verse, we can become bewildered as to how such a prayer can be made. When comparing it to our own lives, are we&nbsp; prepared to ask for calamities as severe as those which were endured by Kunti and Pandavas? Are we prepared to take shelter under every circumstance as they always did being confident of the Lord’s constant protection?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe protection described here is, “We remembered you and understood that you were thinking of us.” Just that thought in itself, for Kunti, was a great solace to know that the Lord was thinking of her and her sons.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore in the next verse she says, “Our welfare was assured only when You remembered us, Your relatives, and gave us Your protection by sending my brother to visit us.” She is referring here to Akrura. Here in this verse she is saying, “You are the well-wishing friend and the Supreme Soul of the universe and there is never any illusion of ‘us’ and ‘them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, she is explaining that it appears that He is showing some partiality, because, “You are the well-wishing friend of everyone but even though You are residing in everyone’s heart and You are the well-wisher of all living beings, You are giving special attention to those who always remember You.” And she is feeling that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Krsna says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsamo 'ham sarva-bhutesu<br />\r\n\tna me dvesyo 'sti na priyah<br />\r\n\tye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya<br />\r\n\tmayi te tesu capy aham (Bg 9.29) (15:43:42)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“I am not envious of anyone. I am equal to all, but whoever renders service to Me is a friend to Me and I am a friend to them.” Being situated in the heart of all living beings, the Lord is equal to everyone and reciprocates according to the mood of their worship.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn connection to this verse, Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives an analogy of a wish-fulfilling desire tree. He explains that a wish-fulfilling desire tree will give fruit according to the mood of those who take shelter of it. Whatever fruit one wishes from this tree, the wish-fulfilling desire tree reciprocates accordingly. It’s equally disposed to fulfill the desires of everyone who takes shelter of that tree. But obviously those who don’t take shelter of it don’t get any result.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the same way the Supreme Personality of Godhead also differentiates between those who take shelter of Him and those who don’t take shelter of Him. He gives different results accordingly, just like the desire-tree.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that the speciality of the Lord in comparison to wish-fulfilling desire tree is that the desire tree will not become subordinate to those who worship it, whereas the Supreme Lord will become subordinate to His devotees or to those who possess bhakti. Therefore, the qualities we may see in the Supreme Lord – that He sometimes displays – such as friendship, hatred or indifference, are simply due to the relationship with bhakti, because it’s bhakti that controls the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tna sadhayati mam yogo<br />\r\n\tna sankhyam dharma uddhava<br />\r\n\tna svadhyayas tapas tyago<br />\r\n\tyatha bhaktir mamorjita (SB 11.14.20)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna tells Uddhava, “Unalloyed devotional service rendered to Me by My devotee brings Me under the control of the devotee.” That’s His speciality. That’s the difference between the Lord and the desire tree. The desire tree will give certain results according to the mood of the worshipper. Those who don’t take shelter get a different result. The Lord does the same thing. He is impartial, He maintains His impartiality. But for the devotee, as herein explained, while the Lord reciprocates with all souls, it is natural that those who love Him intensely receive His special attention because they want Him and nothing else.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the unique characteristic of a devotee. When his heart is filled with bhakti, then the Lord feels bound to reciprocate. This is the well-known quality described as bhakta-vatsalya.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also explains elsewhere that one should never think that this bhakta-vatsalya is mundane partiality. It appears like the Lord is playing favorites, but actually this quality is an ornament of the Lord. The word given is bhusana. It’s the one quality of the Supreme Lord which reconciles any apparent contradictions one may perceive His behavior. All&nbsp; contradictions can be reconciled by this one quality. Krsna will always be consistent in this regard. This reciprocal love which manifests because of the devotee's exclusive dependence, is natural. How can the Lord not reciprocate? He is equal to everyone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you exclusively depend on the Lord, then naturally the Lord will think, “This devotee who is depending on Me exclusively, how can I neglect him? How can I not reciprocate? How can I not give him My attention? How can I not remember him? He is always remembering Me. How can I not remember him?” It’s natural. It’s reciprocal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the Lord thinks this way about His devotees by always remembering them, He displays this quality, this characteristic which is so much relished and appreciated by His devotees – how the Lord is so merciful, so kind –&nbsp; that He can never forget anyone who renders service to Him. He never forgets even the small amount of service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis point was is made clear with Durvasa Muni, to whom the Lord appeared to be indifferent. You then may say, “If He is equal to everyone, then how can He be indifferent to Durvasa Muni?” Because bhakti was present within Ambarisa Maharaja. Due to Ambarisa Maharaja's bhakti the Lord appeared to manifest indifference when Durvasa Muni appealed to the Lord and the Lord then responded with the well-known verse, “I am completely under the control of My devotee. I am never, not for a moment, independent from My devotee. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat was Durvasa Muni asking? He was appealing, “Look! I’ve gone to Brahma, I’ve gone to Siva. I’ve been chased by Sudarsana cakra. They were incapable of helping. They could not give me any shelter. They told me it was beyond their ability to do anything. But I know it’s not beyond Your ability to do something. You are the person who invoked this cakra, so now I’ve come before You and I am taking shelter of You. Please protect me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura elaborates on this well-known conversation between Durvasa Muni and the Lord:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“I’ve come to You for shelter. Please think about my situation and manifest Your heart for someone who has come to You for shelter.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the Lord is indifferent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Sorry. I can’t do anything to help you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“What do you mean You can’t do anything to help me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord then describes how the bhakti in the heart of Maharaja Ambarisa was controlling Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“The devotee is always in My heart and I am always in the heart of My devotee. The devotee doesn’t think of anyone but Me, and I never think of anyone but him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord then further explains,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Maharaja Ambarisa takes Me into the core of his heart and he serves Me so very nicely there. And because he serves Me so nicely within his heart, naturally I want to reciprocate. Therefore I ask My devotee, ‘Please let me give you something.'”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat’s natural. The Lord wants to give something in return. But when He tries to offer something to His devotee, His devotee says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“I am not interested in that. I don’t want wealth. I don’t want fame. I don’t want power.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord says, “What can I offer you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“I don’t want anything. Just let me remember You.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe see so many prayers in the Bhagavatam when the devotees, in the Lord's presence, are asked,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“What can I give you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd the devotees say, “Please let me remember You. Please let me be counted as one of Your devotees. Wherever I may go, whatever birth I may take, please recognize me as Your devotee.”... as spoken by Lord Brahma.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOr His devotees may say, “Wherever I may take my birth please let me take birth in the association of Your devotees so that I can always remember You by hearing Your glories in their association.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe devotee doesn't ask for anything other than to serve Him in constant remembrance of Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust like the well-known response Prahlada Maharaja gave when Lord Nrsimhadeva asked Prahlada, “Please let Me give you a benediction.” Prahlada said to the Lord, “I am not a merchant. Don’t forget I was born in a family of demons. Don’t tempt me like this. I am not engaged in Your service for something in return. Just be my master and let me be Your servant birth after birth and then I will be happy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat is a devotee. A devotee simply wants the opportunity to remember and serve the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tContinuing with Visvanath Cakravarti Thakura's explanation... Durvasa Muni was pleading,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Please I am taking shelter of You. To whom else can I go for protection? Consider my situation and protect me. Please have a heart.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord responded, “No, sorry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“What do you mean?” asks Durvasa.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“My devotee is so dear to Me. I ask him again and again 'Please let Me give you something' but he does not want Me to give him anything. Because of his deep love for Me, he never wants anything else. So I had to give him something you're asking from Me personally but I don’t have it available right now. You are asking Me to have a heart. Sorry. Not there. You are asking Me to think of you. Sorry, I don’t even have My mind, because My thoughts are always with My devotee. He is always thinking of Me and I am always thinking of him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough My devotee doesn’t want anything I still want to give him something. Therefore, I give him the most valuable treasure I have in My treasure house. What could I give him that he will consider of value? I gave him My heart. So now you're asking for My heart, but I am telling you it’s not there.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis perfect example shows how bhakti controls the Lord. The Lord’s apparent indifference towards Durvasa has nothing to do with Durvasa Muni. It's connected with Maharaja Ambarisa’s bhakti.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, wherever the Lord also displays either friendship or hatred…\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust like the Lord told Duryodhana, “Because you are envious of the Pandavas, because you are their enemy, therefore you are My enemy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuryodhana invited the Lord to his home but the Lord was not willing to accept his invitation. He said,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“No. You are the enemy of the Pandavas. They are fully dependent on Me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis apparent enmity toward Duryodhana was not directly with Duryodhana, but it was due to the presence of bhakti in the hearts of the Pandavas. He is controlled by their bhakti. Although He is equal to everyone, the speciality of the Lord’s quality which is different from the desire tree is that the Lord becomes subordinate to his devotee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore whatever may appear to be like friendship… Krsna says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Whoever renders service to Me is a friend to Me and I am a friend to them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs explained here, He is not compromising His position as the well-wishing soul of the universe. In other words, the Lord is not playing favorites. He is not absorbed in this mentality or as the verse itself says, “For you the well-wishing friend, the soul of the universe there is never illusion of ‘us’ and ‘them.’”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat mentality comes into the mind of a person who thinks, “Because you are my friend I am your friend. If you are not my friend, you have enmity towards me, then I am not your friend.&nbsp; My friend is on my side, so we are together.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the Lord does not think “us” and “them” in relationship to Himself. There’s no enemy for the Lord. Nobody is successful in being an enemy of the Lord. Neither does the Lord deal with anyone as His enemy, because whatever the Lord does is always for the ultimate benefit even of one who is apparently His enemy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the Lord kills demons, they get liberation. Whatever the Lord does is always for the benefit of the recipient. He is not like a politician who needs to stay in his position because he is getting support from his friends and if you are not supporting him you are his enemies. The Lord doesn’t need votes to stay in his position as the Supreme Lord. He is the Lord and it doesn’t make any difference for Him if anyone votes for Him or not. He still is the Supreme Lord. That is His position.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord explains in the Twelfth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita that “...for those who are always meditating on Me, I become the swift deliverer of repeated birth and death.” He delivers them, frees them from all distresses.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere’s a verse in the Third Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tmad-asrayah katha mrstah<br />\r\n\tsrnvanti kathayanti ca<br />\r\n\ttapanti vividhas tapa<br />\r\n\tnaitan mad-gata-cetasah (SB 3.25.23)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Kapiladeva says to Devahuti, “Engaged constantly in chanting and hearing about Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sadhus do not suffer from material miseries because they are always filled with thoughts of My pastimes and activities.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA devotee, in all circumstances naturally -- spontaneously-- remembers the Lord. We were just speaking from a verse from Bhagavatam in Mayapur the other day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“As one mistakenly considers a flower garland to be a snake or experiences happiness and distress in a dream, so, in the material world, by a lack of careful consideration, we differentiate between happiness and distress, considering one good and the other bad.” (6.17.30)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis verse comes just after the well-known verse spoken by Lord Siva.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tParvati was astonished. She couldn’t understand. “How is it that I just gave a curse to Citraketu Maharaja to take birth as a demon, Citraketu Maharaja understood fully what that curse meant – He would take birth as a demon – but he has no fear. He is ready fully accept that curse.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCitraketu came down from his plane before Siva and Parvati and was completely equipoised.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“I’ll accept whatever your will is.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Siva explained that that is the nature of bhakti. That is a devotee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnarayana-parah sarve<br />\r\n\tna kutascana bibhyati<br />\r\n\tsvargapavarga-narakesv<br />\r\n\tapi tulyartha-darsinah (SB 6.17.28)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayaṇa, never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA devotee doesn’t fear any condition of life, whether he is in heaven or hell, whether he is liberated. For him it’s all the same. Why? Because for a devotee whether he is in heaven, in hell or liberated, he is interested in one thing only – service. That is all. One of the most favorable ways to render service to the Lord is to constantly remember Him under all circumstances.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the verses just after, Lord Siva begins to describe the nature of the duality of the material world. When speaking from that verse, we quoted Lord Caitanya:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tdvaite' bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba -- ‘manodharma'<br />\r\n\t'ei bhala, ei manda', -- ei saba ‘bhrama' (CC Antya 4.176)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“In the material world to say ‘this is good’ and ‘this is bad’ is a mental speculation.” Therefore to say “this is good” and “this is bad” is all a mistake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnder the influence of duality in this material world we tend to think “this is good” and “this is bad” in terms “this is pleasing, it makes me happy,” “this is bad – it causes my suffering.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada explains in that commentary that in the material world, there is duality consciousness. But there’s no such thing as good or bad. It’s all a mistake. It has nothing to do with the transcendental platform. Those who are in the transcendental consciousness see that even miseries of the material world as happiness, and material happiness as misery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen Prabhupada quotes the verse,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate<br />\r\n\tdurdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate<br />\r\n\tvisvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate<br />\r\n\tyat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah (Caitanya-candramrta 5)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"For a devotee who has received Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's merciful glance, kaivalya, merging into the existence of Brahman, appears hellish, the heavenly planets appear like phantasmagoria, the senses appear like serpents with broken teeth, the entire world becomes a replica of Vaikuntha, and the position of demigods headed by Lord Brahma and Lord Indra is considered equal to that of a tiny insect.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada's purport to the verse we spoke on in Mayapura was all about dreams, how in the material world there are bad dreams and good dreams. We think, “This is a bad dream” or, “This is a good dream,” but the happiness and distress we experience are only in relationship to dreams.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe gave an example from the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam that was given by the sage Kavi, one of the nine Yogendras, in his conversation with Maharaja Nimi. When Maharaja Nimi was asking about the nature of devotional service and how to become freed from fear, the sage Kavi explained that fear arises due to being absorbed in the material consciousness and bodily concept of life, thinking that one is a material body, and therefore by forgetting Krsna one forgets that he is the eternal servant of Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the next verse he says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Although the duality of the material world does not ultimately exist, the conditioned soul experiences it as real under the influence of his own conditioned intelligence. This imaginary experience of a world separate from Krsna can be compared to the acts of dreaming and desiring. When the conditioned soul dreams at night of something desirable or horrible, or when he daydreams of what he would like to have or avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his own imagination.” (SB 11.2.38)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe uses this analogy in relationship to dreams. Everyone can relate to dreaming because most people have dreams. Prabhupada even uses an analogy to help us understand the importance of analogies. He says that if you want to see the moon moving in the sky at night, you can stare at the moon, but it’s very difficult to see how it is moving by this way. But if you look at the moon through the branches of a tree, because the branches are closer, you can see from this branch to that branch how the moon is moving. Similarly we need analogies, something closer to us, within our realm of experience, to help us understand something that may seem too theoretical.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf we have a dream, a very good dream. Has anyone had a good dream before?&nbsp; [Mostly everyone raises their hand]. Has anyone had a bad dream before? [Mostly everyone raises their hand once again]. Ok you can relate to this then.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen you have a good dream and you are enjoying it, because usually a good dream means that it's enjoyable,&nbsp; then all of a sudden something happens and you wake up, you are sad,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“It was a dream. I thought it was so real. But it was a dream.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo you feel very sad. But when you have a bad dream... for instance, you're being eaten by a tiger.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor example, I have this experience a lot, because I fly a lot. While I'm on a plane, I may fall asleep and I start dreaming that the plane is falling very fast (laughter) and I wake up and I am happy (more laughter). “It was only a dream!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKavi explains that the happiness we feel in relationship to a bad dream and distress we feel in relationship to a good dream are not connected to reality, they are only connected to a dream. There is no connection to reality at all. So that’s the night dream.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen there is the daydream. The daydream is no different than the night dream. In the daydream we dream of something we would like to have and we feel happy. “Yes, I feel good. I'd really like to have that.” But because it’s not connected to reality and because we are trying to enjoy something separate from Krsna, when we get the fulfillment of our so-called daydream, it generally does not quite fit the bill. It didn’t bring us all the happiness we expected especially when we lose it or we see the other problems we didn't anticipate, that come with it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat’s the daydream – things that we would like to have. Then there are things we would like to avoid. For instance, everybody tries to avoid death, disease, suffering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes people even think that they are happy if they are not suffering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“How are you, Prabhu?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Things aren't that bad. I guess I must be happy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut there's much more to happiness than not suffering. We think of happiness and distress in relationship to the daydream, but there's really no difference between that and the happiness and distress in relationship to the night dream.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada quoted in the commentary to that Sixth Canto verse, “visvam purna-sukhayate”... for a devotee, for one who gets that merciful glance of Lord Caitanya, the whole universe becomes ecstatic. The devotee can be happy even when he's experiencing so-called distress.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter class one devotee came up to me and asked, “Maharaja, how can we be happy in distress?” I tried to explain to him about example we just gave about Queen Kunti and then I tried to explain the verse:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttat te 'nukampam su-samiksamano<br />\r\n\tbhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam<br />\r\n\thrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te<br />\r\n\tjiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak (SB 10.14.8)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t...how a devotee tolerates all the distresses of his life because it gives him the opportunity to remember the Lord. What is the spontaneous nature of a devotee? What is the test of a devotee? The test of a devotee is that in the face of adversity, a devotee does not ask the Lord to counteract his difficulty.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimilarly, Ambarisa Maharaja didn’t ask to counteract the difficulty he was put in. He just very naturally remembered the Lord. That's what was most natural for him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada explains in one purport in the chapter about Maharaja Ambarisa that Maharaja Ambarisa simply did what was natural for him. He didn’t say to the Lord, “Protect me.” He just naturally remembered the Lord and felt completely protected. And because he was completely dependent on the Lord, the Lord felt compelled to arrange to protect him, even though Ambarisa Maharaja was not asking for it. The devotee feels sheltered, even in the face of adversity, by remembering the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tmad-asrayah katha mrstah<br />\r\n\tsrnvanti kathayanti ca<br />\r\n\ttapanti vividhas tapa<br />\r\n\tnaitan mad-gata-cetasah (SB 3.25.23)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Engaged constantly in chanting and hearing about Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sadhus do not suffer from material miseries because they are always filled with thoughts of My pastimes and activities.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the next verse Lord Kapiladeva says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi<br />\r\n\tsarva-sanga-vivarjitah<br />\r\n\tsangas tesv atha te prarthyah<br />\r\n\tsanga-dosa-hara hi te (SB 3.25.24)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“O My mother, O virtuous lady, these are the qualities of great devotees who are free from all attachment. You must seek attachment to such holy men, for this counteracts the pernicious effects of material attachment.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe devotee’s greatest fear, wherever he may be, is to forget the Lord. Therefore he always prays, “Let me remember You. Always keep me in the association of Your devotees. Let me always be hearing Your glories in the association of Your devotees.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Haridasa was asked for a benediction from the Lord, he said,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“I am going to ask You for something but forgive me for being so arrogant for asking for something very high. Please birth after birth let me have the remnants of the foodstuff of Your devotees. Just keep me somehow in the association of Your devotees.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is how a devotee finds his shelter – by always staying in the association of devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNarada Muni said to King Pracinabarhisat,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“In the place where My pure devotees congregate always discussing the pastimes of the Lord if one gets the chance to hear the river of nectar which flows like the waves of the river, if one gets caught up in that flow of the nectar coming from the devotees, then one will forget about all the necessities of live, such as hunger and thirst and one will become free from all kinds of illusion, lamentation and fear.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is like getting caught up in a tsunami. You cannot do anything, you are caught. When you get caught up in these waves of the devotees who are always discussing the glories of the Lord, it is the best opportunity to remember the Lord. Not only does one feel sheltered by remembering the Lord, but as Queen Kunti is praying here, “The Lord is so kindly remembering me. He is remembering me because I developed the urge to hear His messages.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah<br />\r\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah<br />\r\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani<br />\r\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam (SB 1.2.17)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord is sitting within the heart of every living being. He remembers that devotee who develops the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted. What does He do? Not only does He remember His devotee, but He acts within the heart to remove all the obstacles within the heart of that devotee in order to make that devotee’s heart pure and clean. The devotee feels,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“The Lord is so kind. He remembers me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust by developing the urge to hear about Him constantly, the Lord acts within the heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tQueen Kunti is praying this way also. She says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Our welfare is assured only when You remember us and gave us Your protection.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese three verses here help us to understand this unique characteristic of Lord’s pure devotees. Although sometimes we have a tendency to think,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“This is the Lord’s pure devotee but what does this have to do with me? There are always these pure devotees we hear about in Srimad Bhagavatam, but what does that have to do with us?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt has a lot to do with us. Although Srimad Bhagavatam may not be speaking about us, for anyone who develops the faith and desire to hear about these pure devotees, Krsna accepts that desire to hear as service to Him. Simply by cultivating the desire to hear about these devotees, Krsna accepts that as service to Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Krsna says in the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Having awaken the faith in hearing the narration of My glories, being disgusted with sense gratification, knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering but still not able to give it up, My devotee continues to worship Me with faith and remains happy, because My devotee knows that even though sense gratification leads to suffering and he cannot give it up, because he has awakened faith in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, he sincerely repents any sense gratification he commits.” (SB 11.20.27-28)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe devotee has faith in the Lord's kindness. The devotee thinks, “If I simply go on hearing, Krsna will act from within the heart and He’ll remove all obstacles and impediments from within my heart. I'm convinced He will help me by my constant endeavor to hear about Him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttesam satata-yuktanam<br />\r\n\tbhajatam priti-purvakam<br />\r\n\tdadami buddhi-yogam tam<br />\r\n\tyena mam upayanti te (Bg 10.10)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord will remove all obstacles from within. That’s how He acts within the heart of a devotee. Within the heart of non-devotee – it’s a different story. He doesn’t have to be so directly involved. He is simply there as a witness and giving sanction. There is no lila. He is like a desire-tree, simply allowing them. “You do not take shelter of Me? OK. Material nature will take care of everything for you. But My devotee who always remembers Me, who always endeavors,”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttesam evanukampartham<br />\r\n\taham ajnana-jam tamah<br />\r\n\tnasayamy atma-bhava-stho<br />\r\n\tjnana-dipena bhasvata (Bg 10.11)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Just out of compassion for them I will destroy with a shining lamp of knowledge the darkness of ignorance. I will help them to come to Me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord gives special attention to those who take shelter in these transcendental narrations. This is, of course, the benefit of hearing about such great devotees as Queen Kunti and hearing her realization about the nature of the Lord’s reciprocal love to those who exclusively love Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaybe I should end here. You were going to speak (to Radhanatha Maharaja), and I need to hear. And I do not need to hear anything about me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRadhanatha Swami: I would like to express deep gratitude to HH Niranjana Swami Maharaja for this eloquent, purely devotional tsunami of hari-katha.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaharaja was speaking of Queen Kunti’s prayers. In the First Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam we find the scene after the battle of Kuruksetra, after the Pandavas were victorious. Yudhisthira Maharaja was coronated as king and everything seems very peaceful. Queen Kunti is offering her prayers, because Krsna is about to leave, and she is praying, “Let these calamities happen again and again.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we read these stories, we should read or hear not only with our ears and our mind’s attention but with our heart also. Sometimes we think we are in a difficult situation, but really what were Kunti’s calamities she was talking about? We just heard how her own relatives, her own nephews were trying to kill her children in the house of lac to literally burn them to death. She was with them at that time. Somehow or other Vidura helped them and they escaped. Vidura was her brother-in-law. And then we find they were exiled. She saw Draupadi being insulted. During the battlefield of Kuruksetra she saw her eldest son, Karna, whom she loved as much as her other children, and her other son Arjuna to be the worst enemies who wanted to destroy each other. And then she saw one of her children kill her other child – Arjuna killed Karna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose of you who are mothers what kind of distress would that have in your heart? Abhumanyu was her grandchild. She saw him slaughtered by unfair means. She witnessed the pain of Subhadra and Arjuna, the mother and father. She saw five of her other grandchildren, a child from each of her sons to Draupadi, slaughtered while they were sleeping by Asvatthama, killed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI am a Swami, I don’t know so much about the direct experience of these things but I see grandparents usually love children as much or more than the parents themselves. She saw her son die at the hands of another son. She saw six of her grandchildren die in most ignoble way, not chivalrously. These are serious calamities. They weren’t just things that happened to her. They were things that she was seeing happen to those whom she loved most. And yet she is praying to Krsna, “Let those calamities happen again and again, because in these situations I remember You. I have no one else to turn except You. I have no other shelter, and in seeing You and remembering You, I see You, and seeing You I don’t have to experience birth and death anymore.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe calamities of death, the calamities of being cheated, the calamities of physical pains watching her five children and their wife living in the exile in the forest and being hunted – it was very difficult. If she could have been there with them, it would have been much easier. But she wasn’t allowed to go with them. She was at Vidura’s house in Hastinapura. And she would have to hear about these things. She would hear nasty, terrible rumors being spread around Hastinapura by Duryodhana about her own children.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the exalted status of Kunti. If she was some sort of hard-hearted, detached yogini, it wouldn’t have been the same type of prayer. But devotees have soft hearts. She was a mother. She was a grandmother. She was a wife and her husband died. Practically everything possible we could think that could happen to a person happened to her. And it’s not that she didn’t suffer but in that suffering she was experiencing the eternal joy of remembering Krsna. The more desperate the suffering, the more desperately she took shelter of Krsna. And that is the meaning of this prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada said whether we would pray for calamities or not, they will come. Really we don’t have to pray like Kunti for calamities, they will come anyway. Everyone is going to die anyway. The setbacks of this world, the reversals, unfairness of envious people – it is all going to come upon us. The real prayer is in all circumstances to remember You, Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHer own daughter-in-law, Draupadi… What is the most famous, inspiring story of Draupadi? How many times do we hear in lectures about how happy she was when she was to marry Arjuna or how happy she was when Bhima prepared a nice feast for her? But when she was being stripped naked by Duhsasana and there was no one who was protecting her, she felt utterly betrayed by everyone she trusted in this world. In that stage she understood, “Only Krsna is my real fried who can save me.” And she helplessly lifted her arms and cried out, “Hey, Krsna! Hey, Govinda!” In the intensity of her surrender, saranagati, Krsna appeared before her. That is the glory of her life, that instant that inspires people five millenniums later more than any other. Kunti was watching all these things happen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis Holiness Niranjana Maharaja was speaking about the daydreams and the night dreams. Srila Prabhupada would write to us, all of his devotees, “I hope this meets you in good health.” What’s this health? Of course, spiritual health, but he was also talking about emotional health and physical health, too. If it is all a dream, who cares? The bodies are just a dream and miseries we are going through are just a dream… Who cares? Why even try to liberate people, because whatever suffering we are going through is just a dream anyway?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe soul is eternal. The soul is full of bliss. Because a devotee, although he or she understands the nature of these good dreams and bad dreams, daydreams and night dreams, still it’s the atma that is identifying with it. The devotee feels compassion. What does Prabhupada mean when he says para-dukha-dukhi, a devotee suffers when he sees others suffering and he is happy when he sees others happy? If all the suffering is just a dream, why should we suffer when we see others suffering a dream?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt’s because the eternal soul, a part of Krsna, is loved so much by Krsna. If Krsna loves us, therefore a devotee loves us. Identifying with this dream is what causes us suffering. Devotees feel suffering when they see others suffering. But there is a difference, because when an ordinary materially-oriented person suffers to see another suffer, we just try to make a make-shift change of the dream, from a suffering dream to a more happy dream. That’s all a material person can do. But a devotee wants to wake us up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn Sri Caitanya Caritamrita Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was speaking to Haridasa Thakura and He was really suffering. He said, “My heart is feeling such pain to see all the people suffering in this material world in forgetfulness of Krsna.” Haridasa Thakura said, “But You came here to wake them up from the dream of the suffering, from the bad and good suffering, because You have come to this world and You have personally chanted the holy name.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tjiva jago, jiv jago, gauracanda bole<br />\r\n\tkota nidra jao maya-pisacira kole\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe daydream because we are sleeping on the lap of maya, of illusion. And yes, we feel for people who are dreaming in this way. Good dream, bad dream – it is all bad, because it’s all distracting us from our true natural wakeful state. jivera 'svarupa' haya-krsnera 'nitya-dasa.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe are all eternal servants of Krsna and love for Krsna is our true nature. But actually to understand this, mahajano yena gatah sa panthah, we must follow in the footsteps of great souls. And the great souls come to this world and pass through situations that are very similar to us but they show us how to do it. And that is Kunti.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe didn't select the sufferings. She didn't place an order on the internet, “Let my five grandchildren die. Let Abhimanyu die. Let my elder son be killed by my younger son.” These were&nbsp; things she was trying to avoid like anything because she's&nbsp; a mother and a grandmother. Whatever could pain her heart the most, it all happened. But she never felt, “Krsna, why?” She understood that Krsna is her only shelter and she understood that by taking shelter of Krsna, Krsna would give his highest mercy to all of her loved ones and to everyone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn today’s verses, which is from the Tenth Canto, Kunti is in a very different situation, because in the First Canto we read “The war is over.” All the problems have already happened. Now Yudhisthira Maharaja is king. And she is offering her prayers to Krsna, “This is the most difficult moment of my life now, because You are leaving us. When the calamities were here we were always together. You were always with us, but now when everything is all right, I may forget You.” That was her prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut it today’s verses it’s right in the middle of everything. While she is speaking to Krsna, Duryodhana is in the palace, Karna is in the palace, Sakuni, Duhsasana – they are all there. What is going to happen next? They just tried to murder and burn alive the Pandavas. The Pandavas were hiding, they were coming back and she knows the envy and the hatred of her nephews is worse than ever. But Kunti in her gracious, divine, motherly nature has simply given her heart to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis Holiness Niranjana Swami Maharaja has so eloquently told how Krsna gave His heart to Ambarisa Maharaja. So when Durvasa Muni said, “Please have a heart. Protect me. I am taking shelter of You.” So beautifully he explained, “I don’t have My heart. Ambarisa has My heart. You have to go to him.” That is actually – that principle of how a devotee gives his or her heart fully to Krsna and Krsna reciprocates by giving His heart to His devotee – that is the ultimate culmination of all knowledge, of all the scriptures. That is truly the essence. Whatever rules, regulations or philosophical explanations may be there, this pastime of the Lord being subordinate to the devotee’s love and a devotee being subordinate to the Lord’s love is the essence of all truths.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat is what Srila Prabhupada came to give us. Who are we to understand the essence of all truths? But if we have a simple heart with faith to receive it and, as Maharaja said, if we actually take great happiness in hearing about the great devotees of the Lord – what is their love for the Lord and what is the Lord’s love for the devotees – just by developing that taste to appreciate another Vaisnava’s love, that is actually how the doors to our hearts open to receive that love ourselves. It’s most important.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuryodhana was living with the Pandavas. They loved Krsna but he didn't appreciate their love. He was envious of the blessings they were receiving.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada explains that if we are not envious, if we have a simple heart, and we can appreciate the devotion of others and appreciate the blessings that Krsna is giving others, and appreciate how Krsna is conquered by the love of the devotee, and how a devotee is conquered by the love of Krsna, and that mainly comes through hearing. Then we become qualified also. Queen Kunti’s prayer:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tvipadah santu tah sasvat<br />\r\n\ttatra tatra jagad-guro<br />\r\n\tbhavato darsanam yat syad<br />\r\n\tapunar bhava-darsanam (SB 1.8.25)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Let calamities come again and again so that I can remember You.”, you will never be able to understand that prayer just through philosophy. It’s too much beyond philosophy. We can only understand that prayer when we receive Krsna's grace. And Krsna will give us that grace when we learn to love and appreciate those to whom He has given His heart. This is really what it means to be the servant of the servant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThank you His Holiness Niranjana Swami Maharaja. And I want to say one thing to you. You may be a little proud by how you clapped for him, but in Ukraine they clap at least a million times louder.\r\n</p>\r\n",

Thus she addressed Lord Krisna, who appears before His devotees to drive away their distress.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttadaiva kusalam no 'bhut<br />\n\tsa-nathas te krta vayam<br />\n\tjnatin nah smarata krsna<br />\n\tbhrata me presitas tvaya\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“[Queen Kunti said:] My dear Krisna, our welfare was assured only when You remembered us, Your relatives, and gave us Your protection by sending my brother to visit us.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tna te 'sti sva-para-bhrantir<br />\n\tvisvasya suhrd-atmanah<br />\n\ttathapi smaratam sasvat<br />\n\tklesan hamsi hrdi sthitah\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“For You, the well-wishing friend and Supreme Soul of the universe, there is never any illusion of “us” and “them.” Yet even so, residing within the hearts of all, You eradicate the sufferings of those who remember You constantly.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe intelligent Queen Kunti here points out that even though Lord Krsna is dealing with her affectionately as a relative, He is not compromising His position as the well-wishing Soul of the universe. In other words, the Lord doesn’t play favorites. As He says in the Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo ‘ham sarva-bhutesu, “I am equal to everyone.” So while the Lord reciprocates with all souls, it is natural that those who love Him intensely receive His special attention, for they want Him and nothing else.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHere, in these three verses, we are getting an opportunity to hear a wonderful expression of deep attachment within the heart of Queen Kunti. As we know from her prayers in the First Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, when Krsna appeared before her, she was remembering many troubles she and her sons endured.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShe prayed, “My dear Krsna, Your Lordship has protected us from a poisoned cake, from a great fire, from cannibals, from the vicious assembly, from sufferings during our exile in the forest and from the battle where great generals fought. And now You have saved us from the weapon of Asvatthama. (SB 1.8.24)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in the next well-known verse she says:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tvipadah santu tah sasvat<br />\n\ttatra tatra jagad-guro<br />\n\tbhavato darsanam yat syad<br />\n\tapunar bhava-darsanam (SB 1.8.25)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that we could see You again and again, for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we reflect on this verse, we can become bewildered as to how such a prayer can be made. When comparing it to our own lives, are we  prepared to ask for calamities as severe as those which were endured by Kunti and Pandavas? Are we prepared to take shelter under every circumstance as they always did being confident of the Lord’s constant protection?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe protection described here is, “We remembered you and understood that you were thinking of us.” Just that thought in itself, for Kunti, was a great solace to know that the Lord was thinking of her and her sons.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore in the next verse she says, “Our welfare was assured only when You remembered us, Your relatives, and gave us Your protection by sending my brother to visit us.” She is referring here to Akrura. Here in this verse she is saying, “You are the well-wishing friend and the Supreme Soul of the universe and there is never any illusion of ‘us’ and ‘them.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, she is explaining that it appears that He is showing some partiality, because, “You are the well-wishing friend of everyone but even though You are residing in everyone’s heart and You are the well-wisher of all living beings, You are giving special attention to those who always remember You.” And she is feeling that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Krsna says:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsamo 'ham sarva-bhutesu<br />\n\tna me dvesyo 'sti na priyah<br />\n\tye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya<br />\n\tmayi te tesu capy aham (Bg 9.29) (15:43:42)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am not envious of anyone. I am equal to all, but whoever renders service to Me is a friend to Me and I am a friend to them.” Being situated in the heart of all living beings, the Lord is equal to everyone and reciprocates according to the mood of their worship.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn connection to this verse, Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives an analogy of a wish-fulfilling desire tree. He explains that a wish-fulfilling desire tree will give fruit according to the mood of those who take shelter of it. Whatever fruit one wishes from this tree, the wish-fulfilling desire tree reciprocates accordingly. It’s equally disposed to fulfill the desires of everyone who takes shelter of that tree. But obviously those who don’t take shelter of it don’t get any result.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the same way the Supreme Personality of Godhead also differentiates between those who take shelter of Him and those who don’t take shelter of Him. He gives different results accordingly, just like the desire-tree.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that the speciality of the Lord in comparison to wish-fulfilling desire tree is that the desire tree will not become subordinate to those who worship it, whereas the Supreme Lord will become subordinate to His devotees or to those who possess bhakti. Therefore, the qualities we may see in the Supreme Lord – that He sometimes displays – such as friendship, hatred or indifference, are simply due to the relationship with bhakti, because it’s bhakti that controls the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tna sadhayati mam yogo<br />\n\tna sankhyam dharma uddhava<br />\n\tna svadhyayas tapas tyago<br />\n\tyatha bhaktir mamorjita (SB 11.14.20)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna tells Uddhava, “Unalloyed devotional service rendered to Me by My devotee brings Me under the control of the devotee.” That’s His speciality. That’s the difference between the Lord and the desire tree. The desire tree will give certain results according to the mood of the worshipper. Those who don’t take shelter get a different result. The Lord does the same thing. He is impartial, He maintains His impartiality. But for the devotee, as herein explained, while the Lord reciprocates with all souls, it is natural that those who love Him intensely receive His special attention because they want Him and nothing else.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the unique characteristic of a devotee. When his heart is filled with bhakti, then the Lord feels bound to reciprocate. This is the well-known quality described as bhakta-vatsalya.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also explains elsewhere that one should never think that this bhakta-vatsalya is mundane partiality. It appears like the Lord is playing favorites, but actually this quality is an ornament of the Lord. The word given is bhusana. It’s the one quality of the Supreme Lord which reconciles any apparent contradictions one may perceive His behavior. All  contradictions can be reconciled by this one quality. Krsna will always be consistent in this regard. This reciprocal love which manifests because of the devotee's exclusive dependence, is natural. How can the Lord not reciprocate? He is equal to everyone.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you exclusively depend on the Lord, then naturally the Lord will think, “This devotee who is depending on Me exclusively, how can I neglect him? How can I not reciprocate? How can I not give him My attention? How can I not remember him? He is always remembering Me. How can I not remember him?” It’s natural. It’s reciprocal.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the Lord thinks this way about His devotees by always remembering them, He displays this quality, this characteristic which is so much relished and appreciated by His devotees – how the Lord is so merciful, so kind –  that He can never forget anyone who renders service to Him. He never forgets even the small amount of service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis point was is made clear with Durvasa Muni, to whom the Lord appeared to be indifferent. You then may say, “If He is equal to everyone, then how can He be indifferent to Durvasa Muni?” Because bhakti was present within Ambarisa Maharaja. Due to Ambarisa Maharaja's bhakti the Lord appeared to manifest indifference when Durvasa Muni appealed to the Lord and the Lord then responded with the well-known verse, “I am completely under the control of My devotee. I am never, not for a moment, independent from My devotee. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat was Durvasa Muni asking? He was appealing, “Look! I’ve gone to Brahma, I’ve gone to Siva. I’ve been chased by Sudarsana cakra. They were incapable of helping. They could not give me any shelter. They told me it was beyond their ability to do anything. But I know it’s not beyond Your ability to do something. You are the person who invoked this cakra, so now I’ve come before You and I am taking shelter of You. Please protect me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura elaborates on this well-known conversation between Durvasa Muni and the Lord:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve come to You for shelter. Please think about my situation and manifest Your heart for someone who has come to You for shelter.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the Lord is indifferent.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Sorry. I can’t do anything to help you.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“What do you mean You can’t do anything to help me?”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord then describes how the bhakti in the heart of Maharaja Ambarisa was controlling Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The devotee is always in My heart and I am always in the heart of My devotee. The devotee doesn’t think of anyone but Me, and I never think of anyone but him.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord then further explains,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Maharaja Ambarisa takes Me into the core of his heart and he serves Me so very nicely there. And because he serves Me so nicely within his heart, naturally I want to reciprocate. Therefore I ask My devotee, ‘Please let me give you something.'”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s natural. The Lord wants to give something in return. But when He tries to offer something to His devotee, His devotee says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am not interested in that. I don’t want wealth. I don’t want fame. I don’t want power.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord says, “What can I offer you?”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t want anything. Just let me remember You.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe see so many prayers in the Bhagavatam when the devotees, in the Lord's presence, are asked,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“What can I give you?”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the devotees say, “Please let me remember You. Please let me be counted as one of Your devotees. Wherever I may go, whatever birth I may take, please recognize me as Your devotee.”... as spoken by Lord Brahma.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOr His devotees may say, “Wherever I may take my birth please let me take birth in the association of Your devotees so that I can always remember You by hearing Your glories in their association.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe devotee doesn't ask for anything other than to serve Him in constant remembrance of Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJust like the well-known response Prahlada Maharaja gave when Lord Nrsimhadeva asked Prahlada, “Please let Me give you a benediction.” Prahlada said to the Lord, “I am not a merchant. Don’t forget I was born in a family of demons. Don’t tempt me like this. I am not engaged in Your service for something in return. Just be my master and let me be Your servant birth after birth and then I will be happy.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is a devotee. A devotee simply wants the opportunity to remember and serve the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tContinuing with Visvanath Cakravarti Thakura's explanation... Durvasa Muni was pleading,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Please I am taking shelter of You. To whom else can I go for protection? Consider my situation and protect me. Please have a heart.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord responded, “No, sorry.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“What do you mean?” asks Durvasa.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“My devotee is so dear to Me. I ask him again and again 'Please let Me give you something' but he does not want Me to give him anything. Because of his deep love for Me, he never wants anything else. So I had to give him something you're asking from Me personally but I don’t have it available right now. You are asking Me to have a heart. Sorry. Not there. You are asking Me to think of you. Sorry, I don’t even have My mind, because My thoughts are always with My devotee. He is always thinking of Me and I am always thinking of him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough My devotee doesn’t want anything I still want to give him something. Therefore, I give him the most valuable treasure I have in My treasure house. What could I give him that he will consider of value? I gave him My heart. So now you're asking for My heart, but I am telling you it’s not there.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis perfect example shows how bhakti controls the Lord. The Lord’s apparent indifference towards Durvasa has nothing to do with Durvasa Muni. It's connected with Maharaja Ambarisa’s bhakti.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, wherever the Lord also displays either friendship or hatred…\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJust like the Lord told Duryodhana, “Because you are envious of the Pandavas, because you are their enemy, therefore you are My enemy.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDuryodhana invited the Lord to his home but the Lord was not willing to accept his invitation. He said,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“No. You are the enemy of the Pandavas. They are fully dependent on Me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHis apparent enmity toward Duryodhana was not directly with Duryodhana, but it was due to the presence of bhakti in the hearts of the Pandavas. He is controlled by their bhakti. Although He is equal to everyone, the speciality of the Lord’s quality which is different from the desire tree is that the Lord becomes subordinate to his devotee.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore whatever may appear to be like friendship… Krsna says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Whoever renders service to Me is a friend to Me and I am a friend to them.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs explained here, He is not compromising His position as the well-wishing soul of the universe. In other words, the Lord is not playing favorites. He is not absorbed in this mentality or as the verse itself says, “For you the well-wishing friend, the soul of the universe there is never illusion of ‘us’ and ‘them.’”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat mentality comes into the mind of a person who thinks, “Because you are my friend I am your friend. If you are not my friend, you have enmity towards me, then I am not your friend.  My friend is on my side, so we are together.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the Lord does not think “us” and “them” in relationship to Himself. There’s no enemy for the Lord. Nobody is successful in being an enemy of the Lord. Neither does the Lord deal with anyone as His enemy, because whatever the Lord does is always for the ultimate benefit even of one who is apparently His enemy.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the Lord kills demons, they get liberation. Whatever the Lord does is always for the benefit of the recipient. He is not like a politician who needs to stay in his position because he is getting support from his friends and if you are not supporting him you are his enemies. The Lord doesn’t need votes to stay in his position as the Supreme Lord. He is the Lord and it doesn’t make any difference for Him if anyone votes for Him or not. He still is the Supreme Lord. That is His position.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord explains in the Twelfth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita that “...for those who are always meditating on Me, I become the swift deliverer of repeated birth and death.” He delivers them, frees them from all distresses.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s a verse in the Third Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tmad-asrayah katha mrstah<br />\n\tsrnvanti kathayanti ca<br />\n\ttapanti vividhas tapa<br />\n\tnaitan mad-gata-cetasah (SB 3.25.23)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Kapiladeva says to Devahuti, “Engaged constantly in chanting and hearing about Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sadhus do not suffer from material miseries because they are always filled with thoughts of My pastimes and activities.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA devotee, in all circumstances naturally -- spontaneously-- remembers the Lord. We were just speaking from a verse from Bhagavatam in Mayapur the other day.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“As one mistakenly considers a flower garland to be a snake or experiences happiness and distress in a dream, so, in the material world, by a lack of careful consideration, we differentiate between happiness and distress, considering one good and the other bad.” (6.17.30)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis verse comes just after the well-known verse spoken by Lord Siva.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tParvati was astonished. She couldn’t understand. “How is it that I just gave a curse to Citraketu Maharaja to take birth as a demon, Citraketu Maharaja understood fully what that curse meant – He would take birth as a demon – but he has no fear. He is ready fully accept that curse.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCitraketu came down from his plane before Siva and Parvati and was completely equipoised.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ll accept whatever your will is.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Siva explained that that is the nature of bhakti. That is a devotee.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tnarayana-parah sarve<br />\n\tna kutascana bibhyati<br />\n\tsvargapavarga-narakesv<br />\n\tapi tulyartha-darsinah (SB 6.17.28)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayaṇa, never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA devotee doesn’t fear any condition of life, whether he is in heaven or hell, whether he is liberated. For him it’s all the same. Why? Because for a devotee whether he is in heaven, in hell or liberated, he is interested in one thing only – service. That is all. One of the most favorable ways to render service to the Lord is to constantly remember Him under all circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the verses just after, Lord Siva begins to describe the nature of the duality of the material world. When speaking from that verse, we quoted Lord Caitanya:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tdvaite' bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba -- ‘manodharma'<br />\n\t'ei bhala, ei manda', -- ei saba ‘bhrama' (CC Antya 4.176)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“In the material world to say ‘this is good’ and ‘this is bad’ is a mental speculation.” Therefore to say “this is good” and “this is bad” is all a mistake.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder the influence of duality in this material world we tend to think “this is good” and “this is bad” in terms “this is pleasing, it makes me happy,” “this is bad – it causes my suffering.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada explains in that commentary that in the material world, there is duality consciousness. But there’s no such thing as good or bad. It’s all a mistake. It has nothing to do with the transcendental platform. Those who are in the transcendental consciousness see that even miseries of the material world as happiness, and material happiness as misery.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen Prabhupada quotes the verse,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate<br />\n\tdurdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate<br />\n\tvisvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate<br />\n\tyat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah (Caitanya-candramrta 5)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"For a devotee who has received Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's merciful glance, kaivalya, merging into the existence of Brahman, appears hellish, the heavenly planets appear like phantasmagoria, the senses appear like serpents with broken teeth, the entire world becomes a replica of Vaikuntha, and the position of demigods headed by Lord Brahma and Lord Indra is considered equal to that of a tiny insect.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada's purport to the verse we spoke on in Mayapura was all about dreams, how in the material world there are bad dreams and good dreams. We think, “This is a bad dream” or, “This is a good dream,” but the happiness and distress we experience are only in relationship to dreams.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe gave an example from the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam that was given by the sage Kavi, one of the nine Yogendras, in his conversation with Maharaja Nimi. When Maharaja Nimi was asking about the nature of devotional service and how to become freed from fear, the sage Kavi explained that fear arises due to being absorbed in the material consciousness and bodily concept of life, thinking that one is a material body, and therefore by forgetting Krsna one forgets that he is the eternal servant of Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the next verse he says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Although the duality of the material world does not ultimately exist, the conditioned soul experiences it as real under the influence of his own conditioned intelligence. This imaginary experience of a world separate from Krsna can be compared to the acts of dreaming and desiring. When the conditioned soul dreams at night of something desirable or horrible, or when he daydreams of what he would like to have or avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his own imagination.” (SB 11.2.38)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe uses this analogy in relationship to dreams. Everyone can relate to dreaming because most people have dreams. Prabhupada even uses an analogy to help us understand the importance of analogies. He says that if you want to see the moon moving in the sky at night, you can stare at the moon, but it’s very difficult to see how it is moving by this way. But if you look at the moon through the branches of a tree, because the branches are closer, you can see from this branch to that branch how the moon is moving. Similarly we need analogies, something closer to us, within our realm of experience, to help us understand something that may seem too theoretical.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we have a dream, a very good dream. Has anyone had a good dream before?  [Mostly everyone raises their hand]. Has anyone had a bad dream before? [Mostly everyone raises their hand once again]. Ok you can relate to this then.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you have a good dream and you are enjoying it, because usually a good dream means that it's enjoyable,  then all of a sudden something happens and you wake up, you are sad,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was a dream. I thought it was so real. But it was a dream.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you feel very sad. But when you have a bad dream... for instance, you're being eaten by a tiger.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, I have this experience a lot, because I fly a lot. While I'm on a plane, I may fall asleep and I start dreaming that the plane is falling very fast (laughter) and I wake up and I am happy (more laughter). “It was only a dream!”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKavi explains that the happiness we feel in relationship to a bad dream and distress we feel in relationship to a good dream are not connected to reality, they are only connected to a dream. There is no connection to reality at all. So that’s the night dream.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen there is the daydream. The daydream is no different than the night dream. In the daydream we dream of something we would like to have and we feel happy. “Yes, I feel good. I'd really like to have that.” But because it’s not connected to reality and because we are trying to enjoy something separate from Krsna, when we get the fulfillment of our so-called daydream, it generally does not quite fit the bill. It didn’t bring us all the happiness we expected especially when we lose it or we see the other problems we didn't anticipate, that come with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s the daydream – things that we would like to have. Then there are things we would like to avoid. For instance, everybody tries to avoid death, disease, suffering.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes people even think that they are happy if they are not suffering.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“How are you, Prabhu?”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Things aren't that bad. I guess I must be happy.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there's much more to happiness than not suffering. We think of happiness and distress in relationship to the daydream, but there's really no difference between that and the happiness and distress in relationship to the night dream.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada quoted in the commentary to that Sixth Canto verse, “visvam purna-sukhayate”... for a devotee, for one who gets that merciful glance of Lord Caitanya, the whole universe becomes ecstatic. The devotee can be happy even when he's experiencing so-called distress.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter class one devotee came up to me and asked, “Maharaja, how can we be happy in distress?” I tried to explain to him about example we just gave about Queen Kunti and then I tried to explain the verse:\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttat te 'nukampam su-samiksamano<br />\n\tbhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam<br />\n\thrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te<br />\n\tjiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak (SB 10.14.8)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t...how a devotee tolerates all the distresses of his life because it gives him the opportunity to remember the Lord. What is the spontaneous nature of a devotee? What is the test of a devotee? The test of a devotee is that in the face of adversity, a devotee does not ask the Lord to counteract his difficulty.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, Ambarisa Maharaja didn’t ask to counteract the difficulty he was put in. He just very naturally remembered the Lord. That's what was most natural for him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada explains in one purport in the chapter about Maharaja Ambarisa that Maharaja Ambarisa simply did what was natural for him. He didn’t say to the Lord, “Protect me.” He just naturally remembered the Lord and felt completely protected. And because he was completely dependent on the Lord, the Lord felt compelled to arrange to protect him, even though Ambarisa Maharaja was not asking for it. The devotee feels sheltered, even in the face of adversity, by remembering the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tmad-asrayah katha mrstah<br />\n\tsrnvanti kathayanti ca<br />\n\ttapanti vividhas tapa<br />\n\tnaitan mad-gata-cetasah (SB 3.25.23)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Engaged constantly in chanting and hearing about Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sadhus do not suffer from material miseries because they are always filled with thoughts of My pastimes and activities.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the next verse Lord Kapiladeva says:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi<br />\n\tsarva-sanga-vivarjitah<br />\n\tsangas tesv atha te prarthyah<br />\n\tsanga-dosa-hara hi te (SB 3.25.24)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“O My mother, O virtuous lady, these are the qualities of great devotees who are free from all attachment. You must seek attachment to such holy men, for this counteracts the pernicious effects of material attachment.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe devotee’s greatest fear, wherever he may be, is to forget the Lord. Therefore he always prays, “Let me remember You. Always keep me in the association of Your devotees. Let me always be hearing Your glories in the association of Your devotees.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Haridasa was asked for a benediction from the Lord, he said,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am going to ask You for something but forgive me for being so arrogant for asking for something very high. Please birth after birth let me have the remnants of the foodstuff of Your devotees. Just keep me somehow in the association of Your devotees.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is how a devotee finds his shelter – by always staying in the association of devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNarada Muni said to King Pracinabarhisat,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“In the place where My pure devotees congregate always discussing the pastimes of the Lord if one gets the chance to hear the river of nectar which flows like the waves of the river, if one gets caught up in that flow of the nectar coming from the devotees, then one will forget about all the necessities of live, such as hunger and thirst and one will become free from all kinds of illusion, lamentation and fear.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is like getting caught up in a tsunami. You cannot do anything, you are caught. When you get caught up in these waves of the devotees who are always discussing the glories of the Lord, it is the best opportunity to remember the Lord. Not only does one feel sheltered by remembering the Lord, but as Queen Kunti is praying here, “The Lord is so kindly remembering me. He is remembering me because I developed the urge to hear His messages.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah<br />\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah<br />\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani<br />\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam (SB 1.2.17)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord is sitting within the heart of every living being. He remembers that devotee who develops the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted. What does He do? Not only does He remember His devotee, but He acts within the heart to remove all the obstacles within the heart of that devotee in order to make that devotee’s heart pure and clean. The devotee feels,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Lord is so kind. He remembers me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJust by developing the urge to hear about Him constantly, the Lord acts within the heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQueen Kunti is praying this way also. She says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our welfare is assured only when You remember us and gave us Your protection.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese three verses here help us to understand this unique characteristic of Lord’s pure devotees. Although sometimes we have a tendency to think,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is the Lord’s pure devotee but what does this have to do with me? There are always these pure devotees we hear about in Srimad Bhagavatam, but what does that have to do with us?”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt has a lot to do with us. Although Srimad Bhagavatam may not be speaking about us, for anyone who develops the faith and desire to hear about these pure devotees, Krsna accepts that desire to hear as service to Him. Simply by cultivating the desire to hear about these devotees, Krsna accepts that as service to Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Krsna says in the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Having awaken the faith in hearing the narration of My glories, being disgusted with sense gratification, knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering but still not able to give it up, My devotee continues to worship Me with faith and remains happy, because My devotee knows that even though sense gratification leads to suffering and he cannot give it up, because he has awakened faith in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, he sincerely repents any sense gratification he commits.” (SB 11.20.27-28)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe devotee has faith in the Lord's kindness. The devotee thinks, “If I simply go on hearing, Krsna will act from within the heart and He’ll remove all obstacles and impediments from within my heart. I'm convinced He will help me by my constant endeavor to hear about Him.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttesam satata-yuktanam<br />\n\tbhajatam priti-purvakam<br />\n\tdadami buddhi-yogam tam<br />\n\tyena mam upayanti te (Bg 10.10)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord will remove all obstacles from within. That’s how He acts within the heart of a devotee. Within the heart of non-devotee – it’s a different story. He doesn’t have to be so directly involved. He is simply there as a witness and giving sanction. There is no lila. He is like a desire-tree, simply allowing them. “You do not take shelter of Me? OK. Material nature will take care of everything for you. But My devotee who always remembers Me, who always endeavors,”\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttesam evanukampartham<br />\n\taham ajnana-jam tamah<br />\n\tnasayamy atma-bhava-stho<br />\n\tjnana-dipena bhasvata (Bg 10.11)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Just out of compassion for them I will destroy with a shining lamp of knowledge the darkness of ignorance. I will help them to come to Me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord gives special attention to those who take shelter in these transcendental narrations. This is, of course, the benefit of hearing about such great devotees as Queen Kunti and hearing her realization about the nature of the Lord’s reciprocal love to those who exclusively love Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMaybe I should end here. You were going to speak (to Radhanatha Maharaja), and I need to hear. And I do not need to hear anything about me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRadhanatha Swami: I would like to express deep gratitude to HH Niranjana Swami Maharaja for this eloquent, purely devotional tsunami of hari-katha.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMaharaja was speaking of Queen Kunti’s prayers. In the First Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam we find the scene after the battle of Kuruksetra, after the Pandavas were victorious. Yudhisthira Maharaja was coronated as king and everything seems very peaceful. Queen Kunti is offering her prayers, because Krsna is about to leave, and she is praying, “Let these calamities happen again and again.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we read these stories, we should read or hear not only with our ears and our mind’s attention but with our heart also. Sometimes we think we are in a difficult situation, but really what were Kunti’s calamities she was talking about? We just heard how her own relatives, her own nephews were trying to kill her children in the house of lac to literally burn them to death. She was with them at that time. Somehow or other Vidura helped them and they escaped. Vidura was her brother-in-law. And then we find they were exiled. She saw Draupadi being insulted. During the battlefield of Kuruksetra she saw her eldest son, Karna, whom she loved as much as her other children, and her other son Arjuna to be the worst enemies who wanted to destroy each other. And then she saw one of her children kill her other child – Arjuna killed Karna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThose of you who are mothers what kind of distress would that have in your heart? Abhumanyu was her grandchild. She saw him slaughtered by unfair means. She witnessed the pain of Subhadra and Arjuna, the mother and father. She saw five of her other grandchildren, a child from each of her sons to Draupadi, slaughtered while they were sleeping by Asvatthama, killed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI am a Swami, I don’t know so much about the direct experience of these things but I see grandparents usually love children as much or more than the parents themselves. She saw her son die at the hands of another son. She saw six of her grandchildren die in most ignoble way, not chivalrously. These are serious calamities. They weren’t just things that happened to her. They were things that she was seeing happen to those whom she loved most. And yet she is praying to Krsna, “Let those calamities happen again and again, because in these situations I remember You. I have no one else to turn except You. I have no other shelter, and in seeing You and remembering You, I see You, and seeing You I don’t have to experience birth and death anymore.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe calamities of death, the calamities of being cheated, the calamities of physical pains watching her five children and their wife living in the exile in the forest and being hunted – it was very difficult. If she could have been there with them, it would have been much easier. But she wasn’t allowed to go with them. She was at Vidura’s house in Hastinapura. And she would have to hear about these things. She would hear nasty, terrible rumors being spread around Hastinapura by Duryodhana about her own children.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the exalted status of Kunti. If she was some sort of hard-hearted, detached yogini, it wouldn’t have been the same type of prayer. But devotees have soft hearts. She was a mother. She was a grandmother. She was a wife and her husband died. Practically everything possible we could think that could happen to a person happened to her. And it’s not that she didn’t suffer but in that suffering she was experiencing the eternal joy of remembering Krsna. The more desperate the suffering, the more desperately she took shelter of Krsna. And that is the meaning of this prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada said whether we would pray for calamities or not, they will come. Really we don’t have to pray like Kunti for calamities, they will come anyway. Everyone is going to die anyway. The setbacks of this world, the reversals, unfairness of envious people – it is all going to come upon us. The real prayer is in all circumstances to remember You, Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHer own daughter-in-law, Draupadi… What is the most famous, inspiring story of Draupadi? How many times do we hear in lectures about how happy she was when she was to marry Arjuna or how happy she was when Bhima prepared a nice feast for her? But when she was being stripped naked by Duhsasana and there was no one who was protecting her, she felt utterly betrayed by everyone she trusted in this world. In that stage she understood, “Only Krsna is my real fried who can save me.” And she helplessly lifted her arms and cried out, “Hey, Krsna! Hey, Govinda!” In the intensity of her surrender, saranagati, Krsna appeared before her. That is the glory of her life, that instant that inspires people five millenniums later more than any other. Kunti was watching all these things happen.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHis Holiness Niranjana Maharaja was speaking about the daydreams and the night dreams. Srila Prabhupada would write to us, all of his devotees, “I hope this meets you in good health.” What’s this health? Of course, spiritual health, but he was also talking about emotional health and physical health, too. If it is all a dream, who cares? The bodies are just a dream and miseries we are going through are just a dream… Who cares? Why even try to liberate people, because whatever suffering we are going through is just a dream anyway?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe soul is eternal. The soul is full of bliss. Because a devotee, although he or she understands the nature of these good dreams and bad dreams, daydreams and night dreams, still it’s the atma that is identifying with it. The devotee feels compassion. What does Prabhupada mean when he says para-dukha-dukhi, a devotee suffers when he sees others suffering and he is happy when he sees others happy? If all the suffering is just a dream, why should we suffer when we see others suffering a dream?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s because the eternal soul, a part of Krsna, is loved so much by Krsna. If Krsna loves us, therefore a devotee loves us. Identifying with this dream is what causes us suffering. Devotees feel suffering when they see others suffering. But there is a difference, because when an ordinary materially-oriented person suffers to see another suffer, we just try to make a make-shift change of the dream, from a suffering dream to a more happy dream. That’s all a material person can do. But a devotee wants to wake us up.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Sri Caitanya Caritamrita Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was speaking to Haridasa Thakura and He was really suffering. He said, “My heart is feeling such pain to see all the people suffering in this material world in forgetfulness of Krsna.” Haridasa Thakura said, “But You came here to wake them up from the dream of the suffering, from the bad and good suffering, because You have come to this world and You have personally chanted the holy name.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tjiva jago, jiv jago, gauracanda bole<br />\n\tkota nidra jao maya-pisacira kole\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe daydream because we are sleeping on the lap of maya, of illusion. And yes, we feel for people who are dreaming in this way. Good dream, bad dream – it is all bad, because it’s all distracting us from our true natural wakeful state. jivera 'svarupa' haya-krsnera 'nitya-dasa.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are all eternal servants of Krsna and love for Krsna is our true nature. But actually to understand this, mahajano yena gatah sa panthah, we must follow in the footsteps of great souls. And the great souls come to this world and pass through situations that are very similar to us but they show us how to do it. And that is Kunti.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShe didn't select the sufferings. She didn't place an order on the internet, “Let my five grandchildren die. Let Abhimanyu die. Let my elder son be killed by my younger son.” These were  things she was trying to avoid like anything because she's  a mother and a grandmother. Whatever could pain her heart the most, it all happened. But she never felt, “Krsna, why?” She understood that Krsna is her only shelter and she understood that by taking shelter of Krsna, Krsna would give his highest mercy to all of her loved ones and to everyone.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn today’s verses, which is from the Tenth Canto, Kunti is in a very different situation, because in the First Canto we read “The war is over.” All the problems have already happened. Now Yudhisthira Maharaja is king. And she is offering her prayers to Krsna, “This is the most difficult moment of my life now, because You are leaving us. When the calamities were here we were always together. You were always with us, but now when everything is all right, I may forget You.” That was her prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it today’s verses it’s right in the middle of everything. While she is speaking to Krsna, Duryodhana is in the palace, Karna is in the palace, Sakuni, Duhsasana – they are all there. What is going to happen next? They just tried to murder and burn alive the Pandavas. The Pandavas were hiding, they were coming back and she knows the envy and the hatred of her nephews is worse than ever. But Kunti in her gracious, divine, motherly nature has simply given her heart to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHis Holiness Niranjana Swami Maharaja has so eloquently told how Krsna gave His heart to Ambarisa Maharaja. So when Durvasa Muni said, “Please have a heart. Protect me. I am taking shelter of You.” So beautifully he explained, “I don’t have My heart. Ambarisa has My heart. You have to go to him.” That is actually – that principle of how a devotee gives his or her heart fully to Krsna and Krsna reciprocates by giving His heart to His devotee – that is the ultimate culmination of all knowledge, of all the scriptures. That is truly the essence. Whatever rules, regulations or philosophical explanations may be there, this pastime of the Lord being subordinate to the devotee’s love and a devotee being subordinate to the Lord’s love is the essence of all truths.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is what Srila Prabhupada came to give us. Who are we to understand the essence of all truths? But if we have a simple heart with faith to receive it and, as Maharaja said, if we actually take great happiness in hearing about the great devotees of the Lord – what is their love for the Lord and what is the Lord’s love for the devotees – just by developing that taste to appreciate another Vaisnava’s love, that is actually how the doors to our hearts open to receive that love ourselves. It’s most important.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDuryodhana was living with the Pandavas. They loved Krsna but he didn't appreciate their love. He was envious of the blessings they were receiving.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada explains that if we are not envious, if we have a simple heart, and we can appreciate the devotion of others and appreciate the blessings that Krsna is giving others, and appreciate how Krsna is conquered by the love of the devotee, and how a devotee is conquered by the love of Krsna, and that mainly comes through hearing. Then we become qualified also. Queen Kunti’s prayer:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tvipadah santu tah sasvat<br />\n\ttatra tatra jagad-guro<br />\n\tbhavato darsanam yat syad<br />\n\tapunar bhava-darsanam (SB 1.8.25)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Let calamities come again and again so that I can remember You.”, you will never be able to understand that prayer just through philosophy. It’s too much beyond philosophy. We can only understand that prayer when we receive Krsna's grace. And Krsna will give us that grace when we learn to love and appreciate those to whom He has given His heart. This is really what it means to be the servant of the servant.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you His Holiness Niranjana Swami Maharaja. And I want to say one thing to you. You may be a little proud by how you clapped for him, but in Ukraine they clap at least a million times louder.\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is a partially edited transcription of a question and answer session with disciples, given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on September 25, 2016\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNRS: We don't have a lot of time, so I'm going to ask you to tell me what you want me to do. Do you want me to answer questions? Or do you want me to talk to you individually… or as a group? Usually, I let my disicples decide what they want from me when they ask for a separate meeting.&nbsp; Is there a spokesperson? Who is it? Mahendra? What should I talk about?&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMahendra: Your talk was about appreciation and respect and different devotees discussed amongst themselves in their chat and they wanted to ask you to enlighten them on that topic.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS: About respect? Why? Is there a reason this particular topic was selected?&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple: They want to draw a difference between what people call autocracy, in other words, when we respect the position of a person but not the person himself or herself. So the topic came about because of the desire to understand the difference between the two... internal respect towards the person regardless of his or her position, or external respect.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS: Oh that's interesting. Well, I'll speak&nbsp; briefly on that topic and then, if there's time, we'll go into it more deeply. If that's the question, then that's a little different from Mahendra's question… if we are now going to talk about autocracy, or I guess, managerial positions. I guess that's what she means by autocracy?&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple: Yes.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS: Well, I speak on this topic a lot. The answer may come as a surprise to you because it's so obvious. If you want to step out from restricted relationships based upon an external position, there's a very simple and foundational way to achieve that. I'll get to that in a moment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI frequently have discussions on this topic, especially with devotees who are in managerial councils. Because we are conditioned souls, we still identify with the material body, which means that we still identify with the designations of this body. Since our only true designation is that of a servant of Krsna, if we see everyone as servants of Krsna, then we can see the true equality of all living beings on the spiritual platform.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course there are servants of Krsna who please Krsna in different ways, but equally, we are still all servants of Krsna. Due to identification with the bodily designations, however, we make distinctions in the course of social interaction. In other words, how we interact with people in our daily activities is defined by our relationships and there can be a formal hierarchy in those relationships.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHierarchy exists on the external platform. But on the internal platform we are all servants of Krsna. Of course, there is also a spiritual hierarchy, but we won't discuss that now because the question is about external hierarchy and how to avoid getting caught up in the designations that exist in the external hierarchy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn social interaction, some persons are supposed to be seen as authorities. When accepted as authority then there is an interdependence in those relationships, such as \"I am your authority. You have to listen to me.\"... \"I'm the servant. I have to listen to you.\"… \"You are the authority but if you want my submission, you should respect me.\"… \"I'm your authority. You should respect me because I'm your authority.\" And as soon as we act according to external designations, this element of respect can be forced and unnatural.&nbsp; Not only can it become unnatural, but it can become oppressive if it's abused. Why? Because we still identify with our external designations and this influences the way we deal with others. This leads to disrespect.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe have been speaking a lot about disrespect based on the teachings of our acaryas. Disrespect towards another living being can be defined as purposely causing them suffering. Jiva Goswami quotes different verses on this topic, one of which is from the 11th Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe quotes about the suffering caused by arrows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Sharp arrows which pierce one's chest and reach the heart do not cause as much suffering as the arrows of harsh, insulting words that become lodged within the heart when spoken by uncivilized men.\" [SB 11.23.3]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe said that the pain caused by the arrows of insulting words from a materialistic-minded person exceeds the pain of an arrow which pierces the chest and enters into the heart. The pain caused by the insulting another living being enters the heart and becomes lodged there. The person continues to live with the pain of that insult lodged within his heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe quotes other verses from the Third Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam describing the characteristics of a prakrta-bhakta, or a materialistic devotee who is incapable of experiencing the suffering and happiness of others because he can think only of his own happiness and distress. Due to this mentality, he thinks nothing about causing pain to others, which is another sign of disrespect.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord is situated within the heart of all living beings. But because a materialistic devotee is incapable of seeing this, he sees everyone from an external viewpoint-- according to external designations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo due to this conditioning and bodily identification and generally also due to false pride, we cause pain to others. Of course, pain can be caused unknowingly, but we're speaking about pain which is caused knowingly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore it is said that one of the characteristics of a Vaisnava is that he sees others from the spiritual platform. And because he sees from the spiritual platform, he never willfully causes pain to any living entity and this is a sign of respect.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo as I said, because we have a tendency to identify with the body and the many false designations of the body, we interact with others on the social platform and we see others only according to external vision. But as spirit souls, parts and parcels of Krsna and servants of Krishna, we need to individually and collectively step out of those social roles and interact on a spiritual platform.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat is that interaction on a spiritual platform? Can anyone tell me?&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple: Six principles of association... dadati pratigrhnati.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS: Yes. That's true. But that's not what I'm looking for.&nbsp; Although it's true.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple: You said in the beginning that everyone is a servant. So we have to treat them...&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS: I'm looking for something that's actually very simple. How do we interact with each other on the spiritual platform?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSravanam/ kirtanam— hearing and chanting about Krsna. We have to hear and chant about Krsna together so that we don't get caught up in so&nbsp; many designations. The speaker speaks in service to Krsna for his own purification and the hearer hears in service to Krsna for his own purification. And we chant Hare Krsna together. That helps us become free from designations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsarvopadhi-vinirmuktam<br />\r\n\ttat-paratvena nirmalam<br />\r\n\thrsikena hrsikesa-<br />\r\n\tsevanam bhaktir ucyate<br />\r\n\t[BRS 1.1.12]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen one engages in devotional service in this way, with his mind and senses, automatically, what happens? Gradually he becomes free from identifying with his material designations. He sees himself as a servant of Krsna. And sees others as servants of Krsna. And when you see others as servants of Krsna, then respect becomes very natural.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs I said, however, there is also a hierarchy of respect for those who are servants of Krsna. Rupa Goswami has stated in Sri Upadesamrita the different levels of respect we should offer to those who are servants of Krsna.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor those who are chanting the holy name but their behavior may not be so perfect, we respect them from a distance. We offer our obeisances to them in our mind. But we respect them in the ways we just described. We don't criticize or insult them. We just respect them from a distance because we understand that if we get too close and become too confidential in our relationship with them, then our own Krsna consciousness may be adversely affected. But this never negates the need to offer respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe are supposed to respect all living entities. What to speak about those who are chanting Hare Krsna. There is no room for negating respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen Rupa Goswami says that for those who have taken Vaisnava initiation and who are faithfully engaged in the process of bhajana-kriya, rendering devotional service, we offer our obeisances directly to them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe topmost Vaisnavas, or those whose association we should always seek out, are those who have no propensity to criticize others. We should hear from them and faithfully serve them.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Rupa Goswami has given a spiritual hierarchy also—how to respect on the spiritual platform—for those who are engaged in sravanam/ kirtanam. But the only way we can come to that proper understanding is by engaging in sravanam/ kirtanam and by associating with those who are fully engaged in service to Krsna. Otherwise we'll remain on the external platform, in which case our tendency to disrespect will still remain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI tried to not make it too long. It's already 3:00. Is it clear?&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not very complicated. Respect is the symptom of a human being. We have to learn how to respect.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore Lord Caitanya says that in order to be able to continue to chant Hare Krsna we have to be able to offer all respect towards all living beings and to not expect it from others. That's the spiritual platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDid I answer the question?&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple: But in practice it's much more complicated, it's much more difficult because one has to practice humility and respect in one's activity or behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS: Yes. We have to act like a human being. A human being has to learn to discriminate between what's right and what's wrong. Therefore with his intelligence he has to learn how to control his mind and senses, beginning with the tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple: Does it mean that a person also respects himself, if it's an internal state?&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS: Respects himself? Well, as we said, a person doesn't expect respect from others towards himself. But one can respect himself when he understands, \"I'm a servant of Krsna and Krsna has given me a justification for my existence by giving me service, without which I have no&nbsp; such justification. But if Krsna very mercifully allows me to engage in His service, then immediately I have some value. But if I don't serve Him, what is my value? And how can I respect myself?\"&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Krsna gives everyone value by giving everyone an opportunity to serve Him. For those who are fortunate, they can serve Him by chanting Hare Krsna, by serving Vaisnavas, by hearing Srimad Bhagavatam… in so many ways we can serve. But immediately if we take advantage of the opportunity to serve Krsna in any of these ways, our life is given real value. We can consider ourselves very fortunate. Krsna has given us our value. Or, in our case, Krsna's devotee has given us value.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut if despite the opportunities to serve, I still don't take advantage, then how can I have any respect for myself? OK?&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnything else on this topic? I'm supposed the start the lecture at 3:00.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is a partially edited lecture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMarch 14, 2017 - Kiev - SB 5.25.13-15\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“There is no end to the great and glorious qualities of that powerful Lord Anantadeva. Indeed, His prowess is unlimited. Though self-sufficient, He Himself is the support of everything. He resides beneath the lower planetary systems and easily sustains the entire universe.”(SB 5.25.13)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“My dear King, as I heard of it from my spiritual master, I have fully described to you the creation of this material world according to the fruitive activities and desires of the conditioned souls. Those conditioned souls, who are full of material desires, achieve various situations in different planetary systems, and in this way they live within this material creation.” (SB 5.25.14)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this regard, srila Bhaktivinoda thakura sings,<br />\r\n\tanadi karama-phale, paḍi’ bhavarṇava-jale,<br />\r\n\ttaribare na dekhi upaya\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“My Lord, I do not know when I commenced my material life, but I can certainly experience that I have fallen in the deep ocean of nescience. Now I can also see that there is no other way to get out of it than to take shelter of Your lotus feet.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimilarly, sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu offers the following prayer,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram<br />\r\n\tpatitam mam visame bhavambudhau<br />\r\n\tkṛpaya tava pada-pankaja-<br />\r\n\tsthita-dhuli-sadṛsam vicintaya\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“My dear Lord, son of Nanda Maharaja, I am Your eternal servant. Somehow or other, I have fallen into this ocean of nescience. Kindly, therefore, save me from this horrible condition of materialistic life.” (Sri Siksastaka, verse 5)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“My dear King, I have thus described how people generally act according to their different desires and, as a result, get different types of bodies in higher or lower planets. You inquired of these things from me, and I have explained to you whatever I have heard from authorities. What shall I speak of now?”(SB 5.25.15)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis verse and commentary is summarizing that which has been previously described... how a living entity wanders in the material universe throughout different planetary systems and how the material universes have been formed to facilitate the movements of the living entities from the various higher to lower forms of life for the fulfilment of their fruitive desires.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is&nbsp; the purpose of the material creation... to give&nbsp; facility to a living entity to fulfill his fruitive desires.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada would oftentimes quote the verse,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tvisṇu-saktiḥ para prokta<br />\r\n\tksetra-jnakhya tatha para<br />\r\n\tavidya-karma-samjnanya<br />\r\n\ttṛtiya saktir isyate (Visṇu Puraṇa 6.7.61)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“There are three potencies of Krsna – the superior energy which is full of knowledge, the living entity who belongs to the superior energy, but although he belongs to that superior energy he can come under the influence to the third energy, which is ignorance and which is visible in fruitive activities.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis whole material nature has been designed for the living entity to pursue fruitive activities.&nbsp; It is a very effective design. Those who are intelligent enough to see the power of the illusory energy can understand that it is very powerful. It is designed in such a way to keep the living entity trapped according to his desires.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFruitive desire means desire for one’s own&nbsp; enjoyment. Therefore Krsna describes this in Bhagavad-gita as karma-bandhana. These desires are the cause of bondage of the living entity in the material world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are either fruitive desires or desires aimed for Lord’s pleasure. Those living entities whose desires are pure, exclusively for the Lord’s pleasure are not bound by the laws of fruitive activities or by material nature. Those who have independent desires are under the influence of the three modes of nature which, Krsna very clearly states, are very difficult to overcome.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhy is it difficult to overcome? Because the material nature or the illusory energy has two types of potencies – one is called avaranatmika-sakti, or the potency to keep the living entity feeling satisfied in this world, the other is called praksepatmika-sakti, which is the potency of the Lord that thrusts one down into the material world, even those who make an effort to get freed from it. One is thrust back down. And then one is rocked back and forth into deep sleep, or ignorance, again, thinking that the material world is not such a bad place.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore Krsna says that this material nature is very difficult to overcome. Until one can become free from fruitive desires, one’s status in life will be in the higher, middle or lower planetary system, accordingly-- the living entity is given a suitable body and a suitable facility to enact his fruitive desires.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe see that even great devotees of the Lord can come under the powerful influence of this illusory energy.&nbsp; The power of avaranatmika-sakti is perfectly displayed in the story about Indra oftentimes told from Mahabharata.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was looking through Vaktrtavali, a compilation of little stories from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. He tells the story about Indra when he was cursed to become a pig. He once lived at Manasa sarovara with his piglets.&nbsp; Brahma went there and said, “What are you doing here? You belong in heaven.” I am paraphrasing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut here Srila Bhaktisiddhanta says,<br />\r\n\t“'O, you! You go to heaven and&nbsp; sit on the throne of Indra. There, are many servants and maidservants who are waiting to serve you.' Hearing this, Indra was blinded by rage and tried to attack Brahma.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat was Brahma who was coming down and telling Indra, “What are you doing in this place? You may have been cursed but you don’t have to stay there. You have got a throne on the heavenly planets. You have so many people waiting to serve you. You have so much opulence and enjoyment. And here you are in stool!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAvaranatmika-sakti. He was thinking that stool was nice. Therefore he was actually opposed to Brahma who was trying to come and rescue him. He considered Brahma an enemy and out of anger and lamentation he became very restless.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur then continues,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Then one by one, Brahma killed Indra's piglets, and as a result, Indra in pig form screamed so loudly that the four directions shook. Then he killed his dear wife. Thereafter, bereft of his relatives, the pig-shaped Indra began to think about Brahma’s instruction and slowly remembered his actual position.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura’s commentary of that is,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“The pig understood, 'I am actually Indra. I am not a pig. The pig body is not my original form. By nature I am the servant of the Supreme Lord, serving as Indra.'\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs a result of hearing about one’s constitutional position the living beings can understand their actual identity. At present if we tell people mad after family life about their constitutional position, the way Mahaprabhu taught it, reminding them that they should give up all other activities and simply worship Lord Hari, then like the pig-shaped Indra, they too will reply, 'Eating stool, or in this case, material enjoyment, is our sanatana-dharma and we are happy with it. We do not want to hear about Lord Hari. We have so much work to do. We have to eat stool and we have to have more children.'\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuch people think that saints are their enemies. They do not know that:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tyasyaham anugrhnami<br />\r\n\tharisye tad-dhanam sanaih (SB 10.88.8)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“The Supreme Lord has said that to whomever He shows His mercy, He quickly takes away all that person’s possessions.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI decided to read it rather than paraphrase it so that everybody will understand that these are not my words. These are the words of the previous Acaryas, so that nobody comes and tries to attack me, “Why are you saying this? We do not want to hear these things.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI do not think anybody will do that. Hopefully, all of you present here understand that the material world is a place of suffering. If that realization is not there, it is very difficult to take to spiritual life, because as Srila Prabhupada states here in the commentary of the verse today, quoting Bhaktivinoda Thakura, “I do not know when I began my material life but I can certainly experience that I have fallen into a deep ocean of nescience.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen he quotes Lord Caitanya - ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram. “Somehow I have fallen into this ocean of nescience. Kindly save me from this horrible condition of materialistic life.” (siksastaka 5)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, in order to break free from this praksepatmika-sakti, one has to be convinced that this material place is no place for any gentleman. One has to at least admit,, “I'm suffering.”<br />\r\n\tIndra could not even realize that when he was a pig. He was so overwhelmed by the powerful illusory energy that he thought that being in the stool with his pig-wife and his little pig-children was a great place.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the power of the illusory energy because sometimes people suffer in the material world but they think, “Let me overcome suffering by fruitive activities.” It is not that people do not realize they are suffering. A lot of people get it, they understand, but they form different philosophies of life on how not to suffer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne philosophy of life is fruitive activities. The best way to avoid suffering is to enjoy. If I can make a nice arrangement to enjoy, then I can overcome my suffering condition. And if I can maintain hope that this nice arrangement I am making to enjoy will overcome my suffering condition, I am ready to accept whatever difficulties I have because at least I can have hope that I will not suffer like this anymore... And that gives me a sense of happiness. It is close enough, the enjoyment is close enough for me to realize that I can keep going until I get it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada gives the example on the way they keep the race horses running in a race. They put a little carrot in front of the horse’s nose. The horse thinks, “It's close! I know I’ll get it. It is close.” The horse is ready to run to any lengths to get that carrot. “It is there! I am almost there! I am almost there!” Fruitive activity does just that. Then we finally bite into the carrot and think, “Yay! I finally got it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe nature of fruitive activities is, as an intelligent person knows, it produces further suffering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido<br />\r\n\tna labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhaḥ<br />\r\n\ttal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham<br />\r\n\tkalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa (SB 1.5.18)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBhagavatam states that “persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined, do not endeavor for sense enjoyment which is available from the highest planets like Brahmaloka down to the lowest planets like Patala.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, they have enough brain substance to understand that the material world is a place of suffering. “It does not make any difference if I get some sense enjoyment; I know it is not going to be the permanent solution to my problems.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere it is. This is the definition what this universe is created for. The universe is created for sense enjoyment from the highest planet to the lowest planet. That is what is being stated here, “Thank you for telling me about what this universe has been created for – for fruitive activities to enjoy from the highest planet to the lowest planet.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese intelligent persons know that as far as this sense enjoyment is concerned, it comes automatically in due course of time, just as in due course of time suffering comes without asking for it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis universe is a complete whole. It is a system perfectly designed by perfect intelligence to keep those conditioned souls entrapped. It is such a perfect design. Avaranatmika-sakti and praksepatmika-sakti are perfectly designed. So many facilities to think “I can be satisfied here.” That is what makes it so hard to get out.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSomeone may say, “Why did Krsna make it so hard? It is His fault.” It is another challenge sometimes people come up with. “It is His fault, it is not my fault.” But actually the material universe was created as we just read in the verse.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“… I have fully described to you the creation of this material world according to the fruitive activities and desires of the conditioned souls. …” (SB 5.25.14)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is according to the desires of the conditioned souls. Someone may say, “Well, why am I allowed to have those desires? Krsna should not have allowed me to have those desires. It is His fault.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes people get so absorbed in whose fault it is. But here we read today Lord Caitanya says, “Somehow or other I have fallen.” Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, “I do not know when I commenced my material life but I can certainly experience that I have fallen in this deep ocean of nescience.” An intelligent person will try to understand. “I am suffering.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada gives the example when a house is burning down, you do not run and ask, “Who lit the fire?” The house is burning down. You run downstairs, knock on the door and ask, “Who lit the fire?” “What difference does it make? The house is on fire.” “I need to know who lit the fire.” “What do you need to know who lit the fire for? It is burning down.” “At least if I know who lit the fire, I will be careful not to be in a house that's burning down again.” Meanwhile the house is burning down and we get into all these arguments about who lit the fire. It is very difficult to understand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI oftentimes refer to this quote of Bhaktivinoda Thakura. It is one of my favorite quotes for mental speculators who think that unless they can pierce the covering of the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Lord and fully understand it with their intelligence; they will not surrender to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey think, “I have to first understand everything. And only when I can understand everything with my powerful, powerful intelligence. My powerful intelligence will reveal everything to me. Then I will be able to reduce this entire cosmic manifestation to one little simple formula.” Although Krsna can never be reduced to one little simple formula – He is inconceivable, and one has to accept that if one wants to get out of this material world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnless one accepts the inconceivable potencies of the Lord, he will never be able to get out of maya. With our puny little brains we try to reduce Krsna to someone who we can so fully understand that we can predict everything.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Krsna always has the upper hand. That's what makes Him different from us. He is God and we are not.<br />\r\n\tekale isvara kṛsṇa, ara saba bhṛtya<br />\r\n\tyare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nṛtya (CC Adi 5.142)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna is the Supreme and all living entities are subordinate to Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t‘mayadhisa' ‘maya-vasa' -- isvare-jive bheda as described in Caitanya Caritamrita. Krsna is mayadhisa, which means He is the controller of maya. And living entities are maya-vasa; they are under the control of maya. Krsna says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tmayadhyaksena prakrtih<br />\r\n\tsuyate sa-caracaram (B-g 9.10)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaya works under My direction. These things living entities can understand by hearing from a superior source but Krsna’s powers and potencies are always inconceivable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust like the story of Lord Brahma. There are so many stories about Lord Brahma, like Brahma vimohana-lila. In Brahma-vimohana-lila he tried to play a trick on Krsna but Krsna had to show him that He has the upper hand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Do you think you can play a trick on Me and steal all my cowherd boys and cows? I have the upper hand. I will become all the cowherd boys and cows. Why have you taken them away?”<br />\r\n\tThen Brahma comes back and sees all the cows and cowherd boys. Then Krsna reveals His four-armed form to Brahma and all the cowherd boys and cows are Him. And Brahma says, “Oh, forgive me. I can never fully understand Your glories.” Brahma offered his prayers to the Lord. “Forgive me. I tried to reduce You to a little formula and You showed me that it's not possible.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Brahma went to see the Lord, the gate-keeper came and Brahma said, “I have come to see the Lord.” Then the gate-keeper went in and said, “Brahma wants to see You.” The gate-keeper goes back to Lord Brahma because the Lord asked the gate-keeper to ask him, “Which Brahma is it?” So he goes back to Brahma and says, “The Lord wants to know which Brahma is here.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Which Brahma? It is Brahma. He knows who I am. I am Brahma with four heads.” Brahma thought he was the original creator of the universe. “He should know who I am.” That is power of the Lord’s energy that one thinks oneself to be important. Then Krsna has to reveal His inconceivable potencies for those who may temporarily forget.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Brahma was allowed in and the Lord said, “You asked which Brahma you are.” Then all of a sudden all the other Brahmas were called by the Lord – Brahmas with eight heads, sixteen heads, thirty-two heads, sixty-four heads, millions of heads. Then Brahma felt like a little insignificant insect in presence of all these other Brahmas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe inconceivable potencies of the Lord have to be accepted. The difference between a devotee and empiricists is that they cannot accept submission to the inconceivable potencies of the Lord. But when a devotee sees the inconceivable potencies of the Lord, he thinks how wonderful Krsna is. “Krsna is so wonderful.” That is the difference between a devotee and an empiricist – a devotee accepts that Krsna is so wonderfully inconceivable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“The more I hear about Him, the more I want to serve Him.” The more one wants to serve Him, the more Krsna becomes satisfied with the devotee’s desire to serve Him that He reveals more and more of His inconceivable nature into the heart of that devotee, because a devotee always wants to serve the Lord. He does not look for excuses not to serve the Lord. He knows that under all circumstances the Lord is worthy of my service now and forever. He is happy to hear the inconceivable pastimes of the Lord, because the more he hears about the inconceivable pastimes of the Lord, the more his love for the Lord increases. The more he remembers the Lord, the more he desires to serve the Lord and the more he becomes qualified to become an eternal associate of the Lord. By the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Lord, even that which is inconceivable can be understood. Even that which is inconceivable can be understood if one accepts the inconceivable potencies of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-<br />\r\n\tprasada-lesanugṛhita eva hi<br />\r\n\tjanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno<br />\r\n\tna canya eko ’pi ciram vicinvan (SB 10.14.29)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Brahma said this. He said that after Brahma-vimohana-lila. “Unless one gets a drop of mercy from Your lotus feet, one can never understand Your inconceivable greatness.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat is what Brahma got when he tried to fool the Lord, and the Lord revealed His inconceivable nature. That was his realization. “Unless one gets a drop of mercy from Your lotus feet, one will never be able to understand Your inconceivable pastimes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn those same prayers Brahma says to the Lord, “Those who are accustomed to speculate about You are like persons who beat the empty husk of rice to get grain. They do not get Your mercy but they do get something. They get their hard labor”... because if they beat the empty husk of rice to get grain, there is no rice in there. It is empty.&nbsp; But they keep on beating. They get something – their hard labor, but no rice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBrahma says that in the same prayers in Brahma-vimohana-lila when he is praying to the Lord. That is what he says to Krsna. “We need Your mercy. Somehow or other I simply want to be qualified for Your mercy.” That is what Brahma also said in the same prayers. He said to the Lord, “O my Lord, please count me as one of Your devotees. Let me take birth as Brahma in any planet. Wherever I go, it does not make any difference. Just look at me and count me as one of Your devotees.” That was his prayer, the same prayer after Brahma-vimohana-lila. That is all he wanted. Just please accept me as somebody who wants to serve You. That is a devotee. He is happy to know that the Lord is inconceivable, and he never blames the Lord for his suffering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttat te 'nukampam susamiksamaṇo<br />\r\n\tbhunjana evatma-kṛtam vipakam<br />\r\n\thṛd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te<br />\r\n\tjiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak&nbsp; (SB 10.14.8)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat is also described in the prayers in Srimad Bhagavatam. “One who seeks Your compassion and tolerates all kinds of adverse suffering due to one’s own past misdeeds, who goes on serving You with his body, mind and words, certainly he becomes a bona fide candidate for Krsna’s mercy.” He does not blame Krsna, “Oh, why did You always let me suffer?! It is Your fault. I cannot surrender until I know why Krsna did this.”<br />\r\n\tNow I am going to go back to Bhaktivinoda Thakura. This is all an introduction to Bhaktivinoda Thakura. I did not forget. I am going to read it. I am probably going to end with it. This is Sri Bhaktyaloka.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“The Amnaya says that the living entities are minute particles of the spiritual sun, Krsna, and they are innumerable. As the spiritual world is manifested by Krsna’s cit, or spiritual potency, and as the material world is manifested by the inferior illusory energy, similarly the living entities are manifested by a portion of the spiritual energy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tvisṇu-saktiḥ para prokta<br />\r\n\tksetra-jnakhya tatha para<br />\r\n\tavidya-karma-samjnanya<br />\r\n\ttṛtiya saktir isyate (Visṇu Puraṇa 6.7.61)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is actually the three potencies of the Lord (we quoted it right in the very beginning) –&nbsp; the superior, the inferior and living entities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Krsna’s spiritual form has all qualities in full. And those qualities are naturally present in the living entities in minute quantity.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna’s qualities are unlimited and are manifested in minute particles but in a limited way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“The independent nature of Krsna is found insignificantly in the living entities.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna is supremely independent. We are minutely independent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Why? Why am I minutely independent? Why did He let me be independent?”<br />\r\n\t“Because we are part and parcel of Krsna. Krsna is unlimitedly independent. We are minutely independent.”<br />\r\n\t“I do not want to be minutely independent.”<br />\r\n\t“Oh, you do not want to be minutely independent? So, that means you want to be dependent, huh?”<br />\r\n\t“No, I am not ready to be dependent. But I do not want to be minutely independent either.”<br />\r\n\t“Oh, that means you don’t want to exist, right?”<br />\r\n\t“Maybe that’s what I am saying.”<br />\r\n\t“Sorry, you exist. And nothing is going to change.”<br />\r\n\t“I don’t want to be dependent, I don’t want to be minutely independent either.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnyway, let’s continue.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“The independent nature of Krsna insignificantly found in living beings. For this reason the living entities claim to be independent. As a result all living entities have developed different propensities. By one propensity the living entity searches for his own happiness.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFruitive activities... karma... avidya karma samjnana... from to topmost planets lowest planets.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“By one propensity the living entity searches for his own happiness. By another propensity he searches for Krsna’s happiness. Thus living entities are divided into two groups – those searching for their own happiness and those searching for Krsna’s happiness. Those who search for Krsna’s happiness are called nitya-mukta and those who search for their own happiness are called nitya-baddha. In this regard all inconceivable natures are under the subordination of spiritual time.”<br />\r\n\t“In this regard all these inconceivable nature are subordinate to spiritual time.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose who are still trapped in the material world cannot understand it.&nbsp; Think of something that has no beginning …\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGo ahead! Start! Let me know when you are finished. At some point you have to accept Krsna has no beginning. But if you try to get there by using&nbsp; the limited mind, you cannot get there, because everything in our experience has a beginning.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSomebody may say, “Krsna has created the material world. It has a beginning.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWell, that’s what you think, but the material world has always existed. And its creation and annihilation has been going on eternally, because Krsna’s energies are eternal. Not only Krsna is eternal but His energies are eternal. His energies have no beginning because Krsna has no beginning also. Just as you cannot conceive of somebody who has no beginning, His energies also have no beginning.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“You mean to tell me that there was never the time when Krsna created His energies!?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere we go.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey have no beginning. They are always eternally manifest or unmanifest. And the complete understanding of the Supreme Being cannot be understood unless one accepts that Krsna and His energies exist simultaneously. One has to accept it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNever was there a time when they are not created. Krsna says to Arjuna that “Never was there a time when I did not exist. Never was there a time you did not exist. You see all the kings assembled here on the battlefield. Never was there a time they did not exist. Nor in the future will any of us ever cease to be.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGo ahead, start, and think about it! Let me know when you finish. We are still trapped by time.<br />\r\n\tI am explaining this to help you understand what Bhaktivinoda Thakura is about to say. Because when I finish reading this, this class is over. I want to make sure when I finish reading this, you have the greatest opportunity to accept it. Not that you are going to jump up and say, “Wait a minute! I have to ask this question. You cannot go now.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccept it. Just accept it. That’s my humble appeal. It will carry you a long way if you just accept it. Let us continue.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“In this regard all inconceivable natures are under the subordination of spiritual time. The time factor of the spiritual nature is a state of eternal present. But in the inferior illusory energy there are three states of existence – past, present and future.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Spiritual time – eternal present, material time – past, present and future; creation, maintenance, destruction. But what was created first? Time because without time there can be no creation, maintenance and destruction. First time is created.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“When was time created?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Accept my dear prabhu.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Whatever considerations arise in this regard if related with the spiritual time factor,&nbsp; then no doubts will remain; but if seen otherwise, then doubts will remain. Why did a pure spirit soul search for his own happiness? If one puts forward such a question, then doubt arising from material time factor will manifest. If one can give up such doubts, then he can perform devotional service, otherwise there will only be a series of arguments. If arguments are related to inconceivable nature, then anarthas arise.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEnd of quote, end of class. Hare Krsna.

Indeed, His prowess is unlimited. Though self-sufficient, He Himself is the support of everything. He resides beneath the lower planetary systems and easily sustains the entire universe.”(SB 5.25.13)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“My dear King, as I heard of it from my spiritual master, I have fully described to you the creation of this material world according to the fruitive activities and desires of the conditioned souls. Those conditioned souls, who are full of material desires, achieve various situations in different planetary systems, and in this way they live within this material creation.” (SB 5.25.14)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this regard, srila Bhaktivinoda thakura sings,<br />\n\tanadi karama-phale, paḍi’ bhavarṇava-jale,<br />\n\ttaribare na dekhi upaya\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“My Lord, I do not know when I commenced my material life, but I can certainly experience that I have fallen in the deep ocean of nescience. Now I can also see that there is no other way to get out of it than to take shelter of Your lotus feet.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu offers the following prayer,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram<br />\n\tpatitam mam visame bhavambudhau<br />\n\tkṛpaya tava pada-pankaja-<br />\n\tsthita-dhuli-sadṛsam vicintaya\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“My dear Lord, son of Nanda Maharaja, I am Your eternal servant. Somehow or other, I have fallen into this ocean of nescience. Kindly, therefore, save me from this horrible condition of materialistic life.” (Sri Siksastaka, verse 5)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“My dear King, I have thus described how people generally act according to their different desires and, as a result, get different types of bodies in higher or lower planets. You inquired of these things from me, and I have explained to you whatever I have heard from authorities. What shall I speak of now?”(SB 5.25.15)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis verse and commentary is summarizing that which has been previously described... how a living entity wanders in the material universe throughout different planetary systems and how the material universes have been formed to facilitate the movements of the living entities from the various higher to lower forms of life for the fulfilment of their fruitive desires.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is  the purpose of the material creation... to give  facility to a living entity to fulfill his fruitive desires.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada would oftentimes quote the verse,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tvisṇu-saktiḥ para prokta<br />\n\tksetra-jnakhya tatha para<br />\n\tavidya-karma-samjnanya<br />\n\ttṛtiya saktir isyate (Visṇu Puraṇa 6.7.61)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“There are three potencies of Krsna – the superior energy which is full of knowledge, the living entity who belongs to the superior energy, but although he belongs to that superior energy he can come under the influence to the third energy, which is ignorance and which is visible in fruitive activities.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis whole material nature has been designed for the living entity to pursue fruitive activities.  It is a very effective design. Those who are intelligent enough to see the power of the illusory energy can understand that it is very powerful. It is designed in such a way to keep the living entity trapped according to his desires.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFruitive desire means desire for one’s own  enjoyment. Therefore Krsna describes this in Bhagavad-gita as karma-bandhana. These desires are the cause of bondage of the living entity in the material world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are either fruitive desires or desires aimed for Lord’s pleasure. Those living entities whose desires are pure, exclusively for the Lord’s pleasure are not bound by the laws of fruitive activities or by material nature. Those who have independent desires are under the influence of the three modes of nature which, Krsna very clearly states, are very difficult to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy is it difficult to overcome? Because the material nature or the illusory energy has two types of potencies – one is called avaranatmika-sakti, or the potency to keep the living entity feeling satisfied in this world, the other is called praksepatmika-sakti, which is the potency of the Lord that thrusts one down into the material world, even those who make an effort to get freed from it. One is thrust back down. And then one is rocked back and forth into deep sleep, or ignorance, again, thinking that the material world is not such a bad place.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore Krsna says that this material nature is very difficult to overcome. Until one can become free from fruitive desires, one’s status in life will be in the higher, middle or lower planetary system, accordingly-- the living entity is given a suitable body and a suitable facility to enact his fruitive desires.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe see that even great devotees of the Lord can come under the powerful influence of this illusory energy.  The power of avaranatmika-sakti is perfectly displayed in the story about Indra oftentimes told from Mahabharata.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was looking through Vaktrtavali, a compilation of little stories from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. He tells the story about Indra when he was cursed to become a pig. He once lived at Manasa sarovara with his piglets.  Brahma went there and said, “What are you doing here? You belong in heaven.” I am paraphrasing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut here Srila Bhaktisiddhanta says,<br />\n\t“'O, you! You go to heaven and  sit on the throne of Indra. There, are many servants and maidservants who are waiting to serve you.' Hearing this, Indra was blinded by rage and tried to attack Brahma.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat was Brahma who was coming down and telling Indra, “What are you doing in this place? You may have been cursed but you don’t have to stay there. You have got a throne on the heavenly planets. You have so many people waiting to serve you. You have so much opulence and enjoyment. And here you are in stool!”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAvaranatmika-sakti. He was thinking that stool was nice. Therefore he was actually opposed to Brahma who was trying to come and rescue him. He considered Brahma an enemy and out of anger and lamentation he became very restless.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur then continues,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Then one by one, Brahma killed Indra's piglets, and as a result, Indra in pig form screamed so loudly that the four directions shook. Then he killed his dear wife. Thereafter, bereft of his relatives, the pig-shaped Indra began to think about Brahma’s instruction and slowly remembered his actual position.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura’s commentary of that is,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The pig understood, 'I am actually Indra. I am not a pig. The pig body is not my original form. By nature I am the servant of the Supreme Lord, serving as Indra.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a result of hearing about one’s constitutional position the living beings can understand their actual identity. At present if we tell people mad after family life about their constitutional position, the way Mahaprabhu taught it, reminding them that they should give up all other activities and simply worship Lord Hari, then like the pig-shaped Indra, they too will reply, 'Eating stool, or in this case, material enjoyment, is our sanatana-dharma and we are happy with it. We do not want to hear about Lord Hari. We have so much work to do. We have to eat stool and we have to have more children.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSuch people think that saints are their enemies. They do not know that:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tyasyaham anugrhnami<br />\n\tharisye tad-dhanam sanaih (SB 10.88.8)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Supreme Lord has said that to whomever He shows His mercy, He quickly takes away all that person’s possessions.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI decided to read it rather than paraphrase it so that everybody will understand that these are not my words. These are the words of the previous Acaryas, so that nobody comes and tries to attack me, “Why are you saying this? We do not want to hear these things.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI do not think anybody will do that. Hopefully, all of you present here understand that the material world is a place of suffering. If that realization is not there, it is very difficult to take to spiritual life, because as Srila Prabhupada states here in the commentary of the verse today, quoting Bhaktivinoda Thakura, “I do not know when I began my material life but I can certainly experience that I have fallen into a deep ocean of nescience.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen he quotes Lord Caitanya - ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram. “Somehow I have fallen into this ocean of nescience. Kindly save me from this horrible condition of materialistic life.” (siksastaka 5)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, in order to break free from this praksepatmika-sakti, one has to be convinced that this material place is no place for any gentleman. One has to at least admit,, “I'm suffering.”<br />\n\tIndra could not even realize that when he was a pig. He was so overwhelmed by the powerful illusory energy that he thought that being in the stool with his pig-wife and his little pig-children was a great place.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the power of the illusory energy because sometimes people suffer in the material world but they think, “Let me overcome suffering by fruitive activities.” It is not that people do not realize they are suffering. A lot of people get it, they understand, but they form different philosophies of life on how not to suffer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne philosophy of life is fruitive activities. The best way to avoid suffering is to enjoy. If I can make a nice arrangement to enjoy, then I can overcome my suffering condition. And if I can maintain hope that this nice arrangement I am making to enjoy will overcome my suffering condition, I am ready to accept whatever difficulties I have because at least I can have hope that I will not suffer like this anymore... And that gives me a sense of happiness. It is close enough, the enjoyment is close enough for me to realize that I can keep going until I get it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada gives the example on the way they keep the race horses running in a race. They put a little carrot in front of the horse’s nose. The horse thinks, “It's close! I know I’ll get it. It is close.” The horse is ready to run to any lengths to get that carrot. “It is there! I am almost there! I am almost there!” Fruitive activity does just that. Then we finally bite into the carrot and think, “Yay! I finally got it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe nature of fruitive activities is, as an intelligent person knows, it produces further suffering.\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido<br />\n\tna labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhaḥ<br />\n\ttal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham<br />\n\tkalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa (SB 1.5.18)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBhagavatam states that “persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined, do not endeavor for sense enjoyment which is available from the highest planets like Brahmaloka down to the lowest planets like Patala.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, they have enough brain substance to understand that the material world is a place of suffering. “It does not make any difference if I get some sense enjoyment; I know it is not going to be the permanent solution to my problems.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere it is. This is the definition what this universe is created for. The universe is created for sense enjoyment from the highest planet to the lowest planet. That is what is being stated here, “Thank you for telling me about what this universe has been created for – for fruitive activities to enjoy from the highest planet to the lowest planet.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese intelligent persons know that as far as this sense enjoyment is concerned, it comes automatically in due course of time, just as in due course of time suffering comes without asking for it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis universe is a complete whole. It is a system perfectly designed by perfect intelligence to keep those conditioned souls entrapped. It is such a perfect design. Avaranatmika-sakti and praksepatmika-sakti are perfectly designed. So many facilities to think “I can be satisfied here.” That is what makes it so hard to get out.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSomeone may say, “Why did Krsna make it so hard? It is His fault.” It is another challenge sometimes people come up with. “It is His fault, it is not my fault.” But actually the material universe was created as we just read in the verse.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“… I have fully described to you the creation of this material world according to the fruitive activities and desires of the conditioned souls. …” (SB 5.25.14)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is according to the desires of the conditioned souls. Someone may say, “Well, why am I allowed to have those desires? Krsna should not have allowed me to have those desires. It is His fault.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes people get so absorbed in whose fault it is. But here we read today Lord Caitanya says, “Somehow or other I have fallen.” Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, “I do not know when I commenced my material life but I can certainly experience that I have fallen in this deep ocean of nescience.” An intelligent person will try to understand. “I am suffering.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada gives the example when a house is burning down, you do not run and ask, “Who lit the fire?” The house is burning down. You run downstairs, knock on the door and ask, “Who lit the fire?” “What difference does it make? The house is on fire.” “I need to know who lit the fire.” “What do you need to know who lit the fire for? It is burning down.” “At least if I know who lit the fire, I will be careful not to be in a house that's burning down again.” Meanwhile the house is burning down and we get into all these arguments about who lit the fire. It is very difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI oftentimes refer to this quote of Bhaktivinoda Thakura. It is one of my favorite quotes for mental speculators who think that unless they can pierce the covering of the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Lord and fully understand it with their intelligence; they will not surrender to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThey think, “I have to first understand everything. And only when I can understand everything with my powerful, powerful intelligence. My powerful intelligence will reveal everything to me. Then I will be able to reduce this entire cosmic manifestation to one little simple formula.” Although Krsna can never be reduced to one little simple formula – He is inconceivable, and one has to accept that if one wants to get out of this material world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUnless one accepts the inconceivable potencies of the Lord, he will never be able to get out of maya. With our puny little brains we try to reduce Krsna to someone who we can so fully understand that we can predict everything.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Krsna always has the upper hand. That's what makes Him different from us. He is God and we are not.<br />\n\tekale isvara kṛsṇa, ara saba bhṛtya<br />\n\tyare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nṛtya (CC Adi 5.142)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna is the Supreme and all living entities are subordinate to Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t‘mayadhisa' ‘maya-vasa' -- isvare-jive bheda as described in Caitanya Caritamrita. Krsna is mayadhisa, which means He is the controller of maya. And living entities are maya-vasa; they are under the control of maya. Krsna says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tmayadhyaksena prakrtih<br />\n\tsuyate sa-caracaram (B-g 9.10)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMaya works under My direction. These things living entities can understand by hearing from a superior source but Krsna’s powers and potencies are always inconceivable.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJust like the story of Lord Brahma. There are so many stories about Lord Brahma, like Brahma vimohana-lila. In Brahma-vimohana-lila he tried to play a trick on Krsna but Krsna had to show him that He has the upper hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Do you think you can play a trick on Me and steal all my cowherd boys and cows? I have the upper hand. I will become all the cowherd boys and cows. Why have you taken them away?”<br />\n\tThen Brahma comes back and sees all the cows and cowherd boys. Then Krsna reveals His four-armed form to Brahma and all the cowherd boys and cows are Him. And Brahma says, “Oh, forgive me. I can never fully understand Your glories.” Brahma offered his prayers to the Lord. “Forgive me. I tried to reduce You to a little formula and You showed me that it's not possible.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Brahma went to see the Lord, the gate-keeper came and Brahma said, “I have come to see the Lord.” Then the gate-keeper went in and said, “Brahma wants to see You.” The gate-keeper goes back to Lord Brahma because the Lord asked the gate-keeper to ask him, “Which Brahma is it?” So he goes back to Brahma and says, “The Lord wants to know which Brahma is here.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Which Brahma? It is Brahma. He knows who I am. I am Brahma with four heads.” Brahma thought he was the original creator of the universe. “He should know who I am.” That is power of the Lord’s energy that one thinks oneself to be important. Then Krsna has to reveal His inconceivable potencies for those who may temporarily forget.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Brahma was allowed in and the Lord said, “You asked which Brahma you are.” Then all of a sudden all the other Brahmas were called by the Lord – Brahmas with eight heads, sixteen heads, thirty-two heads, sixty-four heads, millions of heads. Then Brahma felt like a little insignificant insect in presence of all these other Brahmas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe inconceivable potencies of the Lord have to be accepted. The difference between a devotee and empiricists is that they cannot accept submission to the inconceivable potencies of the Lord. But when a devotee sees the inconceivable potencies of the Lord, he thinks how wonderful Krsna is. “Krsna is so wonderful.” That is the difference between a devotee and an empiricist – a devotee accepts that Krsna is so wonderfully inconceivable.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The more I hear about Him, the more I want to serve Him.” The more one wants to serve Him, the more Krsna becomes satisfied with the devotee’s desire to serve Him that He reveals more and more of His inconceivable nature into the heart of that devotee, because a devotee always wants to serve the Lord. He does not look for excuses not to serve the Lord. He knows that under all circumstances the Lord is worthy of my service now and forever. He is happy to hear the inconceivable pastimes of the Lord, because the more he hears about the inconceivable pastimes of the Lord, the more his love for the Lord increases. The more he remembers the Lord, the more he desires to serve the Lord and the more he becomes qualified to become an eternal associate of the Lord. By the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Lord, even that which is inconceivable can be understood. Even that which is inconceivable can be understood if one accepts the inconceivable potencies of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-<br />\n\tprasada-lesanugṛhita eva hi<br />\n\tjanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno<br />\n\tna canya eko ’pi ciram vicinvan (SB 10.14.29)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Brahma said this. He said that after Brahma-vimohana-lila. “Unless one gets a drop of mercy from Your lotus feet, one can never understand Your inconceivable greatness.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is what Brahma got when he tried to fool the Lord, and the Lord revealed His inconceivable nature. That was his realization. “Unless one gets a drop of mercy from Your lotus feet, one will never be able to understand Your inconceivable pastimes.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn those same prayers Brahma says to the Lord, “Those who are accustomed to speculate about You are like persons who beat the empty husk of rice to get grain. They do not get Your mercy but they do get something. They get their hard labor”... because if they beat the empty husk of rice to get grain, there is no rice in there. It is empty.  But they keep on beating. They get something – their hard labor, but no rice.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBrahma says that in the same prayers in Brahma-vimohana-lila when he is praying to the Lord. That is what he says to Krsna. “We need Your mercy. Somehow or other I simply want to be qualified for Your mercy.” That is what Brahma also said in the same prayers. He said to the Lord, “O my Lord, please count me as one of Your devotees. Let me take birth as Brahma in any planet. Wherever I go, it does not make any difference. Just look at me and count me as one of Your devotees.” That was his prayer, the same prayer after Brahma-vimohana-lila. That is all he wanted. Just please accept me as somebody who wants to serve You. That is a devotee. He is happy to know that the Lord is inconceivable, and he never blames the Lord for his suffering.\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttat te 'nukampam susamiksamaṇo<br />\n\tbhunjana evatma-kṛtam vipakam<br />\n\thṛd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te<br />\n\tjiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak  (SB 10.14.8)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThat is also described in the prayers in Srimad Bhagavatam. “One who seeks Your compassion and tolerates all kinds of adverse suffering due to one’s own past misdeeds, who goes on serving You with his body, mind and words, certainly he becomes a bona fide candidate for Krsna’s mercy.” He does not blame Krsna, “Oh, why did You always let me suffer?! It is Your fault. I cannot surrender until I know why Krsna did this.”<br />\n\tNow I am going to go back to Bhaktivinoda Thakura. This is all an introduction to Bhaktivinoda Thakura. I did not forget. I am going to read it. I am probably going to end with it. This is Sri Bhaktyaloka.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Amnaya says that the living entities are minute particles of the spiritual sun, Krsna, and they are innumerable. As the spiritual world is manifested by Krsna’s cit, or spiritual potency, and as the material world is manifested by the inferior illusory energy, similarly the living entities are manifested by a portion of the spiritual energy.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tvisṇu-saktiḥ para prokta<br />\n\tksetra-jnakhya tatha para<br />\n\tavidya-karma-samjnanya<br />\n\ttṛtiya saktir isyate (Visṇu Puraṇa 6.7.61)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is actually the three potencies of the Lord (we quoted it right in the very beginning) –  the superior, the inferior and living entities.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Krsna’s spiritual form has all qualities in full. And those qualities are naturally present in the living entities in minute quantity.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna’s qualities are unlimited and are manifested in minute particles but in a limited way.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The independent nature of Krsna is found insignificantly in the living entities.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna is supremely independent. We are minutely independent.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Why? Why am I minutely independent? Why did He let me be independent?”<br />\n\t“Because we are part and parcel of Krsna. Krsna is unlimitedly independent. We are minutely independent.”<br />\n\t“I do not want to be minutely independent.”<br />\n\t“Oh, you do not want to be minutely independent? So, that means you want to be dependent, huh?”<br />\n\t“No, I am not ready to be dependent. But I do not want to be minutely independent either.”<br />\n\t“Oh, that means you don’t want to exist, right?”<br />\n\t“Maybe that’s what I am saying.”<br />\n\t“Sorry, you exist. And nothing is going to change.”<br />\n\t“I don’t want to be dependent, I don’t want to be minutely independent either.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyway, let’s continue.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The independent nature of Krsna insignificantly found in living beings. For this reason the living entities claim to be independent. As a result all living entities have developed different propensities. By one propensity the living entity searches for his own happiness.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFruitive activities... karma... avidya karma samjnana... from to topmost planets lowest planets.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“By one propensity the living entity searches for his own happiness. By another propensity he searches for Krsna’s happiness. Thus living entities are divided into two groups – those searching for their own happiness and those searching for Krsna’s happiness. Those who search for Krsna’s happiness are called nitya-mukta and those who search for their own happiness are called nitya-baddha. In this regard all inconceivable natures are under the subordination of spiritual time.”<br />\n\t“In this regard all these inconceivable nature are subordinate to spiritual time.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThose who are still trapped in the material world cannot understand it.  Think of something that has no beginning …\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead! Start! Let me know when you are finished. At some point you have to accept Krsna has no beginning. But if you try to get there by using  the limited mind, you cannot get there, because everything in our experience has a beginning.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSomebody may say, “Krsna has created the material world. It has a beginning.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, that’s what you think, but the material world has always existed. And its creation and annihilation has been going on eternally, because Krsna’s energies are eternal. Not only Krsna is eternal but His energies are eternal. His energies have no beginning because Krsna has no beginning also. Just as you cannot conceive of somebody who has no beginning, His energies also have no beginning.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“You mean to tell me that there was never the time when Krsna created His energies!?”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHere we go.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThey have no beginning. They are always eternally manifest or unmanifest. And the complete understanding of the Supreme Being cannot be understood unless one accepts that Krsna and His energies exist simultaneously. One has to accept it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNever was there a time when they are not created. Krsna says to Arjuna that “Never was there a time when I did not exist. Never was there a time you did not exist. You see all the kings assembled here on the battlefield. Never was there a time they did not exist. Nor in the future will any of us ever cease to be.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead, start, and think about it! Let me know when you finish. We are still trapped by time.<br />\n\tI am explaining this to help you understand what Bhaktivinoda Thakura is about to say. Because when I finish reading this, this class is over. I want to make sure when I finish reading this, you have the greatest opportunity to accept it. Not that you are going to jump up and say, “Wait a minute! I have to ask this question. You cannot go now.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAccept it. Just accept it. That’s my humble appeal. It will carry you a long way if you just accept it. Let us continue.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“In this regard all inconceivable natures are under the subordination of spiritual time. The time factor of the spiritual nature is a state of eternal present. But in the inferior illusory energy there are three states of existence – past, present and future.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Spiritual time – eternal present, material time – past, present and future; creation, maintenance, destruction. But what was created first? Time because without time there can be no creation, maintenance and destruction. First time is created.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“When was time created?”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Accept my dear prabhu.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Whatever considerations arise in this regard if related with the spiritual time factor,  then no doubts will remain; but if seen otherwise, then doubts will remain. Why did a pure spirit soul search for his own happiness? If one puts forward such a question, then doubt arising from material time factor will manifest. If one can give up such doubts, then he can perform devotional service, otherwise there will only be a series of arguments. If arguments are related to inconceivable nature, then anarthas arise.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEnd of quote, end of class. Hare Krsna. All glories to Srila Prabhupada and our previous Acaryas.\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tIt all started on April 25th. I left Trai Prabhu's home in the outskirts of Bologna, expecting to catch a 12:20 PM flight to Vienna and then a connecting flight to Moscow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI had come down with a very bad cold that day, an event which, unknown to me then, would contribute to the title of this blog. Being concerned how I would tolerate the flight with such a bad cold, I filled myself up with antihistamine, hoping that it would carry me through the long day of travel and that it would also minimize the risk of an ear canal inflammation, something which is always a risk when flying with a bad cold.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn Moscow my plan was to take an intensive treatment for my back until the third week of May. My back has been progressively getting worse for the past several months.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout going into too much detail, I will simply say that this planned treatment was an attempt to do my part to avoid a reoccurrence of back problems similar to those which sidelined me for many months about seven or eight years ago.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout 1-2 kilometers from Trai Prabhu's home, the tire on the car taking me to Bologna Airport went completely flat. There was no spare tire and it was a holiday in Italy. There was no way to get a quick repair. To avoid missing the flight, we called Trai Prabhu, who promptly came in his car to drive me to the airport.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFortunately I arrived at the airport within more than enough time to check in and catch my flight. Unfortunately, however, while checking in I discovered that my Russian visa, though still valid in my old passport was unacceptable unless it was transferred into my new passport. I did not expect this.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust two months earlier, my valid Indian visa in my old passport, when provided along with my new passport, was accepted without issue for entering India. Moreover, I had been told from reliable sources, that this is a standard procedure… to show the still-valid visa in the old passport along with the new passport. Apparently this is not so for entering Russia.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn and of itself, this did not seem like that much of a problem. I therefore attempted to cancel my flight before it departed, to rebook my flight for either the next day or the day after, and to then find the closest Russian Embassy where I could transfer my visa from my old passport to my new passport.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI discovered, however, that not only was my ticket non-refundable, which meant that within the next hour I would lose my ticket to Moscow, but that the nearest Russian Embassy was in Milan, they were closed the next day, and they would answer queries only in the embassy and only after booking an appointment with them online. In other words, there was no way I could even find out if I could get my visa transferred in Milan until I drove there for a pre-scheduled appointment. It sounded too risky for me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI contacted Madana-mohana dasa and asked him to inquire whether or not I could get my visa transferred into my new passport in India. He then contacted a Russian consulate in India. He was told that for a small fee it could be done.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was then and there, while still sitting in the Bologna Airport, that I decided to fly to Delhi through Moscow. The first flight would be a direct flight from Bologna to Moscow, leaving shortly after midnight on the 27th morning. Both Trai Prabhu and Bhaktin Felicia, a local devotee who had accompanied both of us to the airport, were of the opinion that the cancelled flight was Krsna's arrangement for me to recuperate in Bologna from my bad cold before spending time in an airplane. I now had an extra day and a half to recover, and honestly speaking, with the way I was feeling, I couldn't help but fully agree with them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter an additional day and a half with Trai Prabhu, although rested, my condition was worsening into something I've encountered before from the effects of a bad cold. It was slowly moving into my lungs. Still, not wanting to change plans once again, I decided to fly to Moscow anyway.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince I could not leave the airport, I tried my best to rest in Sheremetyevo Airport for the eleven-hour transit before boarding my afternoon flight to Delhi where I had a 10:20 AM appointment at the Russian Embassy the following morning. To be safe, I booked a return flight to Moscow on May 4th morning, thinking that a week would give me enough time to get my work done in Delhi and to visit Bhakti Vijnana Goswami in Govardhana.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy the time I arrived in Delhi in the early hours of April 28th, I had all of the symptoms of bronchial asthma… a condition which, despite medication and long periods of resting, is still current as I am writing this blog. Needless to say, this illness has been a challenge in and of itself. But more challenges were yet come.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaving decided that, once again, I needed to stay in one place and recover before moving on, I proceeded to my 10:20 appointment in the embassy. Despite heavy Delhi traffic, we arrived at the embassy with five minutes to spare, only to find out that it was not going to be as easy to transfer the visa as expected. I was given a business card and was told that an online application needed to be submitted at the Russian Visa Services. They could not deal with the matter there in the embassy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe proceeded to the Russian Visa Services and after almost an hour of discussion between Madana-mohana dasa and a Russian Visa Services representative, the conclusion he was able to walk away with is that it would take 20 days minimum to get my visa transferred into my new passport. The representative recommended applying for a new visa, which could possibly take significantly less time if the application and documents were fully in order.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough we tried to get the visa transferred—from every possible angle—my conclusion was that I was again given time to stay in one place and attempt to recover before getting back on a plane once again. As it turned out, due to holidays in Russia, we could not even submit an application until the 2nd of May.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI then proceeded to Govardhana until the situation became more clear. Although I've been in Govardhana now for six days, I've been physically drained. I've not been able to do anything here other than chant, rest, read, and spend time with Bhakti Vijnana Goswami. We did call an Ayurvedic physician and without fail, I have been regularly taking the doses of medicine he prescribed. Still, his parting words of encouragement were that full recovery could take up to a month. Whether that recovery will be here or in Moscow still remains to be seen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTomorrow morning I'm leaving for Delhi where a meeting has been scheduled with Gopal Krsna Goswami. And, well… tomorrow we'll also see what progress has been made with my new visa application. I remain hopeful, but also prepared if still another challenge awaits me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI will say this, however. More and more evidence seems to be surfacing that health will become much more of a challenge for me if I continue at the same pace I'm traveling now. It's time for me to re-evaluate Srila Prabhupada's words which I quote often to others but also need to quote to myself, \"First—health, second—sadhana, and third—service.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

Upon arriving, just around midnight, I was greeted by Nrsimha Krsna dasa at the airport who then brought me to his home to rest for a few hours, to chant my rounds, to take breakfast, and to have some discussion with a few local devotees who came to see me. I decided to return to the airport three hours before departure, since security on direct flights from Istanbul to the United States can be more rigorous than on most other flights. Our discussion therefore continued into the car on the way to the airport.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI had one day to rest in the New York area and then proceeded to Hartford for a full day of consultation and meetings about a building the local devotees are considering to purchase for a new temple. There are more details I could give, but since the building acquisition is still a work in progress, I will wait until it's clear one way or the other if we will be able to get that building.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe next day, I proceeded to Boston, met up with Madhavananda dasa and Krishnakund dd, and then spent Sunday at the Boston temple. Since my schedule was already fixed prior to being delayed in Ukraine, unfortunately my visit to Boston was reduced from six days to one day. I'm still trying to think of a way I can make this up to the Boston devotees, hopefully with another visit before the end of this year.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Sunday in Boston, I took part in a gathering of congregational members to discuss ways to create a better preaching vision for the Boston congregational community. Devotees had a lot of good ideas to offer and then I was asked to cap the meeting with some words of wisdom. I'm not sure if my words had wisdom, but I was very happy to at least spend some time with the community members who did come for the gathering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was then able to listen to a very interesting talk on the \"Yoga of Lamentation\", given by Madhavananda Prabhu. After the talk, the devotees who remained after the Sunday Feast program very enthusiastically took part in a kirtan for the final aratik, an event which has become one of my favorite parts of my visits to Boston. During this time I was able to take my last darshan of the day, and unfortunately, also of my visit, of Their beautiful and most merciful Lordships Sri Sri Radha Gopivallabha.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEveryone seemed so enlivened with the kirtan that I decided to have another kirtan after the aratik, which seemed as if it could have gone on well into the night. But I reluctantly decided to end it at a reasonable time because I had to leave early the following morning for another visit to the potential new temple building in Hartford, which included further discussion about some of the major obstacles which would need to be overcome to acquire it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Tuesday late morning, I left Hartford with my godbrother Pyari Mohan Prabhu and his wife, Jivanausadhi dd, for an 18-hour journey to Alachua, Florida. We made a short stop in New Jersey to leave Madhavananda and Krishnakund for their week-long seminar tour in the New York area, to see the site of the new Towaco temple, and we then continued on our way to the home of our hosts, my godbrother, Purusartha Prabhu and his wife Tulasi dasi's home, stopping only once along the way for a restful night's rest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll in all, we had three wonderful programs in Alachua… an evening kirtan program at Purusartha Prabhu's home, an evening home program at the home of Jagadish dasa and Savitri devi dasi, and a morning informal gathering and kirtan in the association of old friends from the Boston temple who now live in Alachua.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was also able to meet up with a lot old friends from other communities and temples, including my godbrother, Kirtiraja Prabhu, with whom I served closely during the late 80's and early 90's while preaching in the former Soviet Union. I am looking forward to receiving him and his wife, Haripuja dasi, at the Bhakti Sangama Festival in September. He assured me that he will be coming this year.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately, other than one photo (posted below), I do not have any material from those programs to provide for the site. But sometimes these things show up in other places and devotees send photos, files, and/or links to the webmaster for posting at some later date.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYesterday morning, after our last gathering, I quickly packed and proceeded to South Florida where I will spend the next several days with Guru Gauranga Prabhu and his wife, who happen to live right around the corner from an uncle I continue to visit and who will be turning 90 this year. He's very favorable, friendly, and always very happy to see me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tto be continued…(hopefully)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/alachua.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 667px; border-width: 5px; border-style: solid; float: left;\" />\r\n</p>\r\n",

I can therefore send their donations directly to you in the form of a check along with anything else I may pick up along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCan I send it to the same place as last time?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHoping this meets you in good health.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYour servant,<br />\n\tNiranjana Swami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tP.S. Another devotee, Akriti devi dasi, handed me 4,500 rupees, also apparently after reading my blog, and asked if I could arrange to get that to you. That donation was already sent to the fundraising site in the form of an anonymous donation.\n</p>\n",

Learn this from the great devotees, and serve Sri Vrndavana.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt had been too many years since I had been on pilgrimage to Sri Vrndavana Dhama. Desiring to uncover at least some of Vrndavana's \"supreme secrets of devotion\", this year I made a plan to spend a few days in Vrndavana with my godbrother, Rohini Suta Prabhu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn October, when my health began troubling me as it often does after an exceptionally intense spring and summer of constant travel, and when I then went to Mayapura for my month-long rest and recuperation, I began to seriously doubt if I would be able to keep my commitment to go to Vrndavana before continuing my journey East, gradually on my way to the United States. However, towards the end of my stay in Mayapura, feeling much better than when I arrived, I recommitted myself to spend those few days in Vrndavana.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring my \"surprise\" visit, I expressed my mood for coming to disciples who were present in Vrndavana and who were invited to Rohini Suta Prabhu's flat for a short morning program.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately, I was not able to secure a recording of that talk. I will therefore attempt to capture the essence of it, and it is as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Since I have not come to Vrndavana for so long, I knew that if I wanted to get the most of my short visit, I should learn how to enter the dhama by going on parikrama with someone who resides here and who can show by example how to enter.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI then quoted the above verse by Sri Prabhodananda Sarasvati, leaving it up to the listeners to decide for themselves whether sense gratification, liberation, devotional service, or even all three, were motivating factors for coming to Vrndavana. The verse itself even suggests that whatever of those desires are there in our hearts, Vrndavana dhama can fulfill them in a very wonderful way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"I requested Rohini Suta Prabhu if he would kindly take me on parikrama anywhere in Vrndavana and wherever he wanted to take me. And although I arrived before meeting with all of you, I still wanted to see all of you, to share a few words with all of you, to invite all of you to our short morning program and then to invite you to accompany us on parikrama today.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaving already visited a few tirthas with Rohini Suta Prabhu, including Radha Madana-mohana temple, today we will be taking darshan of Radha Govinda, Radha Syamasundara, Radha Gopinath, Radha Ramana, Radha Gokulananda, Radha Damodara, and we will be ending our parikrama with darshans of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai, Krsna Balarama, Radha Syamasundara, Srila Prabhupada in his samadhi, and Srila Prabhupada's rooms by 11:30 AM so that I can leave for the airport by 12:30 PM to get my flight to Taiwan.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI then spoke individually, but briefly, with a few devotees, we honored prasadam, and we then boarded our previously arranged motor-rickshaws for our parikrama.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is more I could say about parikrama and the inspiration I felt from having my desires to go on parikrama with Rohini Suta Prabhu fulfilled, but I will simply say that everything went better than I could possibly hope and amazingly, every one of the Deity darshans were open without any interuption.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs I was leaving Krsna Balarama Mandir, at the time we pre-arranged to return to the flat, I turned to Rohini Suta Prabhu and said that I had one serious regret and that was that I wasn't sure if Radha Syamasundar would forgive me for not stopping to see Their servant, a long-time resident of Sri Vrndavana Dhama and my very dear friend, Bhuvaneshvara Prabhu, who has been cooking the raj bhoga offering for the Deities for so many years.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPreviously, whenever I visited Vrndanava, I would always visit Bhuvaneshvara Prabhu. He would usually have a huge plate of mahaprasadam from the lunch offering waiting for me so that we could honor lunch together in his room. I was feeling really bad for not stopping to see him and could not relinquish the thought from my mind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust at that very moment, as I turned towards the gate, Bhuvaneshvara Prabhu entered the same gate from the alley and was looking at me right in the eyes. I immediately embraced him, told him how I was thinking of him exactly at that moment, and then confessed why I was thinking of him. He simply smiled and we then exchanged a few confidential words about each other and each other's service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I asked Bhuvaneshvara prabhu if he was cooking the raj bhoga, he reminded me that Srimati Radharani was always doing the cooking and not him. He then immediately pulled out two sweets wrapped in tin foil that Radharani had prepared and shared one of them with me. I cannot describe how much happiness came into my heart as I embraced Bhuvaneshvara Prabhu once more in gratitude for the mahaprasadam, for the opportunity to see him, and for the realization that Radha Syamasundara made this wonderful arrangement for me so that I wouldn't have to beg Their forgiveness the next time I took Their darshan.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuch are the ways of Sri Vrndavana Dhama. Some of those secrets were being revealed to me by Radha Syamasundara's devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI jumped into the rickshaw, honored a small morsel from the sweet handed to me by Bhuvaneshvara Prabhu, and then distributed a small morsel of the same sweet to each and every devotee who approached me as I was returning to the flat. I thought for sure that there wouldn't be enough sweet to give to everyone. But it was almost as if the sweet was expanding as I was taking each morsel from it in order to provide maha to anyone who would approach me for the mercy. Srimati Radharani was spreading Her mercy, even to me, by giving me the opportunity to share Her mercy with others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI have some photos to share, though not many. But whatever I have will be posted in the photo section. There is also a small audio clip which Rohini Suta Prabhu took of a very devotional kirtan the Brijbasis were having during our darshan of Radha Govinda. And there is a short video clip of one Brijbasi from Bhandiravana, who was preparing lunch for his deities, which he also wanted to share with us after it was offered. The fresh rotis he prepared, by cooking them directly on the fire, were simply amazing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe evening before Sivarama Swami, Devamrita Swami and myself were having our usual evening reading and discussion (soon to be posted). While discussing a topic related to the holy name, I remembered one verse from Padyavali, part of which I used to quote from time to time and quoted it for them. Unknown to me, the next day Sivarama Maharaja began looking for the verse under the verses he had from Padyavali specifically related to the holy name, but was unable to find it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLast night I found the verse and sent it to Sivarama Maharaja. His response to me was \"Fantastic!\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile chanting japa this morning, I began meditating on that verse and couldn't resist sharing it with all of you.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut first, in order to best prepare you for the actual verse, I will cite the first verse of Padyavali written by Srila Rupa Goswami himself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tText 1<br />\r\n\tpadyavali viracita rasikair mukunda-<br />\r\n\tsambandha-bandhura-pada pramadormi-sindhuh<br />\r\n\tramya samasta-tamasam damani kramena<br />\r\n\tsangrhyate krti-kadambaka-kautukaya\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTranslation<br />\r\n\tThis Padyavali (Anthology of Poetry) was written by devotees expert in the mellows of devotional service. This book contains many beautiful verses, which have been collected for the pleasure of the devotees. It illuminates the darkness of ignorance, and it is an ocean of transcendental bliss.<br />\r\n\t-- Sri Rupa Gosvami<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI first quoted the verse above to give some understanding of what Rupa Goswami's Padyavali contains.

While discussing a topic related to the holy name, I remembered one verse from Padyavali, part of which I used to quote from time to time and quoted it for them. Unknown to me, the next day Sivarama Maharaja began looking for the verse under the verses he had from Padyavali specifically related to the holy name, but was unable to find it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLast night I found the verse and sent it to Sivarama Maharaja. His response to me was \"Fantastic!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile chanting japa this morning, I began meditating on that verse and couldn't resist sharing it with all of you.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut first, in order to best prepare you for the actual verse, I will cite the first verse of Padyavali written by Srila Rupa Goswami himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tText 1<br />\n\tpadyavali viracita rasikair mukunda-<br />\n\tsambandha-bandhura-pada pramadormi-sindhuh<br />\n\tramya samasta-tamasam damani kramena<br />\n\tsangrhyate krti-kadambaka-kautukaya\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTranslation<br />\n\tThis Padyavali (Anthology of Poetry) was written by devotees expert in the mellows of devotional service.

Now that stomach problems have surfaced again, I've chosen this approach this year.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHence, after Mumbai I will go directly to Mayapura, where I will fully withdraw for a minimum of one month.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo \"fully withdraw\" means that I will not attend any programs, I will not accept any invitations, I will not give any classes, I will not have any meetings, and I will not answer any email. I hope for everyone's cooperation in this regard. I sense that my body is trying to tell me that I've been abusing it with all of this travel. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tI am therefore appealing to everyone who reads this blog to please take advantage of all that's been made available to you on this site. Please also take advantage of the books which have been made available. During this time, I also hope to move some new book projects along and to review some transcripts for publishing on the site, something I've been neglecting for the past few years.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf anyone wishes to write reports, you may send reports through the authorized reporting system. I will continue to read any report sent to me. But please, do not include any medical advice.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, I will try my best to post regular blogs during the month of November to compensate for the fact that I will otherwise be unavailable for anything else during that time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you for your understanding.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tDear Srila Prabhupada,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlease accept my prostrated obeisances in the dust of your divine lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother year has already passed since the last time I read my offering before you on this most auspicious day of your divine appearance in this world. Each year brings new opportunities to glorify you throughout the year, and with that, new realizations of your infinite glories.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLast week in Ticino, Switzerland, I watched a video of your disciple, Guru Gauranga dasa, delivering an audio-visual presentation in Boston at the 50th anniversary of your arrival in Boston. His captivating and well-researched presentation was entitled \"A Most Improbable Journey.\" Although I was present when he first delivered his detailed account of your journey from Calcutta to Boston, and then on to New York, it wasn't until Ticino that I looked more deeply at your diary entry on September 10, 1965, entered as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Today the ship is plying very smoothly. I feel today better. But I am feeling separation from Sri Vrindaban and my Lords Sri Govinda, Gopinath, Radha Damodar. The only solace is Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita in which I am tasting the nectarine of Lord Chaitanya's Leela. I have left Bharat Bhumi just to execute the order of Sri Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati in pursuance of Lord Chaitanya's order. I have no qualification, but I have taken up the risk just to carry out the order of His Divine Grace. I depend fully on Their mercy so far away from Vrindaban.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI've read this before… in fact… so many times. But this time these words struck me with yet another one of the numerous confirmations I've discovered in service to you of how you were thinking then and throughout your divine lila of rescuing conditioned souls. Soon thereafter you would attempt to teach each and every one of your future disciples through your books, lectures and by your perfect example this very same principle of full submission to the Lord and His pure representative.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, the depth of your teachings can never be limited to only one method for realizing pure devotional service. As our founder-acarya, your pure example teaches all facets of Krsna consciousness to the highest degree. However, it is this particular quality in you which deeply captivates me, so much so that I find myself reflecting on it wherever I see it throughout all of your teachings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI know only too well how unqualified I am. In order to teach us everything by your example, therefore, for our sake, you consistently took the position of one who was not qualified even though you were the most qualified. This principle, demonstrated by your perfect example, gives me hope that fully serving you and some day even satisfying you, remains possible despite living in physical separation from you.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI remember the first time I read your concluding words upon completing your translation of \"Sri Caitanya Caritamrita\"… that same solace you wrote about in your journal while crossing the Atlantic Ocean. I clearly remember feeling overwhelmed by the devotion, humility, faith, submission, and transparency which you perfectly conveyed to your followers:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\" I think that His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura is always seeing my activities and guiding me within my heart by his words. As it is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam, tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye [SB 1.1.1]. Spiritual inspiration comes from within the heart, wherein the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His Paramatma feature, is always sitting with all His devotees and associates. It is to be admitted that whatever translation work I have done is through the inspiration of my spiritual master, because personally I am most insignificant and incompetent to do this materially impossible work. I do not think myself a very learned scholar, but I have full faith in the service of my spiritual master, His Divine Grace Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. If there is any credit to my activities of translating, it is all due to His Divine Grace.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI can no longer count the number of times I have read these concluding words. They are a constant reminder to me of the need to more deeply realize my own lack of qualification and thus develop an increasingly helpless dependence on everything you attempted to teach us when you were with us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot long thereafter, more than thirty years ago, when faced with the \"then\" daunting responsibilities I had as temple president, I discovered another very similar clue which you had given in Srimad Bhagavatam for carrying out the heavy duties you entrusted to me. While reading Brahma's prayers for creative potency, I read in one of your purports:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Any person authorized by either the Lord or by His bona fide representative is already blessed, as is the work entrusted to him. Of course, the person entrusted with such a responsibility should always be aware of his incapability and must always look for the mercy of the Lord for the successful execution of his duty. One should not be puffed up because he is entrusted with certain executive work. Fortunate is he who is so entrusted, and if he is always fixed in the sense of being subordinate to the will of the Supreme, he is sure to come out successful in the discharge of his work.\" (purport - SB 3.9.29)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat one purport saved me in times of deep desparation. Countless times I have read this purport and I continue to share it with devotees as a divine sutra \"to come out successful\" in all one's spiritual endeavors.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I was visiting the Bhaktivedanta Archives many years ago, your disciple, Ranjhit dasa, shared the original copy of your 1966 New York journal with me which he had just recently acquired from one of your early disciples. I asked him if I could take it into the other room and read it for awhile. He kindly agreed and I disappeared into the next room to scour through all of your entries. It was then that I took note of another diary entry dated February 3, 1966:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Today there was a very nice demonstration of tape-record Samkirtan by me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is all Grace of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Srila Haridas Thakur said that the transcendental sound of Hari Nama would even purify the heart of birds and beasts. Today this statement of Thakur Haridas is corroborated. These American can not understand even a word's meaning of the Sankirtan and yet they were so much attracted? It is all Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's power; there is no credit for me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI sat there captivated, tears coming from my eyes, appreciating these words so much, as testimony to your compassion, humility, and exclusive dependence on the mercy bestowed upon you from your worshipable Lord and divine masters. I immediately returned to Ranjhit Prabhu to share my discovery and then asked him for a pen and paper to write them down for my own personal safekeeping and as a constant reminder on how to render devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tActually, this mood, example and instruction is revealed unlimitedly by you, as well as in the thousands of testimonies your disciples have given based on what they personally heard from you and how they also had seen these qualities in you. Every moment you were present with us there was an instruction and example of surrender in full Krsna consciousness. You fully embodied the mood of humility in submission to the divine order coming both from within and without.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Krsna Himself declared to Arjuna:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me. If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada, on this most auspicious day of your divine appearance, I humbly fall at your lotus feet and beg you to continue to help me always be fully conscious of you. One may ask,<br />\r\n\t\"Why 'you' and not Krsna?\" Again, because you revealed another clue which I constantly remember in the most difficult of times:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"...if a disciple is very serious to execute the mission of the spiritual master, he immediately associates with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by vani or vapuh. This is the only secret of success in seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead of being eager to see the Lord in some bush of Vrndavana while at the same time engaging in sense gratification, if one instead sticks to the principle of following the words of the spiritual master, he will see the Supreme Lord without difficulty.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada, you are my only hope. It is my realization now, more than ever, that without remembering you, surely I will be lost.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the dust of your lotus feet,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYour eternal servant,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"safe_value": "<p>\n\tDear Srila Prabhupada,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPlease accept my prostrated obeisances in the dust of your divine lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother year has already passed since the last time I read my offering before you on this most auspicious day of your divine appearance in this world. Each year brings new opportunities to glorify you throughout the year, and with that, new realizations of your infinite glories.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week in Ticino, Switzerland, I watched a video of your disciple, Guru Gauranga dasa, delivering an audio-visual presentation in Boston at the 50th anniversary of your arrival in Boston. His captivating and well-researched presentation was entitled \"A Most Improbable Journey.\" Although I was present when he first delivered his detailed account of your journey from Calcutta to Boston, and then on to New York, it wasn't until Ticino that I looked more deeply at your diary entry on September 10, 1965, entered as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Today the ship is plying very smoothly. I feel today better. But I am feeling separation from Sri Vrindaban and my Lords Sri Govinda, Gopinath, Radha Damodar. The only solace is Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita in which I am tasting the nectarine of Lord Chaitanya's Leela. I have left Bharat Bhumi just to execute the order of Sri Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati in pursuance of Lord Chaitanya's order. I have no qualification, but I have taken up the risk just to carry out the order of His Divine Grace. I depend fully on Their mercy so far away from Vrindaban.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI've read this before… in fact… so many times. But this time these words struck me with yet another one of the numerous confirmations I've discovered in service to you of how you were thinking then and throughout your divine lila of rescuing conditioned souls. Soon thereafter you would attempt to teach each and every one of your future disciples through your books, lectures and by your perfect example this very same principle of full submission to the Lord and His pure representative.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, the depth of your teachings can never be limited to only one method for realizing pure devotional service. As our founder-acarya, your pure example teaches all facets of Krsna consciousness to the highest degree. However, it is this particular quality in you which deeply captivates me, so much so that I find myself reflecting on it wherever I see it throughout all of your teachings.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI know only too well how unqualified I am. In order to teach us everything by your example, therefore, for our sake, you consistently took the position of one who was not qualified even though you were the most qualified. This principle, demonstrated by your perfect example, gives me hope that fully serving you and some day even satisfying you, remains possible despite living in physical separation from you.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI remember the first time I read your concluding words upon completing your translation of \"Sri Caitanya Caritamrita\"… that same solace you wrote about in your journal while crossing the Atlantic Ocean. I clearly remember feeling overwhelmed by the devotion, humility, faith, submission, and transparency which you perfectly conveyed to your followers:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\" I think that His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura is always seeing my activities and guiding me within my heart by his words. As it is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam, tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye [SB 1.1.1]. Spiritual inspiration comes from within the heart, wherein the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His Paramatma feature, is always sitting with all His devotees and associates. It is to be admitted that whatever translation work I have done is through the inspiration of my spiritual master, because personally I am most insignificant and incompetent to do this materially impossible work. I do not think myself a very learned scholar, but I have full faith in the service of my spiritual master, His Divine Grace Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. If there is any credit to my activities of translating, it is all due to His Divine Grace.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI can no longer count the number of times I have read these concluding words. They are a constant reminder to me of the need to more deeply realize my own lack of qualification and thus develop an increasingly helpless dependence on everything you attempted to teach us when you were with us.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNot long thereafter, more than thirty years ago, when faced with the \"then\" daunting responsibilities I had as temple president, I discovered another very similar clue which you had given in Srimad Bhagavatam for carrying out the heavy duties you entrusted to me. While reading Brahma's prayers for creative potency, I read in one of your purports:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Any person authorized by either the Lord or by His bona fide representative is already blessed, as is the work entrusted to him. Of course, the person entrusted with such a responsibility should always be aware of his incapability and must always look for the mercy of the Lord for the successful execution of his duty. One should not be puffed up because he is entrusted with certain executive work. Fortunate is he who is so entrusted, and if he is always fixed in the sense of being subordinate to the will of the Supreme, he is sure to come out successful in the discharge of his work.\" (purport - SB 3.9.29)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat one purport saved me in times of deep desparation. Countless times I have read this purport and I continue to share it with devotees as a divine sutra \"to come out successful\" in all one's spiritual endeavors.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I was visiting the Bhaktivedanta Archives many years ago, your disciple, Ranjhit dasa, shared the original copy of your 1966 New York journal with me which he had just recently acquired from one of your early disciples. I asked him if I could take it into the other room and read it for awhile. He kindly agreed and I disappeared into the next room to scour through all of your entries. It was then that I took note of another diary entry dated February 3, 1966:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Today there was a very nice demonstration of tape-record Samkirtan by me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is all Grace of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Srila Haridas Thakur said that the transcendental sound of Hari Nama would even purify the heart of birds and beasts. Today this statement of Thakur Haridas is corroborated. These American can not understand even a word's meaning of the Sankirtan and yet they were so much attracted? It is all Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's power; there is no credit for me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI sat there captivated, tears coming from my eyes, appreciating these words so much, as testimony to your compassion, humility, and exclusive dependence on the mercy bestowed upon you from your worshipable Lord and divine masters.

Of those thirty-three devotees, twenty-seven of them are providing daily statistics, two of them started to fill out statistics but stopped completely shortly after they started, four of them never started at all for reasons unknown, and fortunately, only one of them seems to be using it for reasons other than keeping records of one's daily sadhana practices.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition, approximately ten devotees had an account but their account was removed because it was not being used.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMy purpose for providing this facility was manifold:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t1) to give devotees struggling with sadhana the opportunity to become more accountable for their sadhana practices,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t2) to give devotees struggling with sadhana the opportunity to keep a record of their own performance in order to better see for themselves where they are lacking and where they need to improve,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t3) to encourage devotees who either were or currently are struggling to come up to the prescribed standards, to maintain steadiness… even if it's to a lesser standard,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t4) to encourage devotees to increase whenever they feel they have the strength and commitment to do so,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t5) to encourage devotees with their sadhana in general, simply by providing this extra facility for accountability,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t6) to give initiated devotees a private venue to disclose that they are not able to maintain his/her vow to chant sixteen rounds daily,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t7) to help initiated devotees better deal with any possible guilt they may have for their inability to maintain their sixteen rounds,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t8) to help devotees feel a closer connection between their sadhana and their service to their spiritual master(s),\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t9) and to show that I understand the struggles devotees encounter with their japa, especially devotees who are not living either in, or near to a temple.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are probably, even more, reasons I could give, but for now, these are the ones which seem most important to me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince I regularly review all of these sadhana sheets and because I plan to continue to do so, then naturally I cannot open this facility up to hundreds of devotees. To do so would create the risk of being unable to monitor everyone's sheet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, I am encouraged by the fact that devotees are taking advantage of this facility and naturally I am also encouraged when I get reports of how this facility has encouraged them as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, I am now ready to open this facility up to more devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout knowing how many new accounts will be requested, I will not set a limit yet.

If anyone is found to be using their daily sadhana sheet for anything other than for reporting one's daily sadhana, the administrator has been instructed to close their account without notice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, I am ready to adjust the first condition (#1) and will now also allow devotees who are chanting 16 rounds daily, to request a sadhana sheet if it encourages them to do so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo sign up for a daily sadhana sheet simply provide the information required in the form below.\r\n</p>\r\n<!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form -->\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<link href=\"//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\r\n\t<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }\r\n\t/* Add your own MailChimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.\r\n\t   We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file. */\t</style>\r\n</p>\r\n<div id=\"mc_embed_signup\">\r\n\t<form action=\"//niranjanaswami.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=0ecb19bcca570915639cca898&amp;id=8b6ceaa474\" class=\"validate\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" method=\"post\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" novalidate=\"\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n\t\t<div id=\"mc_embed_signup_scroll\">\r\n\t\t\t<h2>\r\n\t\t\t\tSignup for Sadhana Sheet\r\n\t\t\t</h2>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"indicates-required\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"asterisk\">*</span> indicates required\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"mc-field-group\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<label for=\"mce-EMAIL\">Email Address <span class=\"asterisk\">*</span> </label> <input class=\"required email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\" name=\"EMAIL\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" />\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"mc-field-group\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<label for=\"mce-INAME\">Initiated Name or Legal Name (if not initiated) <span class=\"asterisk\">*</span> </label> <input class=\"required\" id=\"mce-INAME\" name=\"INAME\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" />\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"clear\" id=\"mce-responses\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"response\" id=\"mce-error-response\" style=\"display:none\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"response\" id=\"mce-success-response\" style=\"display:none\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups-->\r\n\t\t\t<div aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<input name=\"b_0ecb19bcca570915639cca898_8b6ceaa474\" tabindex=\"-1\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" />\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"clear\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<input class=\"button\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" />\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</form>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='//s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.mailchimp.com/js/mc-validate.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>(function($) {window.fnames = new Array(); window.ftypes = new Array();fnames[0]='EMAIL';ftypes[0]='email';fnames[1]='INAME';ftypes[1]='text';}(jQuery));var $mcj = jQuery.noConflict(true);</script><!--End mc_embed_signup-->",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is a partially edited transcription of a talk given about Giriraja's service to Krsna on June 27, 2009, in New Vraja Dhama, on the occasion of New Vraja Dhama's First Annual Vrndavana Parikrama. The talk was given on \"Govardhana Hill\" in New Vraja Dhama.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo I have been requested to speak about learning devotion from Giriraja. If we want to learn about and understand devotional service, then we must obtain the mercy of a devotee of the Lord. Otherwise devotional service will always remain a great mystery. So even the gopis who are the greatest devotees of the Lord are thinking that \"If we want to obtain the fulfillment of our desires, then we should worship the devotee.\" So the gopis are thinking this way and they are the topmost devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe've learned from Brhad Bhagavatamrita that they are the greatest receptacles of Krsna's mercy. But still the gopis are thinking \"We have this desire that we want fulfilled. We want to be able to meet Krsna and in order to be able to meet Krsna we must serve a devotee of Krsna.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo who did the gopis proclaim as the best devotee of Krsna? They proclaimed Giriraja as the best devotee. In Srimad Bhagavatam they have said, \"Of all the devotees, this Govardhana Hill is the best! O my friends, this hill supplies Krsna and Balarama, along with Their calves, cows and cowherd friends, with all kinds of necessities -- water for drinking, very soft grass, caves, fruits, flowers and vegetables. In this way the hill offers respects to the Lord. Being touched by the lotus feet of Krsna and Balarama, Govardhana Hill appears very jubilant.\" (SB 10.21.18)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo this is the meditation the gopis have. They are thinking that Giriraja is the best servant of Krsna. Hari-dasa-varyah. Giriraja is understood both as the greatest servant of Krsna and as Krsna Himself. He assumed this form of Govardhana Hill in order to accept all the offerings of the residents of Vrndavana. In this way, the Lord, after assuming this wonderful form, also simultaneously offered worship to that form.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSivarama Maharaja was just saying that there is a special characteristic of Govardhana Hill here in New Vraja Dhama. Here we can walk on Him. But Lord Caitanya in Vrndavana, also established the principle that one should not walk on Govardhana Hill. He worshiped Govardhana as nondifferent than Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor three continuous years, Lord Caitanya carried a Govardhana sila and a gunja mala. He was given both of these from a devotee named Sankarananda Sarasvati. He would oftentimes take the sila and He would put it to His head, embrace it to His heart and He would bathe the sila with His tears. So in this way Lord Caitanya worshiped Giriraja as nondifferent from Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter worshiping Him in this way, He gave both the sila and gunja mala to Raghunath das Goswami to worship and told him, \"Carefully worship this sila by offering water and offering tulasi and by so doing, intense love and greed will awaken within your heart.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo in this way, we understand Giriraja as being nondifferent from the Supreme Lord. But we want to see Giriraja specifically for the sake of developing our internal devotion, we want to see Giriraja also as hari-dasa-varyah, as a servant of the Lord. We should want to follow that principle that if we want the fulfillment of our desires, then we must render service to and we must worship a great devotee of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo in this verse it is described how Giriraja is actually rendering service to the Lord by assisting Him in His pastimes. Yesterday we were describing how the Lord's internal potency assists the Lord in the facilitation of His desires to enjoy with His devotees. So in the same way, Giriraja also assists the Lord to facilitate His desire to reciprocate with His devotees. How does He serve the Lord? He serves the Lord by serving His devotees, the cowherd boys, and by serving the cows and calves all of whom are very, very dear to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGiriraja is providing so many opulences of Vrndavana for the service of the Supreme Lord. When we think of opulences, we think of something which is very great, very wonderful, and very lavish. But the opulences of Vrndavana are those items which serve the Lord and His devotees in His pastimes such as fresh water, which the Lord can take for drinking, for taking bath, and for washing His mouth after taking prasadam with His cowherd boy friends.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGiriraja also provides very nice soft grasses for Krsna's cows. This grass is a very special aromatic grass that is very, very pleasing to the cows. The cows are very much inclined take only this grass on Govardhana Hill. That is one of the qualities of the grass on Govardhana Hill. It is so aromatic that it attracts Krsna's cows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother quality of the grass growing on Govardhana Hill is that it is very nourishing for Krsna's cows. In this way the cows never feel any hunger, disease, or fatigue. It is very soft grass; so soft that even in the summer when there is no rain, the cows never pierce their lips or tongues by chewing on the grass. The result is that the cows who eat this grass provide very aromatic and nourishing milk.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMother Yasoda was very eager to personally take this milk from the cows who had eaten this special, aromatic grass. So she personally selected this milk in order to prepare some nice yogurt and butter for Krsna. In this way, she hoped that Krsna would stop going to the neighboring houses to steal their butter and yogurt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough she was the queen of Vrndavana and she could have arranged for anybody to prepare this butter for Krsna, still she wanted to do it herself because she was thinking, \"They won't do it right.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Govardhana provides this type of grass for Krsna's cows. Giriraja also provides very nice caves for Krsna and His cowherd boy friends to take shelter from the heat of the hot summer sun and to get out of the rain when it is raining. And although we know that the gopis here are seeing Giriraja in terms of the service He renders specifically to Krsna, Balarama, His cows, calves and cowherd boy friends, we know that those same caves also are very wonderful places where Krsna goes to meet with the gopis.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe gopis were speaking this way because they are seeing how Giriraja is a very intimate associate of Krsna. They are very eager to serve Him because they want to get Krsna's intimate association in the same way as Giriraja does..\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Giriraja is also providing very nice fruits wonderful types of drinks, mangoes and pilu juice. Srila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur also explains in his commentary how Giriraja is providing smooth stones the cowherd boys can use as mirrors, and for sitting places where Krsna and His friends sit down to take their lunch. He also provides jewels to decorate the body. These are the opulences Giriraja is offering as seva, or service to the Supreme Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur has given us a very wonderful explanation of how the gopis were thinking about Giriraja. Once, the gopis were saying \"We have heard from Gargi (who is the daughter of Gargamuni) that without rendering service to a devotee one cannot get the fulfillment of one's desires. Therefore since Govardhana Hill is the best of all devotees, we should go to that place. Let us take our bath at Manasa Ganga and take darshan of Harideva.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis deity of Harideva manifested because of the intense feelings of separation the gopis had for Him there. Prior to that, the gopis were feeling a very intense separation from Krsna and they were standing at this place by Manasa Ganga, calling out the name, \"Harideva, Harideva, Harideva.\" Due to their intense desire to see Krsna, this deity manifested there and was called Harideva. From that day on the gopis would come there every day and would worship that Deity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe gopis continued, \"Certainly our elders will have no objection to this.\" As we know, the gopis were always very concerned about what their elders would say if they were found associating with Krsna. But now the gopis were thinking \"How can they possibly complain if we simply go there and take darshan of Harideva. But while we are there, we will get the opportunity to see Krsna who will be with His cowherd boys friends on the slopes of Govardhana Hill.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo deciding upon this plan, the gopis glorified Govardhana because He fulfills the desires of Krsna and His companions and hopefully He would then fulfill their desires to meet Krsna. So this is the gopis' meditation. This is how they see Giriraja as the best of all the servants of Krsna because Giriraja facilitates all these pastimes of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGiriraja also served the Lord by manifesting Himself as an umbrella in order to protect His Vrndavana devotees who were being inundated by the torrential rains sent by Indra. In this way Giriraja facilitated another wonderful pastime of the Lord, bringing all of the devotees together in one place to be with Krsna. Although ordinarily, the devotees see Krsna differently according to the places they meet, the unique quality of this pastime is that all of the devotees were all with Krsna in one place at the same time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor instance Mother Yasoda does not know that Krsna was somewhere other than in bed at night. She has her vatsalya prema and always sees everything connected to Krsna's being her young son. When Krsna would be in bed in the morning, Mother Yasoda would see scratches on His body and would think that these scratches were there because Krsna was not careful while He was out playing during the previous day, running into thorns and branches in the forest along with His friends. So in this way her vatsalya prema was never disturbed by thinking that Krsna was someplace else during the night.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Mother Yasoda would see Krsna at home and she would also see Krsna when He was leaving to go off to the pasturing grounds in the morning. She would want to go with Krsna when He was going off to the pasturing grounds but Krsna wouldn't let her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMother Yasoda would make so many different excuses to prevent Krsna from going into the pasturing grounds. As He was leaving with His friends, she would stop Him to give Him something to eat. Then she would walk back towards the house and she would turn to look at Krsna finding another reason to go and to be with her son. Then she would return back to Him and she would adjust His clothing so that it would look proper. After doing that she would have to walk back towards the house, again anticipating Krsna's departure. But since she didn't want Krsna to leave, she would walk back to Him again and would tell all of His friends, \"Now protect my son and make sure that you stand on all sides and behind Him so that nothing dangerous happens to Him when He's in the forest and pasturing grounds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen she would turn again to return to her home, but then she would find another reason to go to Him. But Krsna finally went and clasped her lotus feet and said, \"Mother, please go home. My friends are waiting.\" And Mother Yasoda would just stand there. It's described in the Brhad Bhagavatamrita how she appeared just like a painted picture or like a cow feeling separation from her calf as Krsna was turning around and walking into the pasturing grounds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut in this Govardhana lila, when Krsna lifted Govardhana Hill, Giriraja facilitated such a wonderful pastime of arranging all of the devotees to be together in the same place for seven continuous days. So in this way, Giriraja is also facilitating the Lord's pastimes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we are worshiping and remembering Giriraja today as a great devotee of Lord Krsna. In this way we should understand that if we ever want to participate in the Lord's pastimes and if we want to be in the association of the Lord, then we must obtain the mercy of a devotee of the Lord. We can never obtain devotional service of the Lord without obtaining the mercy of Krsna's devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo hopefully today we have learned a little about devotion to Lord Krsna by remembering Giriraja in His role as the greatest servant of Lord Krsna. If we worship and serve Giriraja we also can have hope within our hearts that we may obtain the association of Krsna some day in His eternal pastimes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOK. So we will stop here and let Lokanath Maharaja speak. Hare Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n",

The talk was given on \"Govardhana Hill\" in New Vraja Dhama.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tSo I have been requested to speak about learning devotion from Giriraja. If we want to learn about and understand devotional service, then we must obtain the mercy of a devotee of the Lord. Otherwise devotional service will always remain a great mystery. So even the gopis who are the greatest devotees of the Lord are thinking that \"If we want to obtain the fulfillment of our desires, then we should worship the devotee.\" So the gopis are thinking this way and they are the topmost devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe've learned from Brhad Bhagavatamrita that they are the greatest receptacles of Krsna's mercy. But still the gopis are thinking \"We have this desire that we want fulfilled. We want to be able to meet Krsna and in order to be able to meet Krsna we must serve a devotee of Krsna.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo who did the gopis proclaim as the best devotee of Krsna? They proclaimed Giriraja as the best devotee. In Srimad Bhagavatam they have said, \"Of all the devotees, this Govardhana Hill is the best! O my friends, this hill supplies Krsna and Balarama, along with Their calves, cows and cowherd friends, with all kinds of necessities -- water for drinking, very soft grass, caves, fruits, flowers and vegetables. In this way the hill offers respects to the Lord. Being touched by the lotus feet of Krsna and Balarama, Govardhana Hill appears very jubilant.\" (SB 10.21.18)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is the meditation the gopis have. They are thinking that Giriraja is the best servant of Krsna. Hari-dasa-varyah. Giriraja is understood both as the greatest servant of Krsna and as Krsna Himself. He assumed this form of Govardhana Hill in order to accept all the offerings of the residents of Vrndavana. In this way, the Lord, after assuming this wonderful form, also simultaneously offered worship to that form.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSivarama Maharaja was just saying that there is a special characteristic of Govardhana Hill here in New Vraja Dhama. Here we can walk on Him. But Lord Caitanya in Vrndavana, also established the principle that one should not walk on Govardhana Hill. He worshiped Govardhana as nondifferent than Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor three continuous years, Lord Caitanya carried a Govardhana sila and a gunja mala. He was given both of these from a devotee named Sankarananda Sarasvati. He would oftentimes take the sila and He would put it to His head, embrace it to His heart and He would bathe the sila with His tears. So in this way Lord Caitanya worshiped Giriraja as nondifferent from Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter worshiping Him in this way, He gave both the sila and gunja mala to Raghunath das Goswami to worship and told him, \"Carefully worship this sila by offering water and offering tulasi and by so doing, intense love and greed will awaken within your heart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in this way, we understand Giriraja as being nondifferent from the Supreme Lord. But we want to see Giriraja specifically for the sake of developing our internal devotion, we want to see Giriraja also as hari-dasa-varyah, as a servant of the Lord. We should want to follow that principle that if we want the fulfillment of our desires, then we must render service to and we must worship a great devotee of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in this verse it is described how Giriraja is actually rendering service to the Lord by assisting Him in His pastimes. Yesterday we were describing how the Lord's internal potency assists the Lord in the facilitation of His desires to enjoy with His devotees. So in the same way, Giriraja also assists the Lord to facilitate His desire to reciprocate with His devotees. How does He serve the Lord? He serves the Lord by serving His devotees, the cowherd boys, and by serving the cows and calves all of whom are very, very dear to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGiriraja is providing so many opulences of Vrndavana for the service of the Supreme Lord. When we think of opulences, we think of something which is very great, very wonderful, and very lavish. But the opulences of Vrndavana are those items which serve the Lord and His devotees in His pastimes such as fresh water, which the Lord can take for drinking, for taking bath, and for washing His mouth after taking prasadam with His cowherd boy friends.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGiriraja also provides very nice soft grasses for Krsna's cows. This grass is a very special aromatic grass that is very, very pleasing to the cows. The cows are very much inclined take only this grass on Govardhana Hill. That is one of the qualities of the grass on Govardhana Hill. It is so aromatic that it attracts Krsna's cows.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother quality of the grass growing on Govardhana Hill is that it is very nourishing for Krsna's cows. In this way the cows never feel any hunger, disease, or fatigue. It is very soft grass; so soft that even in the summer when there is no rain, the cows never pierce their lips or tongues by chewing on the grass. The result is that the cows who eat this grass provide very aromatic and nourishing milk.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMother Yasoda was very eager to personally take this milk from the cows who had eaten this special, aromatic grass. So she personally selected this milk in order to prepare some nice yogurt and butter for Krsna. In this way, she hoped that Krsna would stop going to the neighboring houses to steal their butter and yogurt.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough she was the queen of Vrndavana and she could have arranged for anybody to prepare this butter for Krsna, still she wanted to do it herself because she was thinking, \"They won't do it right.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Govardhana provides this type of grass for Krsna's cows. Giriraja also provides very nice caves for Krsna and His cowherd boy friends to take shelter from the heat of the hot summer sun and to get out of the rain when it is raining. And although we know that the gopis here are seeing Giriraja in terms of the service He renders specifically to Krsna, Balarama, His cows, calves and cowherd boy friends, we know that those same caves also are very wonderful places where Krsna goes to meet with the gopis.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe gopis were speaking this way because they are seeing how Giriraja is a very intimate associate of Krsna. They are very eager to serve Him because they want to get Krsna's intimate association in the same way as Giriraja does..\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Giriraja is also providing very nice fruits wonderful types of drinks, mangoes and pilu juice. Srila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur also explains in his commentary how Giriraja is providing smooth stones the cowherd boys can use as mirrors, and for sitting places where Krsna and His friends sit down to take their lunch. He also provides jewels to decorate the body. These are the opulences Giriraja is offering as seva, or service to the Supreme Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur has given us a very wonderful explanation of how the gopis were thinking about Giriraja. Once, the gopis were saying \"We have heard from Gargi (who is the daughter of Gargamuni) that without rendering service to a devotee one cannot get the fulfillment of one's desires. Therefore since Govardhana Hill is the best of all devotees, we should go to that place. Let us take our bath at Manasa Ganga and take darshan of Harideva.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis deity of Harideva manifested because of the intense feelings of separation the gopis had for Him there. Prior to that, the gopis were feeling a very intense separation from Krsna and they were standing at this place by Manasa Ganga, calling out the name, \"Harideva, Harideva, Harideva.\" Due to their intense desire to see Krsna, this deity manifested there and was called Harideva. From that day on the gopis would come there every day and would worship that Deity.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe gopis continued, \"Certainly our elders will have no objection to this.\" As we know, the gopis were always very concerned about what their elders would say if they were found associating with Krsna. But now the gopis were thinking \"How can they possibly complain if we simply go there and take darshan of Harideva. But while we are there, we will get the opportunity to see Krsna who will be with His cowherd boys friends on the slopes of Govardhana Hill.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo deciding upon this plan, the gopis glorified Govardhana because He fulfills the desires of Krsna and His companions and hopefully He would then fulfill their desires to meet Krsna. So this is the gopis' meditation. This is how they see Giriraja as the best of all the servants of Krsna because Giriraja facilitates all these pastimes of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGiriraja also served the Lord by manifesting Himself as an umbrella in order to protect His Vrndavana devotees who were being inundated by the torrential rains sent by Indra. In this way Giriraja facilitated another wonderful pastime of the Lord, bringing all of the devotees together in one place to be with Krsna. Although ordinarily, the devotees see Krsna differently according to the places they meet, the unique quality of this pastime is that all of the devotees were all with Krsna in one place at the same time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor instance Mother Yasoda does not know that Krsna was somewhere other than in bed at night. She has her vatsalya prema and always sees everything connected to Krsna's being her young son. When Krsna would be in bed in the morning, Mother Yasoda would see scratches on His body and would think that these scratches were there because Krsna was not careful while He was out playing during the previous day, running into thorns and branches in the forest along with His friends. So in this way her vatsalya prema was never disturbed by thinking that Krsna was someplace else during the night.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Mother Yasoda would see Krsna at home and she would also see Krsna when He was leaving to go off to the pasturing grounds in the morning. She would want to go with Krsna when He was going off to the pasturing grounds but Krsna wouldn't let her.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMother Yasoda would make so many different excuses to prevent Krsna from going into the pasturing grounds. As He was leaving with His friends, she would stop Him to give Him something to eat. Then she would walk back towards the house and she would turn to look at Krsna finding another reason to go and to be with her son. Then she would return back to Him and she would adjust His clothing so that it would look proper. After doing that she would have to walk back towards the house, again anticipating Krsna's departure. But since she didn't want Krsna to leave, she would walk back to Him again and would tell all of His friends, \"Now protect my son and make sure that you stand on all sides and behind Him so that nothing dangerous happens to Him when He's in the forest and pasturing grounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen she would turn again to return to her home, but then she would find another reason to go to Him. But Krsna finally went and clasped her lotus feet and said, \"Mother, please go home. My friends are waiting.\" And Mother Yasoda would just stand there. It's described in the Brhad Bhagavatamrita how she appeared just like a painted picture or like a cow feeling separation from her calf as Krsna was turning around and walking into the pasturing grounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in this Govardhana lila, when Krsna lifted Govardhana Hill, Giriraja facilitated such a wonderful pastime of arranging all of the devotees to be together in the same place for seven continuous days. So in this way, Giriraja is also facilitating the Lord's pastimes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we are worshiping and remembering Giriraja today as a great devotee of Lord Krsna. In this way we should understand that if we ever want to participate in the Lord's pastimes and if we want to be in the association of the Lord, then we must obtain the mercy of a devotee of the Lord. We can never obtain devotional service of the Lord without obtaining the mercy of Krsna's devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo hopefully today we have learned a little about devotion to Lord Krsna by remembering Giriraja in His role as the greatest servant of Lord Krsna. If we worship and serve Giriraja we also can have hope within our hearts that we may obtain the association of Krsna some day in His eternal pastimes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOK. So we will stop here and let Lokanath Maharaja speak. Hare Krsna.\n</p>\n",

The tongue is compared to a desert because a desert needs a constant supply of refreshing water to make it fertile and fruitful. Water is the substance most needed in the desert. The transient pleasure derived from mundane topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, dry philosophy, poetry and so on is compared to a mere drop of water because although such topics have a qualitative feature of transcendental pleasure, they are saturated with the modes of material nature. Therefore neither collectively nor individually can they satisfy the vast requirements of the desertlike tongue. Despite crying in various conferences, therefore, the desertlike tongue continues to be parched. For this reason, people from all parts of the world must call for the devotees of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who are compared to swans swimming around the beautiful lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu or bees humming around His lotus feet in transcendental pleasure, searching for honey. The dryness of material happiness cannot be moistened by so-called philosophers who cry for Brahman, liberation and similar dry speculative objects. The urge of the soul proper is different. The soul can be solaced only by the mercy of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His many bona fide devotees, who never leave the lotus feet of the Lord to become imitation Mahaprabhus but all cling to His lotus feet like bees that never leave a honey-soaked lotus flower.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Caitanya's movement of Krsna consciousness is full of dancing and singing about the pastimes of Lord Krsna. It is compared herein to the pure waters of the Ganges, which are full of lotus flowers. The enjoyers of these lotus flowers are the pure devotees, who are like bees and swans. They chant like the flowing of the Ganges, the river of the celestial kingdom. The author desires such sweetly flowing waves to cover his tongue. He humbly compares himself to materialistic persons who always engage in dry talk from which they derive no satisfaction. If they were to use their dry tongues to chant the holy name of the Lord-Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare-as exemplified by Lord Caitanya, they would taste sweet nectar and enjoy life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPURPORT by Niranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a very beautiful verse composed by Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Goswami. He is using graphic metaphors to describe the characteristics of the Lord’s pastimes and the devotees who relish hearing and chanting about the Lord's pastimes. He compares the transcendental activities of the Lord to be like the nectarean Ganges water which continuously flows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOut of humility Krsnadasa Kaviraja Goswami says that his own tongue is like a desert. In a desert, drinking a few drops of water is not very beneficial. In the desert one requires large quantities of water in order to satisfy one’s need. Therefore he also uses this metaphor about his tongue to help us understand the necessity to take advantage of the continuous flow of the Ganges which is compared to the method for hearing the pastimes of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Another metaphor he uses is that this river is beautified by the presence of many lotus flowers, which are compared to singing, dancing, and loud chanting of Krishna's holy names. These are ornaments that make the river even more attractive. And these ornaments are the pleasure abodes for devotees. The devotees are compared to be like ducks, swans and bees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn many places ducks and swans are compared to be like the beautiful ornaments on the body of water. They are often contrasted to crows who go to places much different than pleasure abodes. The bees are compared to those persons who are always very eager to drink the nectar of honey from the lotus feet of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore the devotees are described as persons who take shelter of these pleasure abodes, these ornamental places on the river and make them even more beautiful, because wherever these lotus flowers are, the devotees are also there very eager to drink the nectar of singing, dancing and loud chanting of the glories of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen Kaviraja Goswami uses another metaphor. The \"flowing of this river produces a beautiful sound that gladdens the ears,\" Such a transcendental sound vibration goes into the ear and enters into the heart. Lord Kapiladeva explains in His instruction to His mother, that by hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in the association of devotees they enter into the ear and go into the heart. When one advances along the path of devotional service by the continuous hearing of these nectarean pastimes and gradually he loses his taste for dry topics. He loses his attraction to those things that have no connection to Krsna and becomes attached to Krsna and then, sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati (SB 3.25.25), pure devotional service begins to awaken in his heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this verse Kaviraja Goswami created this metaphor which describes the whole process of devotional service, which ultimately gives satisfaction to the thirsty soul who is hankering for more than just a few drops of water in the desert.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn contrast, Srila Prabhupada explains that the transient pleasure which is derived from mundane topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, dry philosophy, poetry and so on are compared to be like a drop of water in the desert. They cannot satisfy the need of the desert-like tongue, just as a few drops of water cannot satisfy the need of a person who requires large quantities of water to revive his health and his well-being.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore Kaviraja Goswami here emphasizes that one has to hear the nectarean pastimes of Lord Caitanya . \"The nectarean Ganges of the water, of transcendental activities flows on the surface of my desertlike tongue.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere’s a very important pastime of Lord Caitanya in this connection. Hearing this pastime of the Lord is for our benefit – for both the audience and for the speaker. Although such pastimes are compared to the flowing of the Ganges, I am not sure I can make them flow nicely enough to alleviate the needs of my own desert-like tongue and of anyone else who may require a large quantity of water. Nonetheless this pastime is very relishable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis pastime takes place over a span of different occasions, but it begins with Lord Caitanya's Mahaprakasa-lila as described in Caitanya Bhagavat. Lord Caitanya was very eager to bestow benedictions upon His devotees during this lila, otherwise known as His sata-prahariya-bhava, or the ecstasy of twenty-one hours.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring this particular time, the Lord changed His disposition towards His devotees. Although He descended to assume the role of a devotee, during His ecstasy of twenty-one hours, He assumed the position of the Supreme Lord. In order to reciprocate with His devotees, He stood upon the altar and one by one called His devotees before Him and requested them to ask Him for a benediction. In this way the devotees who were hankering so much to experience the Lord in their presence were given that opportunity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord was also very eager to satisfy the innermost desires within the hearts of His devotees by giving them benedictions that were very pleasing to them. He called each devotee individually and revealed to each and every one of them how He had previously manifested Himself to them before He had even appeared in this world. The devotees could then understand that only the Lord could reveal something like that to them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne by one the Lord called His devotees who all appeared in this world before Him. To each and every devotee He described how He had previously manifested Himself to them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe called Haridasa Thakura and told him that when he was being beaten through twenty-two market places, Lord Caitanya&nbsp; personally came to protect him. The reason why he didn’t feel any pain is because Lord Caitanya&nbsp; personally laid on his back and accepted the blows Himself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe called Gangadas and said, \"Do you remember when you were fleeing out of fear of the attack of the Muslims? You and your family went to the Ganges and thought, 'How will it be possible to cross?' Do you remember that all of a sudden there was a boatman who came and asked you to come into the boat and then carried you across the water?\" Gangadas was shocked, thinking \"How did He know that a boatman came?\" \"I was that boatman\", Lord Caitanya declared. Gangadas was overwhelmed with ecstasy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne by one He called His devotees and spoke in this way. When He called Srivasa He asked, \"Srivasa, do you remember that time when you were walking along and heard one person, Devananda Pandit reciting Srimad Bhagavatam? Because of your desire to relish Srimad Bhagavatam, knowing that every syllable of Srimad Bhagavatam is pure ecstatic love for the Lord, you entered that place to hear Srimad Bhagavatam from him. You sat and listened to Srimad Bhagavatam from Devananda realizing the full meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam and you began manifesting ecstatic symptoms of love. But this Devananda was a dry speculative philosopher. Although he was speaking from Srimad Bhagavatam, he never mentioned anything about pure devotional service.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevananda Pandit was known by everyone as such a knowledgeable speaker of Bhagavatam. His students would come every day and hear him speak, but it was simply dry philosophy. Although he was austere and knowledgeable and all his students would come and listen attentively to everything he had to say, he was not glorifying pure devotional service. He could not glorify pure devotional service due to some offence he had previously committed, and therefore his students also did not know the glories of pure devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Do you remember what happened? When his students saw you manifesting ecstatic symptoms, they thought you were a disturbance to Devananda's recitation. They could not appreciate your pure devotion because none of them knew anything about it. They never heard about pure devotion before. Neither did Devananda Pandit ever speak about it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Thinking that it was more important to hear from Devananda Pandit, they picked you up and carried you outside. Do you remember how you felt? You went home, sat there and began reading Srimad Bhagavatam. While reading Srimad Bhagavatam tears of ecstasy began flowing from your eyes. Do you know why you felt this way? Because while you were reading Srimad Bhagavatam, I entered your heart. Because I entered your heart, you experienced such ecstatic love that you had never experienced before. Do you remember when that took place, Srivasa?\" Of course, Srivasa remembered and understood that the Lord was so kind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this connection, I would like to read one verse Vrndavana das Thakur wrote within the context of this pastime and a small but very relevant commentary from Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Devananda did not stop them. As the guru was ignorant, so were his disciples.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Commentary]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince the students under the shelter of Devananda, their teacher, could not understand the fruits of Srivasa's devotional service, they committed offenses at the feet of Srivasa because they were controlled by their material perception. Because the teacher, Devananda, did not check the actions of his ignorant students, he was also guilty of the offense. Devananda, who was ignorant of devotional service, gave no information about the exalted position of devotional service in his teachings to his students. Therefore since the guru had no qualification in devotional service, his disciples were also devoid of devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUpon seeing the merciful pure devotees' method of preaching through chanting, many people nowadays say that it is better to worship the Lord at home in solitude. They say various obstacles such as false ego and pride attack one who preaches through chanting. But in this instance, if a person like Devananda Pandita remains ignorant about devotional service and does not preach the glories of devotional service, he commits an offense. This is the purport of this pastime. A scarcity of devotional service is seen in every activity of this world, but if one does not engage in glorifying the Lord to remove that scarcity, he is touched by offense.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami: Very powerful words from the Acharya. He says that there’s a scarcity of glorification of pure devotional service and it’s seen in every activity of this world. If one does not glorify pure devotional service to remove that scarcity, he is influenced by that offence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada also described in the purport to today’s verse that the soul is hankering, the tongue and ears are hankering, for the flowing river of nectar. In the desert a few drops of water, compared to the topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, etc., cannot satisfy the needs of the soul. The soul cannot be satisfied by a few drops. It needs relief from a flowing river.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Fourth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam Narada Muni states:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and thus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant flow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- namely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" (SB 4.29.39-40)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat’s what the living entity needs. He needs to transcend the bodily concept of life. The way to transcend the bodily concept of life is to hear the glories of pure devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam it is stated:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Pure devotional service rendered to the Supreme Lord is spiritually so potent that simply by hearing about such transcendental service, by chanting its glories in response, by meditating on it, by respectfully and faithfully accepting it, or by praising the devotional service of others, even persons who hate the demigods and all other living beings can be immediately purified.\" (SB 11.2.12)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat is the power of hearing about pure devotional service and Devananda suffered because he never spoke about pure devotional service even though he read Srimad Bhagavatam and spoke from it every single day. Lord Caitanya knew that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome time later, when Lord Caitanya was wandering through Navadvipa, He walked by Devananda Pandit’s asrama. He remembered what goes on there and what happened to Srivasa. He said, \"In there is a person who never glorifies pure devotional service. He doesn’t know the glories of Srimad Bhagavatam. Srimad Bhagavatam is pure nectar. The four Vedas are like yoghurt and Srimad Bhagavatam is like butter. Sukadeva Goswami churned this yoghurt into butter and Pariksit Maharaja relished it. But this rascal thinks he speaks from Bhagavatam!\" The Lord became very, very angry. He wanted to run in there and rip up Bhagavatam but the devotees stopped Him. \"No, no, please, don’t do that.\" The devotees were relishing seeing His anger but they had to stop Him. They didn’t want Him to go that far.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne time again when Lord Caitanya was wandering through Navadvipa, along with Srivasa, He saw Devananda walking and approached him. He had really some strong words to say to him. He said, \"Devananda, you are a rascal! You speak from Srimad Bhagavatam but you never glorify pure devotional service. Do you know that Srivasa Thakura came into your assembly? Srivasa Thakura is such a pure devotee who relishes the topics of pure devotional service that even the Ganges descends from the spiritual world to take his darshan. And you didn’t say anything when your students removed him from your presence.\" Lord Caitanya chastised him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe important point, however, is that Devananda Pandit listened. He got some mercy, went home and thought about it. While he was thinking, he was feeling very distressed. Vrindavana das Thakura said that the reason why he was so distressed was due to his bad association.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWho was that bad association? In his commentary, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura explains that his bad association were his students. They had no interest in hearing about pure devotional service, because Devananda Pandit never spoke to them about it. Hence they were all materialistic and also the cause of his own distress.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, there’s a wonderful ending to this pastime. Devananda accepted this chastisement though it still took him time to fully digest it. He then received the mercy of a great devotee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter Lord Caitanya took sannyasa, Vakresvara Pandit came to Devananda’s asrama. Vakresvara Pandit was like one of the swans, bees, or ducks who relishes the loud kirtan, singing and dancing the Holy name of the Lord. The word used here is utkirtana, loud chanting – he was always absorbed in loud chanting, singing and dancing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevananda Pandit became very attracted to Vakresvara Pandit and began thinking of ways he could render service to him. But because Vakresvara Pandit was always so absorbed, there was no way how he could ask him, \"What can I do to serve you?\" Devananda noticed that in his ecstasy, Vakresvara Pandit sometimes would fall to the ground. Devananda Pandit would be there to catch him whenever he would fall. He would stand around, watch and guard him very carefully. One time when Vakresvara Pandit was falling, Devananda Pandit was there to catch him, took the dust off Vakresvara Pandit's body and began smearing it on his own body. By rendering service to this devotee he finally began to understand the glories of Lord Caitanya .\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPreviously, although Devananda Pandit saw Lord Caitanya he didn’t recognize the Lord's glories. But now having seen and having served this devotee, he was able to understand the glories of Lord Caitanya .&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this connection Vrindavana das Thakura quotes one verse:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"There may be a doubt whether the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will attain perfection, but there is absolutely no doubt that those who are attached to serving the Lord's devotees will attain perfection.\" (Govinda-bhasya, 3.3.51)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs a result of the service he rendered to Vakresvara Pandit, Devananda Pandit was able to get the mercy of Lord Caitanya.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe next time he saw Lord Caitanya was in Kuliya. He approached Him and begged the Lord for His forgiveness. He said, \"I am a fool. Previously everyone thought I was knowledgeable. I would speak from Srimad Bhagavatam. But I don’t know anything about Srimad Bhagavatam. Please instruct me how I should speak from Bhagavatam.\" Lord Caitanya instructed, \"Srimad Bhagavatam, at the beginning, middle, end – any way you open it up, only glorifies pure devotional service. Never speak about anything else but pure devotional service. And then you can speak from Srimad Bhagavatam.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe understand from this pastime, which is like a nectar-flowing river, the significance of hearing and relishing the topics about the Lord and His pure devotees. Even though we may not fully understand them, even though we may not be able to fully comprehend the mercy of the Lord and His kindness to His devotees, and even though we may not be pure, if we hear about pure devotional service, speak about it, remember it, meditate on it, if we are respectful towards devotional service and praise the devotional service rendered by others, our hearts will become pure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the greatest need for the hankering soul. None of the other topics Srila Prabhupada mentioned in his purport today [art, culture, sociology, etc.] can fulfill the need of the soul. Having once heard and understood the nature of such transcendental topics, one should be very careful. One who knows what pure devotional service is and how the glorification of pure devotional service can serve the needs of everyone, should not neglectful, and therefore touched by the offense of not removing the scarcity of pure devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna.

Do you know why you felt this way? Because while you were reading Srimad Bhagavatam, I entered your heart. Because I entered your heart, you experienced such ecstatic love that you had never experienced before. Do you remember when that took place, Srivasa?\" Of course, Srivasa remembered and understood that the Lord was so kind.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this connection, I would like to read one verse Vrndavana das Thakur wrote within the context of this pastime and a small but very relevant commentary from Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Devananda did not stop them. As the guru was ignorant, so were his disciples.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Commentary]\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the students under the shelter of Devananda, their teacher, could not understand the fruits of Srivasa's devotional service, they committed offenses at the feet of Srivasa because they were controlled by their material perception. Because the teacher, Devananda, did not check the actions of his ignorant students, he was also guilty of the offense. Devananda, who was ignorant of devotional service, gave no information about the exalted position of devotional service in his teachings to his students. Therefore since the guru had no qualification in devotional service, his disciples were also devoid of devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUpon seeing the merciful pure devotees' method of preaching through chanting, many people nowadays say that it is better to worship the Lord at home in solitude. They say various obstacles such as false ego and pride attack one who preaches through chanting. But in this instance, if a person like Devananda Pandita remains ignorant about devotional service and does not preach the glories of devotional service, he commits an offense. This is the purport of this pastime. A scarcity of devotional service is seen in every activity of this world, but if one does not engage in glorifying the Lord to remove that scarcity, he is touched by offense.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami: Very powerful words from the Acharya. He says that there’s a scarcity of glorification of pure devotional service and it’s seen in every activity of this world. If one does not glorify pure devotional service to remove that scarcity, he is influenced by that offence.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada also described in the purport to today’s verse that the soul is hankering, the tongue and ears are hankering, for the flowing river of nectar. In the desert a few drops of water, compared to the topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, etc., cannot satisfy the needs of the soul. The soul cannot be satisfied by a few drops. It needs relief from a flowing river.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Fourth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam Narada Muni states:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and thus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant flow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- namely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" (SB 4.29.39-40)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s what the living entity needs. He needs to transcend the bodily concept of life. The way to transcend the bodily concept of life is to hear the glories of pure devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam it is stated:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Pure devotional service rendered to the Supreme Lord is spiritually so potent that simply by hearing about such transcendental service, by chanting its glories in response, by meditating on it, by respectfully and faithfully accepting it, or by praising the devotional service of others, even persons who hate the demigods and all other living beings can be immediately purified.\" (SB 11.2.12)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is the power of hearing about pure devotional service and Devananda suffered because he never spoke about pure devotional service even though he read Srimad Bhagavatam and spoke from it every single day. Lord Caitanya knew that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSome time later, when Lord Caitanya was wandering through Navadvipa, He walked by Devananda Pandit’s asrama. He remembered what goes on there and what happened to Srivasa. He said, \"In there is a person who never glorifies pure devotional service. He doesn’t know the glories of Srimad Bhagavatam. Srimad Bhagavatam is pure nectar. The four Vedas are like yoghurt and Srimad Bhagavatam is like butter. Sukadeva Goswami churned this yoghurt into butter and Pariksit Maharaja relished it. But this rascal thinks he speaks from Bhagavatam!\" The Lord became very, very angry. He wanted to run in there and rip up Bhagavatam but the devotees stopped Him. \"No, no, please, don’t do that.\" The devotees were relishing seeing His anger but they had to stop Him. They didn’t want Him to go that far.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne time again when Lord Caitanya was wandering through Navadvipa, along with Srivasa, He saw Devananda walking and approached him. He had really some strong words to say to him. He said, \"Devananda, you are a rascal! You speak from Srimad Bhagavatam but you never glorify pure devotional service. Do you know that Srivasa Thakura came into your assembly? Srivasa Thakura is such a pure devotee who relishes the topics of pure devotional service that even the Ganges descends from the spiritual world to take his darshan. And you didn’t say anything when your students removed him from your presence.\" Lord Caitanya chastised him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe important point, however, is that Devananda Pandit listened. He got some mercy, went home and thought about it. While he was thinking, he was feeling very distressed. Vrindavana das Thakura said that the reason why he was so distressed was due to his bad association.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWho was that bad association? In his commentary, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura explains that his bad association were his students. They had no interest in hearing about pure devotional service, because Devananda Pandit never spoke to them about it. Hence they were all materialistic and also the cause of his own distress.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, there’s a wonderful ending to this pastime. Devananda accepted this chastisement though it still took him time to fully digest it. He then received the mercy of a great devotee.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter Lord Caitanya took sannyasa, Vakresvara Pandit came to Devananda’s asrama. Vakresvara Pandit was like one of the swans, bees, or ducks who relishes the loud kirtan, singing and dancing the Holy name of the Lord. The word used here is utkirtana, loud chanting – he was always absorbed in loud chanting, singing and dancing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevananda Pandit became very attracted to Vakresvara Pandit and began thinking of ways he could render service to him. But because Vakresvara Pandit was always so absorbed, there was no way how he could ask him, \"What can I do to serve you?\" Devananda noticed that in his ecstasy, Vakresvara Pandit sometimes would fall to the ground. Devananda Pandit would be there to catch him whenever he would fall. He would stand around, watch and guard him very carefully. One time when Vakresvara Pandit was falling, Devananda Pandit was there to catch him, took the dust off Vakresvara Pandit's body and began smearing it on his own body. By rendering service to this devotee he finally began to understand the glories of Lord Caitanya .\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPreviously, although Devananda Pandit saw Lord Caitanya he didn’t recognize the Lord's glories. But now having seen and having served this devotee, he was able to understand the glories of Lord Caitanya . \n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this connection Vrindavana das Thakura quotes one verse:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"There may be a doubt whether the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will attain perfection, but there is absolutely no doubt that those who are attached to serving the Lord's devotees will attain perfection.\" (Govinda-bhasya, 3.3.51)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a result of the service he rendered to Vakresvara Pandit, Devananda Pandit was able to get the mercy of Lord Caitanya.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe next time he saw Lord Caitanya was in Kuliya. He approached Him and begged the Lord for His forgiveness. He said, \"I am a fool. Previously everyone thought I was knowledgeable. I would speak from Srimad Bhagavatam. But I don’t know anything about Srimad Bhagavatam. Please instruct me how I should speak from Bhagavatam.\" Lord Caitanya instructed, \"Srimad Bhagavatam, at the beginning, middle, end – any way you open it up, only glorifies pure devotional service. Never speak about anything else but pure devotional service. And then you can speak from Srimad Bhagavatam.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe understand from this pastime, which is like a nectar-flowing river, the significance of hearing and relishing the topics about the Lord and His pure devotees. Even though we may not fully understand them, even though we may not be able to fully comprehend the mercy of the Lord and His kindness to His devotees, and even though we may not be pure, if we hear about pure devotional service, speak about it, remember it, meditate on it, if we are respectful towards devotional service and praise the devotional service rendered by others, our hearts will become pure.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the greatest need for the hankering soul. None of the other topics Srila Prabhupada mentioned in his purport today [art, culture, sociology, etc.] can fulfill the need of the soul. Having once heard and understood the nature of such transcendental topics, one should be very careful. One who knows what pure devotional service is and how the glorification of pure devotional service can serve the needs of everyone, should not neglectful, and therefore touched by the offense of not removing the scarcity of pure devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna. Jaya Prabhupada!\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is an edited transcription of an evening talk given on October 9, 2014, in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on Srimad Bhagavatam 10.9.19, at the beginning Kartika.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOctober 9, 2014 - Almaty - Lecture on Damodara Lila\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI have been asked to speak this evening. Since we are beginning Kartika, I thought it would be appropriate to read a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, 10th Canto, Chapter 9, entitled \"Mother Yasoda binds Lord Krishna.\" This month is also known as the month of Damodara and is therefore a good opportunity to meditate on Damodara-lila. This very wonderful pastime displays the potency of mother Yasoda’s pure love for her son.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrishna is known by His quality of being controlled by the love of His devotee. This particular pastime of Mother Yasoda binding her son is the perfect display of how the Lord is bound by this love. In fact Yasoda’s very name…Yasa means fame and da means giver; she is the giver of fame. So by this very pastime, she is increasing Krishna’s fame, which is known throughout the entire three worlds as one who is controlled by the love of His devotees. This pastime is a very wonderful display of how the devotee's love defeats the Lord by making the Lord a plaything in the hand of His devotee. It is also a very wonderful display of His mercy potency, His kripa-sakti, because by His mercy, which He bestows upon His devotee, He allows His devotees to defeat Him by their love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this pastime, we see something unique. We generally do not hear about the Lord waiting for somebody else’s judgment. The way most people think of the Lord is as the supreme judge; since it is ultimately He who creates the laws of the material nature and everyone else is subject to those laws. But it is rare to hear about the Lord waiting for somebody else’s judgment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMother Yasoda contemplated on whether she should free her son, letting Him do whatever He wanted to do, or whether she should bind her son. Krishna was left standing there, waiting for her to pass her judgment. He had to wait for her decision on what would be His fate. This is an example of how the Supreme Personality of Godhead subordinates Himself to the will of His devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that when there is competition between the devotee and the Lord, the devotee’s will oftentimes prevails. Therefore we see in this pastime how the will of mother Yasoda prevailed over her son, and how she was able to defeat Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo there is a verse in Srimad Bhagavatam, which speaks a little bit about this. This verse has a very wonderful commentary by Srila Prabhupada. So I’d like to read it. It's from the 10th Canto, 9th Chapter, verse 19.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tevam sandarsita hy anga<br />\r\n\tharina bhrtya-vasyata<br />\r\n\tsva-vasenapi krsnena<br />\r\n\tyasyedam sesvaram vase\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"O Mahārāja Parīksit, this entire universe, with its great, exalted demigods like Lord Siva, Lord Brahma and Lord Indra, is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet the Supreme Lord has one transcendental attribute: He comes under the control of His devotee. This was now exhibited by Krishna in this pastime.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis pastime of Krsna's is very difficult to understand, but devotees can understand it. It is therefore said, darsayams tad-vidam loka atmano bhakta-vasyatam (SB 10.11.9): the Lord displays the transcendental attribute of coming under the control of His devotees. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.35):\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teko 'py asau racayitum jagad-anda-kotim<br />\r\n\tyac-chaktir asti jagad-anda-caya yad-antah<br />\r\n\tandantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham<br />\r\n\tgovindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy His one plenary portion as Paramatma, the Lord controls innumerable universes, with all their demigods; yet He agrees to be controlled by a devotee. In the Upanisads it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can run with more speed than the mind, but here we see that although Krsna wanted to avoid being arrested by His mother, He was finally defeated, and Mother Yasoda captured Him. Laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam: [Bs. 5.29] Krsna is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Nonetheless, He steals butter like one who is poverty-stricken. Yamaraja, the controller of all living entities, fears the order of Krsna, yet Krsna is afraid of His mother's stick. These contradictions cannot be understood by one who is not a devotee, but a devotee can understand how powerful is unalloyed devotional service to Krsna; it is so powerful that Krsna can be controlled by an unalloyed devotee. This bhrtya-vasyata does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant's pure love. In Bhagavad-gita (1.21) it is said that Krsna became the chariot driver of Arjuna. Arjuna ordered Him, senayor ubhayor madhye ratham sthapaya me 'cyuta: \"My dear Krsna, You have agreed to be my charioteer and to execute my orders. Place my chariot between the two armies of soldiers.\" Krsna immediately executed this order, and therefore one may argue that Krsna also is not independent. But this is one's ajnana, ignorance. Krsna is always fully independent; when He becomes subordinate to His devotees, this is a display of ananda-cinmaya-rasa, the humor of transcendental qualities that increases His transcendental pleasure. Everyone worships Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller can be no one else but a pure devotee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI do not know how I should organize this. On one hand I have been told that both of you [B.B. Govinda Swami and Caitanya Candra Caran Prabhu] are going to speak. On the other hand, both of you are telling me to speak. I am ready to speak but I don't want to speak in such a way that I disappoint the devotees by not giving adequate time for both of you to speak. So since Govinda Maharaja controls me by his affection, I'll have to accept whatever he orders me to do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGovinda Maharaja: \"Speak\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI am ready to speak but when should I stop? I should go on? (laughs) But you are very tired and you want to leave. (Speaks to Govinda Maharaja) He's tired from his long travel to Almaty and he wants to leave as early as possible. So I will not go too long. Anyways, I will speak a little bit and then we will see what happens.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere in the commentary Srila Prabhupada brings some very important points to light, that only a devotee can understand the Lord’s pastimes. To a non-devotee, the Lord's pastimes may seem to be very contradictory and this pastime manifests a lot of contradictions for a person looking for them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor instance, the Supreme Lord is known, as atmarama. By His very nature He is self-satisfied. But this whole pastime begins because the Lord is very hungry. In other words, If the Lord is self-satisfied, how is it that He is hungry? And not only that… He is the personification of peace and pure goodness. When His hunger is not sufficiently satisfied, He becomes angry. Another contradiction. ... He is supposed to be self-satisfied. But here it appears that He is not. He is angry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe is also apta-kama. Apta-kama means that all His desires are fulfilled automatically. Yet, He is very dissatisfied in this pastime and He lets His mother know it. And as Prabhupada brings out in the commentary also, that the Supreme Lord is the master of the goddess of fortune. The Goddess of fortune bestows all kinds of benedictions. He is the master of unlimited goddesses of fortune. Simply by His thinking, He can manifest unlimited fortune. Yet He behaves like a beggar, so much so that He has to steal butter. This is beyond one’s imagination. This is definitely a contradiction for someone who is looking for one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrishna instills fear in everyone through time and by death. Yet, although all living beings throughout creation live with this fear, which is controlled by Krishna, He is running away in fear from His mother who is shaking a stick at Him… and He is really afraid.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrishna can travel at the speed of mind; He can travel even faster than the speed of the mind, yet His mother captures Him and keeps Him in her grip.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother example… Krishna is sandrananda, which means that He is the full manifestation of condensed bliss. So how is it that the full manifestation of condensed bliss cries in a sorrowful mood?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrishna is unlimited, all-pervading. He says, \"By Me, in this unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.\" But although He is unlimited and all-pervading, He is limited by being tied up by His mother. Figure it out. And if we try to reconcile these contradictions from an external point of view, worldly-minded people could find all the excuses they wanted to not to surrender to Krishna. How can you surrender to somebody who’s very existence is full of contradictions?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose who are inclined to look for contradictions will use them to justify their unwillingness to surrender. It's human nature. We scrutinize those who tell us to do something. The first thing we do is check, \"Are they doing it?\" The nature of the conditioned mind is to look for contradictions. The ability to surrender comes by having firm faith in the Absolute Truth in Whom there are no contradictions. Otherwise how can one have absolute faith if one sees too many contradictions?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTaking all of these contradictions into consideration, Srila Prabhupada in his commentary makes it very clear that only a devotee can reconcile all of these contradictions because he knows what is the greatest of all the Lord's qualities. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes the quality of bhakta-vatsalya as the emperor of all the Lord’s qualities, because it is this quality which can reconcile all contradictions. The Lord is controlled by the love of His pure devotees. He allows Himself to become defeated by their love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada makes this point very clear in his commentary. When he translates the word bhrtya-vasyata, he says,&nbsp; \"This bhrtya-vasyata does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant's pure love.\" He makes this distinction. Just like Krishna tells Uddhava:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tna sādhayati māṁ yogo<br />\r\n\tna sāṅkhyaṁ dharma uddhava<br />\r\n\t(SB 11.14.20)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe said, \"Unalloyed devotional service rendered unto Me by My devotee brings Me under his control.\" He says, \"I cannot be controlled by austerities nor by the study of sankhya, nor by mystic yoga. None of these things bring Me under control, only unalloyed devotional service.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Srila Prabhupada speaks about this often and here he is elaborating on this point in this commentary.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn one lecture Srila Prabhupada gave in 1966, he was explaining that by worshiping Krishna, one can become even greater than Krishna. He said, \"Everybody comes to Krishna asking something from Krishna, ‘Oh Krishna, please give me this, give me that,' because everyone thinks that Krishna is the Supreme controller, proprietor and possessor of everything. But a devotee thinks, 'Krishna is dependent on me. If I don't feed Him, how will He eat?' Therefore a devotee can take a position even greater than Krishna.\"<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada also makes that point here in this commentary. He said, \"Everyone worships Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller could be no one else but a pure devotee.\" In other words, Krishna is Bhagavan. He is the possessor of all opulences; the most wealthy, the most powerful, the most intelligent, the most beautiful, the most famous, and the most renounced. Those who worship Supreme Lord as Bhagavan, generally want something from Him. Therefore Prabhupada says, \"Sometimes Krishna desires to be controlled by someone else.\" This is how He enjoys. The Supreme Lord experiences great pleasure by being controlled by His devotee’s pure love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore we see here in this pastime, how mother Yasoda gives Krishna great pleasure. She gives Krishna pleasure because she thinks that He is her son, He is dependent on her, and she has to teach Him a lesson. Sometimes a mother has to teach her child a lesson by punishing the child. When the child misbehaves, the mother has to take a very strong position. In this pastime, Krishna is being chastised by His mother.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt all started when mother Yasoda was churning some yogurt into butter. She was churning some very special milk which she personally gathered herself. Someone may wonder, \"She is the queen of Vrindavana, why did she have to churn the yogurt into butter? She had so many maidservants who could do it for her.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey could all do it, but she wanted to personally do it. She selected the finest milk for Krishna, milk collected from the cows who were grazing on the grasses of Govardhana. This grass was especially aromatic. She was thinking, \"My son leaves home to steal butter from other’s homes. Therefore I have to make the best butter so that He will be satisfied with what I provide for Him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo she was churning the yogurt from this milk into butter. It was early in the morning before Krishna had awaken. She knew that it would be very difficult to do it when Krishna was awake because Krishna was always trying to get her attention. But on this particular morning, while she was churning the yogurt, Krishna awoke. He was thinking, \"My mother is not here. She must be doing something else\", because usually she is there whenever He wakes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Krishna went to search out His mother. He found her churning the yogurt into butter and Krishna, as we all know, was feeling hungry. Why is the Lord is hungry if He is fully self-satisfied. Is He really hungry? Yes, because He is hungry for prema. He is hungry for Yasoda’s love. He is very hungry to satisfy mother Yasoda’s desire to offer what she can offer to satisfy Him. So therefore He was thinking, \"My mother is very busy now, churning this yogurt into butter. Let me get her attention. So He came and put His hand on the churning rod, trying to get her to stop.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe acaryas give an explanation of what Krishna was trying to do. The impersonalists, are always churning different philosophies in their minds in an attempt to understand the Supreme. In this way, their minds are constantly churning and churning, churning and churning. Just like Lord Brahma, in his prayer to Krishna he says, \"Such persons are like persons who beat an empty husk of wheat to get the grain. All they get is their hard labor.\" There is no grain in an empty husk of wheat. So people who speculate, who continuously churn and churn and churn to try to understand the Supreme, they are like such persons who beat an empty husk of wheat. The only fruit they get is their hard labor. Krishna can never be understood by such a churning process.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Krishna grabbed the churning rod to suggest to mother Yasoda, \"You already have Me, why do you have to waste your time churning? You already possess Me by your love.\" But Mother Yasoda understood that Krishna wanted to be breastfed. So she then took her child in her lap and offered her breast milk to satisfy His hunger. While she was feeding Him, there was a pot of milk that was on the stove that began boiling over.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo some people may wonder, \"Why did mother Yasoda decide to put Krishna down for just a small pot of milk?\" Nanda Maharaja possesses nine hundred thousand cows and there is no lack of milk. And she had her son on her lap and she was offering her milk to Him. But still she decided to save that pot of milk. So as we said, that pot of milk was special. It was personally selected milk and her meditation was that it was for Krishna. So the milk on the stove was for Krishna and the milk that she was offering from her breast, it was for Krishna. So both were for Krishna. It was not that she was thinking, \"Oh, I do not want to have to clean up the mess,\" and that is why she was putting Krishna down.\"Someone may think that was Mother Yasoda’s motivation for getting up. But it was not. She was actually thinking…, \"This is special milk for Krishna.\" So her motivation in getting up to get that milk was pure and selfless.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow why was the milk overflowing? Our acaryas also give an explanation for this. The milk was overflowing because the milk was thinking, \"Mother Yasoda is giving all her milk to Krishna. What purpose do I have for living?\" The milk was thinking, … in the spiritual world everything is personified…. So the milk was thinking, \"Mother Yasoda is giving all her milk to Krishna, so then what is the purpose of my existence? Better I just commit suicide and throw myself into the fire!\" So the milk started flowing over the pot in an attempt to commit suicide. So when mother Yasoda put Krishna down to run and stop the milk from overflowing, the milk immediately became embarrassed for what she had done by forcing Yasoda to put Krishna down. The milk then stopped overflowing from the pot and mother Yasoda was able to go back and continue feeding her son.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut, of course, Krishna wasn't there because Krishna became angry. Here we have the personification of pure goodness and peace, but He became angry. He became angry to give pleasure to His mother. His whole existence was welling up in anger, but that was also to enhance mother Yasoda’s pleasure. And therefore by manifesting that anger, at that point, He then started to engage in His nefarious activities of breaking open the pot of yogurt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe yogurt started flowing out of the pot. Krishna then ran into the other room and started taking the butter which was hanging in the rafters and began distributing it to the monkeys. Although she was not gone very long, but when Mother Yasoda came back she discovered that Krishna was no longer there and that all the yogurt was all over the ground. She went into the other room and immediately understood that obviously Krishna has to be behind all of this. Everything that has been done here is too calculated to be happening by chance. She was thinking that it must be her mischievous son.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom a distance, Mother Yasoda saw Krishna sitting on top of the wooden grinding mortar, distributing butter to the monkeys. She decided that she had to chastise her son and to punish him. She picked up a stick and Krishna started running in fear. He ran first to the front of the courtyard because He was thinking, \"My mother wants to punish Me with the stick but she won’t do it in public. So better I run out of the yard as quickly as possible so that others will see and then she won’t beat me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrishna was running. He was very calculating. And why was He calculating?...because He wanted to continue to play with His friends. That was His desire. Krishna didn’t want to be punished; He didn’t want to be tied up. And although He knew that mother Yasoda was going to do something like that, He tried to avoid it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo while mother Yasoda was chasing her son with the stick she loudly cried, \"Stop, you thief!\" Krishna responded, \"No, you stop right there! Don’t come any closer!\" He challenged her, \"If you come any closer to me and if you think I am doing mischief now, you wait and see what I will do.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough Krishna is the Supreme Absolute Truth, sometimes He lies. Mother Yasoda would have to hear so many complaints from the local cowherd women such as, \"Your son comes in the morning and steals our butter. Not only does He steal butter, but sometimes He unties the calves so the calves go and drink all the milk from the cows. He does all these mischievous activities, We've come to complain to you about your son Krishna.\" Krishna would stand right there in front of all of them and would then say, \"I don’t know why they are making these lies about Me. I simply go to their homes because I’m attracted to them and to My friends. I don’t do any of these things.\" In this way Supreme Absolute Truth lies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Mother Yasoda knew what Krishna was capable of doing. So Krishna is warning mother Yasoda to stop, \"Don’t go any further.\" Mother Yasoda was then thinking, \"I have to limit my mischievous son’s activities.\" Krishna then started to cry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMother Yasoda became afraid when she saw Krishna crying because she could see that He was really afraid. She therefore put the stick down. She didn’t want Krishna to become more afraid than He already was. But still she wanted to tie him up and began to think, \"I have to restrict Him because He is engaging in so much mischief. I need to teach him a lesson.\" She decided she would tie him to the wooden grinding mortar.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Mother Yasoda took a rope and began to tie up her son. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that when she tried to tie Krishna, Krishna, through his satya-sankalpa sakti manifested His vibhuti-sakti. The satya-sankalpa sakti is the potency of the Lord that fulfills all His desires. And the vibhuti-sakti is His opulence which displays something very wonderful. So the vibhuti-sakti manifested in the rope which was always two fingers too short. As much as Mother Yasoda attempted to tie the rope it was always just two fingers too short.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy this time the other cowherd women came to see what was happening. They tried to suggest to mother Yasoda, \"Maybe you won’t be very successful in tying up your son.\" But Mother Yasoda was very determined and told them, \"No, I’m determined to find the extent of my son’s waist.\" She then asked the other cowherd women, \"Please go and find whatever rope you can find and bring it here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo all the other women brought more ropes for mother Yasoda and she started tying them all together. But every time she tried to bind Him, she was not successful- the rope was always two fingers too short. Krishna didn’t want to be bound up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMother Yasoda was so determined. She manifested what is called \"parisrama.\" Parisrama means - very hard labor. She was laboring so hard to tie up her son that when Krishna saw how hard she was working to tie Him up, His heart melted and became as soft as butter. He manifested His kripa-sakti. The kripa-sakti is this potency that we described before. It is His greatest mercy - it is His greatest opulence. It’s the opulence by which the Lord comes under the control of His devotees' desires. He completely submits His will to the will of His devotee. That’s how He enjoys. He enjoys being controlled by His pure devotee’s love. He doesn’t want to be God all the time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEverybody worships Him as God. But, as Prabhupada says, \"Sometimes the Supreme Lord wants to be controlled by somebody else’s love.\" This means that He doesn’t want to be the supreme controller. He’d rather be controlled. But only a devotee, a pure devotee, can control the Lord. So His mercy potency, His kripa-sakti, manifested, His heart melted, and became soft just like butter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo other important qualities were manifested in this pastime… bhakta-nistha, which was the firm faith of the devotee and sva-nistha, the steady quality of the Lord. The bhakta-nistha was mother Yasoda’s conviction, \"I will tie up my son and punish Him.\" When this bhakta-nistha was manifested then Krishna’s satya-sankalpa sakti and His vibhuti-sakti left and the distance of two fingers was immediately removed. When bhakta-nistha and sva-nistha are present the Lord can be bound. Mother Yasoda made her judgment and the Lord became bound.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, \"In the competition between devotee and the Lord, the devotee's will always prevails. The devotees defeat the Lord by their love. And therefore this pastime of being bound by the ropes of&nbsp; Mother Yasoda is the Damodara-lila, and as we said in the beginning - mother Yasoda’s binding Krishna with this rope of her love as displayed in this pastime is what increases the glories of the Lord. The Lord is famous as being controlled by the love of His devotee and Yasoda -Yasa da - is one who gives fame to the Lord. She spreads the Lords fame by the display of her unalloyed love in defeating her son. And this is the very wonderful and beautiful characteristic of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuch meditations of the Lord are the type of meditations we should we think about especially during this month of Damodara. Such is the power of the love the devotee has over the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are many other details we could explain in this pastime but maybe we can leave them for others to discuss. As I said - I did not want to speak too long. And I thought others, if they wish, could say a few words about Lord Damodara for the pleasure of all the Vaisnavas and for my purification as well. So I should just stop here.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krishna.\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"safe_value": "<p>\n\tThe following is an edited transcription of an evening talk given on October 9, 2014, in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on Srimad Bhagavatam 10.9.19, at the beginning Kartika.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOctober 9, 2014 - Almaty - Lecture on Damodara Lila\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI have been asked to speak this evening. Since we are beginning Kartika, I thought it would be appropriate to read a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, 10th Canto, Chapter 9, entitled \"Mother Yasoda binds Lord Krishna.\" This month is also known as the month of Damodara and is therefore a good opportunity to meditate on Damodara-lila. This very wonderful pastime displays the potency of mother Yasoda’s pure love for her son.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrishna is known by His quality of being controlled by the love of His devotee. This particular pastime of Mother Yasoda binding her son is the perfect display of how the Lord is bound by this love. In fact Yasoda’s very name…Yasa means fame and da means giver; she is the giver of fame. So by this very pastime, she is increasing Krishna’s fame, which is known throughout the entire three worlds as one who is controlled by the love of His devotees. This pastime is a very wonderful display of how the devotee's love defeats the Lord by making the Lord a plaything in the hand of His devotee. It is also a very wonderful display of His mercy potency, His kripa-sakti, because by His mercy, which He bestows upon His devotee, He allows His devotees to defeat Him by their love.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this pastime, we see something unique. We generally do not hear about the Lord waiting for somebody else’s judgment. The way most people think of the Lord is as the supreme judge; since it is ultimately He who creates the laws of the material nature and everyone else is subject to those laws. But it is rare to hear about the Lord waiting for somebody else’s judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMother Yasoda contemplated on whether she should free her son, letting Him do whatever He wanted to do, or whether she should bind her son. Krishna was left standing there, waiting for her to pass her judgment. He had to wait for her decision on what would be His fate. This is an example of how the Supreme Personality of Godhead subordinates Himself to the will of His devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that when there is competition between the devotee and the Lord, the devotee’s will oftentimes prevails. Therefore we see in this pastime how the will of mother Yasoda prevailed over her son, and how she was able to defeat Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is a verse in Srimad Bhagavatam, which speaks a little bit about this. This verse has a very wonderful commentary by Srila Prabhupada. So I’d like to read it. It's from the 10th Canto, 9th Chapter, verse 19.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tevam sandarsita hy anga<br />\n\tharina bhrtya-vasyata<br />\n\tsva-vasenapi krsnena<br />\n\tyasyedam sesvaram vase\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"O Mahārāja Parīksit, this entire universe, with its great, exalted demigods like Lord Siva, Lord Brahma and Lord Indra, is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet the Supreme Lord has one transcendental attribute: He comes under the control of His devotee. This was now exhibited by Krishna in this pastime.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis pastime of Krsna's is very difficult to understand, but devotees can understand it. It is therefore said, darsayams tad-vidam loka atmano bhakta-vasyatam (SB 10.11.9): the Lord displays the transcendental attribute of coming under the control of His devotees. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.35):\n</p>\n<p>\n\teko 'py asau racayitum jagad-anda-kotim<br />\n\tyac-chaktir asti jagad-anda-caya yad-antah<br />\n\tandantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham<br />\n\tgovindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBy His one plenary portion as Paramatma, the Lord controls innumerable universes, with all their demigods; yet He agrees to be controlled by a devotee. In the Upanisads it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can run with more speed than the mind, but here we see that although Krsna wanted to avoid being arrested by His mother, He was finally defeated, and Mother Yasoda captured Him. Laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam: [Bs. 5.29] Krsna is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Nonetheless, He steals butter like one who is poverty-stricken. Yamaraja, the controller of all living entities, fears the order of Krsna, yet Krsna is afraid of His mother's stick. These contradictions cannot be understood by one who is not a devotee, but a devotee can understand how powerful is unalloyed devotional service to Krsna; it is so powerful that Krsna can be controlled by an unalloyed devotee. This bhrtya-vasyata does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant's pure love. In Bhagavad-gita (1.21) it is said that Krsna became the chariot driver of Arjuna. Arjuna ordered Him, senayor ubhayor madhye ratham sthapaya me 'cyuta: \"My dear Krsna, You have agreed to be my charioteer and to execute my orders. Place my chariot between the two armies of soldiers.\" Krsna immediately executed this order, and therefore one may argue that Krsna also is not independent. But this is one's ajnana, ignorance. Krsna is always fully independent; when He becomes subordinate to His devotees, this is a display of ananda-cinmaya-rasa, the humor of transcendental qualities that increases His transcendental pleasure. Everyone worships Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller can be no one else but a pure devotee.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI do not know how I should organize this. On one hand I have been told that both of you [B.B. Govinda Swami and Caitanya Candra Caran Prabhu] are going to speak. On the other hand, both of you are telling me to speak. I am ready to speak but I don't want to speak in such a way that I disappoint the devotees by not giving adequate time for both of you to speak. So since Govinda Maharaja controls me by his affection, I'll have to accept whatever he orders me to do.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGovinda Maharaja: \"Speak\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI am ready to speak but when should I stop? I should go on? (laughs) But you are very tired and you want to leave. (Speaks to Govinda Maharaja) He's tired from his long travel to Almaty and he wants to leave as early as possible. So I will not go too long. Anyways, I will speak a little bit and then we will see what happens.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHere in the commentary Srila Prabhupada brings some very important points to light, that only a devotee can understand the Lord’s pastimes. To a non-devotee, the Lord's pastimes may seem to be very contradictory and this pastime manifests a lot of contradictions for a person looking for them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor instance, the Supreme Lord is known, as atmarama. By His very nature He is self-satisfied. But this whole pastime begins because the Lord is very hungry. In other words, If the Lord is self-satisfied, how is it that He is hungry? And not only that… He is the personification of peace and pure goodness. When His hunger is not sufficiently satisfied, He becomes angry. Another contradiction. ... He is supposed to be self-satisfied. But here it appears that He is not. He is angry.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe is also apta-kama. Apta-kama means that all His desires are fulfilled automatically. Yet, He is very dissatisfied in this pastime and He lets His mother know it. And as Prabhupada brings out in the commentary also, that the Supreme Lord is the master of the goddess of fortune. The Goddess of fortune bestows all kinds of benedictions. He is the master of unlimited goddesses of fortune. Simply by His thinking, He can manifest unlimited fortune. Yet He behaves like a beggar, so much so that He has to steal butter. This is beyond one’s imagination. This is definitely a contradiction for someone who is looking for one.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrishna instills fear in everyone through time and by death. Yet, although all living beings throughout creation live with this fear, which is controlled by Krishna, He is running away in fear from His mother who is shaking a stick at Him… and He is really afraid.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrishna can travel at the speed of mind; He can travel even faster than the speed of the mind, yet His mother captures Him and keeps Him in her grip.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother example… Krishna is sandrananda, which means that He is the full manifestation of condensed bliss. So how is it that the full manifestation of condensed bliss cries in a sorrowful mood?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrishna is unlimited, all-pervading. He says, \"By Me, in this unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.\" But although He is unlimited and all-pervading, He is limited by being tied up by His mother. Figure it out. And if we try to reconcile these contradictions from an external point of view, worldly-minded people could find all the excuses they wanted to not to surrender to Krishna. How can you surrender to somebody who’s very existence is full of contradictions?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThose who are inclined to look for contradictions will use them to justify their unwillingness to surrender. It's human nature. We scrutinize those who tell us to do something. The first thing we do is check, \"Are they doing it?\" The nature of the conditioned mind is to look for contradictions. The ability to surrender comes by having firm faith in the Absolute Truth in Whom there are no contradictions. Otherwise how can one have absolute faith if one sees too many contradictions?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTaking all of these contradictions into consideration, Srila Prabhupada in his commentary makes it very clear that only a devotee can reconcile all of these contradictions because he knows what is the greatest of all the Lord's qualities. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes the quality of bhakta-vatsalya as the emperor of all the Lord’s qualities, because it is this quality which can reconcile all contradictions. The Lord is controlled by the love of His pure devotees. He allows Himself to become defeated by their love.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada makes this point very clear in his commentary. When he translates the word bhrtya-vasyata, he says,  \"This bhrtya-vasyata does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant's pure love.\" He makes this distinction. Just like Krishna tells Uddhava:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tna sādhayati māṁ yogo<br />\n\tna sāṅkhyaṁ dharma uddhava<br />\n\t(SB 11.14.20)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said, \"Unalloyed devotional service rendered unto Me by My devotee brings Me under his control.\" He says, \"I cannot be controlled by austerities nor by the study of sankhya, nor by mystic yoga. None of these things bring Me under control, only unalloyed devotional service.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Srila Prabhupada speaks about this often and here he is elaborating on this point in this commentary.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn one lecture Srila Prabhupada gave in 1966, he was explaining that by worshiping Krishna, one can become even greater than Krishna. He said, \"Everybody comes to Krishna asking something from Krishna, ‘Oh Krishna, please give me this, give me that,' because everyone thinks that Krishna is the Supreme controller, proprietor and possessor of everything. But a devotee thinks, 'Krishna is dependent on me. If I don't feed Him, how will He eat?' Therefore a devotee can take a position even greater than Krishna.\"<br />\n\tPrabhupada also makes that point here in this commentary. He said, \"Everyone worships Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller could be no one else but a pure devotee.\" In other words, Krishna is Bhagavan. He is the possessor of all opulences; the most wealthy, the most powerful, the most intelligent, the most beautiful, the most famous, and the most renounced. Those who worship Supreme Lord as Bhagavan, generally want something from Him. Therefore Prabhupada says, \"Sometimes Krishna desires to be controlled by someone else.\" This is how He enjoys. The Supreme Lord experiences great pleasure by being controlled by His devotee’s pure love.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore we see here in this pastime, how mother Yasoda gives Krishna great pleasure. She gives Krishna pleasure because she thinks that He is her son, He is dependent on her, and she has to teach Him a lesson. Sometimes a mother has to teach her child a lesson by punishing the child. When the child misbehaves, the mother has to take a very strong position. In this pastime, Krishna is being chastised by His mother.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt all started when mother Yasoda was churning some yogurt into butter. She was churning some very special milk which she personally gathered herself. Someone may wonder, \"She is the queen of Vrindavana, why did she have to churn the yogurt into butter? She had so many maidservants who could do it for her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThey could all do it, but she wanted to personally do it. She selected the finest milk for Krishna, milk collected from the cows who were grazing on the grasses of Govardhana. This grass was especially aromatic. She was thinking, \"My son leaves home to steal butter from other’s homes. Therefore I have to make the best butter so that He will be satisfied with what I provide for Him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo she was churning the yogurt from this milk into butter. It was early in the morning before Krishna had awaken. She knew that it would be very difficult to do it when Krishna was awake because Krishna was always trying to get her attention. But on this particular morning, while she was churning the yogurt, Krishna awoke. He was thinking, \"My mother is not here. She must be doing something else\", because usually she is there whenever He wakes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Krishna went to search out His mother. He found her churning the yogurt into butter and Krishna, as we all know, was feeling hungry. Why is the Lord is hungry if He is fully self-satisfied. Is He really hungry? Yes, because He is hungry for prema. He is hungry for Yasoda’s love. He is very hungry to satisfy mother Yasoda’s desire to offer what she can offer to satisfy Him. So therefore He was thinking, \"My mother is very busy now, churning this yogurt into butter. Let me get her attention. So He came and put His hand on the churning rod, trying to get her to stop.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe acaryas give an explanation of what Krishna was trying to do. The impersonalists, are always churning different philosophies in their minds in an attempt to understand the Supreme. In this way, their minds are constantly churning and churning, churning and churning. Just like Lord Brahma, in his prayer to Krishna he says, \"Such persons are like persons who beat an empty husk of wheat to get the grain. All they get is their hard labor.\" There is no grain in an empty husk of wheat. So people who speculate, who continuously churn and churn and churn to try to understand the Supreme, they are like such persons who beat an empty husk of wheat. The only fruit they get is their hard labor. Krishna can never be understood by such a churning process.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Krishna grabbed the churning rod to suggest to mother Yasoda, \"You already have Me, why do you have to waste your time churning? You already possess Me by your love.\" But Mother Yasoda understood that Krishna wanted to be breastfed. So she then took her child in her lap and offered her breast milk to satisfy His hunger. While she was feeding Him, there was a pot of milk that was on the stove that began boiling over.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo some people may wonder, \"Why did mother Yasoda decide to put Krishna down for just a small pot of milk?\" Nanda Maharaja possesses nine hundred thousand cows and there is no lack of milk. And she had her son on her lap and she was offering her milk to Him. But still she decided to save that pot of milk. So as we said, that pot of milk was special. It was personally selected milk and her meditation was that it was for Krishna. So the milk on the stove was for Krishna and the milk that she was offering from her breast, it was for Krishna. So both were for Krishna. It was not that she was thinking, \"Oh, I do not want to have to clean up the mess,\" and that is why she was putting Krishna down.\"Someone may think that was Mother Yasoda’s motivation for getting up. But it was not. She was actually thinking…, \"This is special milk for Krishna.\" So her motivation in getting up to get that milk was pure and selfless.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNow why was the milk overflowing? Our acaryas also give an explanation for this. The milk was overflowing because the milk was thinking, \"Mother Yasoda is giving all her milk to Krishna. What purpose do I have for living?\" The milk was thinking, … in the spiritual world everything is personified…. So the milk was thinking, \"Mother Yasoda is giving all her milk to Krishna, so then what is the purpose of my existence? Better I just commit suicide and throw myself into the fire!\" So the milk started flowing over the pot in an attempt to commit suicide. So when mother Yasoda put Krishna down to run and stop the milk from overflowing, the milk immediately became embarrassed for what she had done by forcing Yasoda to put Krishna down. The milk then stopped overflowing from the pot and mother Yasoda was able to go back and continue feeding her son.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, of course, Krishna wasn't there because Krishna became angry. Here we have the personification of pure goodness and peace, but He became angry. He became angry to give pleasure to His mother. His whole existence was welling up in anger, but that was also to enhance mother Yasoda’s pleasure. And therefore by manifesting that anger, at that point, He then started to engage in His nefarious activities of breaking open the pot of yogurt.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe yogurt started flowing out of the pot. Krishna then ran into the other room and started taking the butter which was hanging in the rafters and began distributing it to the monkeys. Although she was not gone very long, but when Mother Yasoda came back she discovered that Krishna was no longer there and that all the yogurt was all over the ground. She went into the other room and immediately understood that obviously Krishna has to be behind all of this. Everything that has been done here is too calculated to be happening by chance. She was thinking that it must be her mischievous son.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom a distance, Mother Yasoda saw Krishna sitting on top of the wooden grinding mortar, distributing butter to the monkeys. She decided that she had to chastise her son and to punish him. She picked up a stick and Krishna started running in fear. He ran first to the front of the courtyard because He was thinking, \"My mother wants to punish Me with the stick but she won’t do it in public. So better I run out of the yard as quickly as possible so that others will see and then she won’t beat me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrishna was running. He was very calculating. And why was He calculating?...because He wanted to continue to play with His friends. That was His desire. Krishna didn’t want to be punished; He didn’t want to be tied up. And although He knew that mother Yasoda was going to do something like that, He tried to avoid it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo while mother Yasoda was chasing her son with the stick she loudly cried, \"Stop, you thief!\" Krishna responded, \"No, you stop right there! Don’t come any closer!\" He challenged her, \"If you come any closer to me and if you think I am doing mischief now, you wait and see what I will do.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough Krishna is the Supreme Absolute Truth, sometimes He lies. Mother Yasoda would have to hear so many complaints from the local cowherd women such as, \"Your son comes in the morning and steals our butter. Not only does He steal butter, but sometimes He unties the calves so the calves go and drink all the milk from the cows. He does all these mischievous activities, We've come to complain to you about your son Krishna.\" Krishna would stand right there in front of all of them and would then say, \"I don’t know why they are making these lies about Me. I simply go to their homes because I’m attracted to them and to My friends. I don’t do any of these things.\" In this way Supreme Absolute Truth lies.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Mother Yasoda knew what Krishna was capable of doing. So Krishna is warning mother Yasoda to stop, \"Don’t go any further.\" Mother Yasoda was then thinking, \"I have to limit my mischievous son’s activities.\" Krishna then started to cry.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMother Yasoda became afraid when she saw Krishna crying because she could see that He was really afraid. She therefore put the stick down. She didn’t want Krishna to become more afraid than He already was. But still she wanted to tie him up and began to think, \"I have to restrict Him because He is engaging in so much mischief. I need to teach him a lesson.\" She decided she would tie him to the wooden grinding mortar.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Mother Yasoda took a rope and began to tie up her son. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that when she tried to tie Krishna, Krishna, through his satya-sankalpa sakti manifested His vibhuti-sakti. The satya-sankalpa sakti is the potency of the Lord that fulfills all His desires. And the vibhuti-sakti is His opulence which displays something very wonderful. So the vibhuti-sakti manifested in the rope which was always two fingers too short. As much as Mother Yasoda attempted to tie the rope it was always just two fingers too short.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBy this time the other cowherd women came to see what was happening. They tried to suggest to mother Yasoda, \"Maybe you won’t be very successful in tying up your son.\" But Mother Yasoda was very determined and told them, \"No, I’m determined to find the extent of my son’s waist.\" She then asked the other cowherd women, \"Please go and find whatever rope you can find and bring it here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo all the other women brought more ropes for mother Yasoda and she started tying them all together. But every time she tried to bind Him, she was not successful- the rope was always two fingers too short. Krishna didn’t want to be bound up.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMother Yasoda was so determined. She manifested what is called \"parisrama.\" Parisrama means - very hard labor. She was laboring so hard to tie up her son that when Krishna saw how hard she was working to tie Him up, His heart melted and became as soft as butter. He manifested His kripa-sakti. The kripa-sakti is this potency that we described before. It is His greatest mercy - it is His greatest opulence. It’s the opulence by which the Lord comes under the control of His devotees' desires. He completely submits His will to the will of His devotee. That’s how He enjoys. He enjoys being controlled by His pure devotee’s love. He doesn’t want to be God all the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEverybody worships Him as God. But, as Prabhupada says, \"Sometimes the Supreme Lord wants to be controlled by somebody else’s love.\" This means that He doesn’t want to be the supreme controller. He’d rather be controlled. But only a devotee, a pure devotee, can control the Lord. So His mercy potency, His kripa-sakti, manifested, His heart melted, and became soft just like butter.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo other important qualities were manifested in this pastime… bhakta-nistha, which was the firm faith of the devotee and sva-nistha, the steady quality of the Lord. The bhakta-nistha was mother Yasoda’s conviction, \"I will tie up my son and punish Him.\" When this bhakta-nistha was manifested then Krishna’s satya-sankalpa sakti and His vibhuti-sakti left and the distance of two fingers was immediately removed. When bhakta-nistha and sva-nistha are present the Lord can be bound. Mother Yasoda made her judgment and the Lord became bound.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, \"In the competition between devotee and the Lord, the devotee's will always prevails. The devotees defeat the Lord by their love. And therefore this pastime of being bound by the ropes of  Mother Yasoda is the Damodara-lila, and as we said in the beginning - mother Yasoda’s binding Krishna with this rope of her love as displayed in this pastime is what increases the glories of the Lord. The Lord is famous as being controlled by the love of His devotee and Yasoda -Yasa da - is one who gives fame to the Lord. She spreads the Lords fame by the display of her unalloyed love in defeating her son. And this is the very wonderful and beautiful characteristic of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSuch meditations of the Lord are the type of meditations we should we think about especially during this month of Damodara. Such is the power of the love the devotee has over the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are many other details we could explain in this pastime but maybe we can leave them for others to discuss. As I said - I did not want to speak too long. And I thought others, if they wish, could say a few words about Lord Damodara for the pleasure of all the Vaisnavas and for my purification as well. So I should just stop here.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krishna.\n</p>\n",

Reflecting on their deep meaning, I momentarily thought of my past when there was never a thought of Krsna in my life, no Bhagavad-gita, and no Srila Prabhupada to guide me. Contrasting those memories with my life as it is now, I became overcome with a mixture of emotions. Foremost among them was gratitude, but then a bewildering question arose in my mind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"How is it possible for anyone to survive in this world without knowing that it's only by remembering Krsna that we can solve the problems of life?\" At that moment I simply could not conceive how a living being, with a consciousness developed enough to be called human, could survive by clinging on to the fallible and futile conception that there was a shelter in this world other than that which comes from remembering Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, there's always \"temporary relief\", and the storehouse of solutions available under this heading is filled with an unlimited supply. \"Try heat for relief of the cold. Try cold for relief of the heat. Try food for relief of the hunger. Try intoxication for the relief of having to cope. Try speculation for relief of the unknown. Try this and try that\"… there is no end to the list of placebos. And those who look only for relief will forever get the opportunity to go on looking for more and more. Why? Because relief cannot fully satisfy the hankering soul. Unfortunately for them, they never learned that life has so much more to offer than the search for relief. Due to their misfortune, they were never able to hear you.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada, somehow, by some stroke of good fortune, something which I still cannot fully comprehend even today, you intervened into my life. You taught me that shelter is not the same as relief. Sure, as you had written… remembering Krsna brings relief from all kinds of mental agonies and remembering Krsna is also the way out of great entanglements which may embarrass us in some critical hour. But what you showed me and anyone else willing to have their eyes opened with your torchlight of knowledge, is that remembering Krsna is the natural state of existence and our only shelter in life. And the best way for me to remember Krsna is to cling to your instructions and eternally serve under the shelter of your divine lotus feet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. There is another personality who has captured my mind and who has been indelibly implanted within the core of my heart. For me, remembrance of you is nondifferent than remembrance of Krsna. You are the Lord, master, and proprietor of my heart. It was you who saved me from the hell where there was no thought of Krsna, no Bhagavad-gita, and no…. I can't even say it. You were there, but I had not as yet heard what you were saying.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThank you Srila Prabhupada. My debt to you is incalculable and will never be able to be repaid.

Then the devotee is established in goodness, and he becomes completely happy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA living being in his normal constitutional position is fully satisfied in spiritual bliss. This state of existence is called brahma-bhūta or atmananda, or the state of self-satisfaction. This self-satisfaction is not like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorance, whereas the self-satisfied atmanandi is transcendental to the material state of existence. This stage of perfection is attained as soon as one is fixed in irrevocable devotional service. Devotional service is not inactivity, but the unalloyed activity of the soul.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe soul’s activity becomes adulterated in contact with matter, and as such the diseased activities are expressed in the form of lust, desire, hankering, inactivity, foolishness and sleep. The effect of devotional service becomes manifest by complete elimination of these effects of passion and ignorance. The devotee is fixed at once in the mode of goodness, and he makes further progress to rise to the position of vasudeva, or the state of unmixed sattva, or suddha-sattva. Only in this suddha-sattva state can one always see Krishna face to face by dint of pure affection for the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA devotee is always in the mode of unalloyed goodness; therefore he harms no one. But the nondevotee, however educated he may be, is always harmful. A devotee is neither foolish nor passionate. The harmful, foolish and passionate cannot be devotees of the Lord, however they may advertise themselves as devotees by outward dress. A devotee is always qualified with all the good qualities of God. Quantitatively such qualifications may be different, but qualitatively both the Lord and His devotee are one and the same.<br />\r\n\t(SB 1.2.19)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we are reading some very important verses from Srimad Bhagavatam. These verses describe the cleansing of the heart by devotional service, and how obstacles are removed from the heart for those who engage in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord in the association of devotees. In this verse today, the Srimad Bhagavatam is explaining how one comes to the platform of nistha, or steadiness in devotional service, and some of the symptoms of one who is situated on this platform.&nbsp; One who is on this platform is not affected by the modes of material nature. It is important to understand that there may be some trace of the modes of material nature even for one who is situated on this platform, but the point is that one is not influenced by them, and this is established here by the words ceta etair anaviddham, which means that one is not affected in the mind by these.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada, I remember, used an example of how a devotee is one who stays in the boat of devotional service. If one is crossing the ocean and there is a lot of disturbance in the middle of the ocean, with so many waves, as long as one stays in the boat, though he will be influenced by the waves, at least he is not in the waves themselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is one thing to be drowning in the waves in the middle of the ocean, but it is another thing to be in the boat. In other words, although one may be influenced by those waves in the boat, rocking back and forth, still one is in the boat. Srila Prabhupada said that to stay in the boat means that one should strictly follow the regulative principles of Krishna consciousness. This is what keeps us in the boat as opposed to jumping ship. If one jumps ship, there is not much hope.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, Prabhupada uses that example to help us understand the importance of strictly following the regulative principles, not only the four regulative principles but the regulative principles of devotional service. Krishna says to Arjuna:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tatha cittam samadhatum<br />\r\n\tna saknoshi mayi sthiram<br />\r\n\tabhyasa-yogena tato<br />\r\n\tmam icchaptum dhananjaya<br />\r\n\t(BG 12.9)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"If you cannot always fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way you will develop the desire to attain Me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrishna is not speaking to Arjuna about following the four regulative principles, He is talking to Arjuna about following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, which means \"nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya,\" mentioned in the previous verse, which is \"by regularly hearing Srimad Bhagavatam and serving the devotees, all that is inauspicious to the heart becomes destroyed.\" The four regulative principles are the regulative principles of human life, not the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. The four regulative principles are what distinguishes a human being from an animal. Krishna is telling Arjuna to follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, which means that one has to regulate one’s hearing and chanting of the glories of the Supreme Lord. By regularly hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord in the association of devotees, the inauspicious things from within the heart become practically, but not completely, destroyed. The word \"practically\" is used because there is still some trace of influence of these modes of material nature. But one is not influenced by them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that the modes of material nature are not completely gone until one achieves the stage of bhava. Nonetheless, as Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains, the transition that one goes through by regularly hearing the message of Srimad Bhagavatam means that one passes through the stage of anisthita-bhakti to nisthita-bhakti. Anisthita-bhakti means unsteady devotional service, and nisthita-bhakti means steady devotional service. Then Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur explains the verses that we were reading in the last few days,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah<br />\r\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah<br />\r\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani<br />\r\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam<br />\r\n\t(SB 1.2.17)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cleanses the desire for material enjoyment within the heart of that person who develops the urge to hear His messages. This verse is actually for those who are still situated on the platform of anisthita-bhakti. Yesterday’s verse bhaktir bhavati naisthiki (SB 1.2.18), is the verse which describes nisthita-bhakti for those who are on the platform of nistha, and in the middle, between these two stages, is abhadrani vidhunoti, which means that inauspicious things become destroyed within the heart, which is anartha-nivritti. So there is anisthita-bhakti, unsteady devotional service; anartha-nivritti; and nisthita-bhakti; or bhajana-kriya, anartha-nivritti and nistha. Nonetheless the cleansing of the heart means removing the obstacles on the path of devotional service, and those obstacles exist due to one still being influenced by the modes of nature. And therefore Prabhupada, today in the commentary, says that self-satisfaction in the stage of devotional service, this self satisfaction is not like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorance, whereas the self-satisfied atmanandi is transcendental to the material state of existence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is interesting how Prabhupada describes a person who is influenced by the mode of ignorance in the Bhagavad-gita. With respect to the inactive fool and the satisfaction he experiences, Prabhupada explains that when there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, then darkness, inertia, madness and illusion are manifested. This is Krishna’s illusion. To quote Srila Prabhupada, 'One in the mode of ignorance does not work by a regulative principle; he wants to act whimsically, for no purpose. Even though he has the capacity to work, he makes no endeavor. This is called illusion. Although consciousness is going on, life is inactive. These are the symptoms of one in the mode of ignorance.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMany times Srila Prabhupada told the story about Indra when he was cursed by Brihaspati. Indra had to come down to this world and take birth as a hog. He had a hog family; he had his hog wife, he had his hog children. And then Lord Brahma was calling Indra to come back. when Indra was being called, he was thinking, \"Well, I have my wife, I have my children. Everything is going well. Why do I have to go back?\" Prabhupada uses this example, that the hog is satisfied living in stool. He thinks, \"This is nice, I am satisfied,\" but somebody from a higher level of consciousness looks and says, \"Oh, how can you be satisfied in that status?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Prabhupada is saying here that one who is steeped in the mode of ignorance is like the inactive fool. The inactive fool thinks, \"Yes, I am satisfied, things are OK. I am satisfied with my ignorance. I am satisfied being inactive, there is nothing I am doing. I am just satisfied living like this. I am not influenced by the mode of ignorance.\" But the mode of ignorance is manifested by darkness, inertia, madness and illusion. What is the symptom of passion? The symptom of passion is intense hankering in fruitive activity, always hankering for some result. When one comes to the stage of steady devotional service, this influence of the modes of ignorance and passion, is virtually nonexistent. That is the symptom of steadiness in devotional service, that there are no symptoms of the influence of the modes of nature.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that for one who comes to this level of nisthita-bhakti, actually situated on the platform of nistha, there are no symptoms of laya, or sleepiness while engaged in bhajan or kirtan. He describes the five symptoms of those still influenced.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first symptom is laya, the tendency to sleep when one is engaged in kirtan, showing that there is still some influence of the mode of ignorance. Then there is viksepa, distraction. Viksepa means when one is distracted by tendencies towards material things while engaged in kirtan, like a devotee who is sitting and chanting japa, and then all of the sudden he is distracted by a tendency to speak prajalpa to the person next to him. He tried to be very visibly attentive, \"Hareee...\" and then… prajalpa. The third symptom of being influenced by the modes of material nature is apratipatti which means that although there is no visible influence by laya, or viksepa, still one cannot completely fix his mind in bhajan. Kasaya, that is the next symptom, means one is still influenced by pride, greed and anger. Obviously these are symptoms that one is still influenced by the modes of nature. And rasasvada, which is the fifth symptom means&nbsp; that although one has all facility to be absorbed in kirtan, whenever there is a proposal for some sense gratification, one gets distracted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo nisthita-bhakti or nistha means that there is no influence; all these symptoms are gone. So of course, that is an advanced stage. Anisthita-bhakti is probably something which is more relevant for our discussion. The verse states \"srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah,\" that Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is within the core of the heart. He cleanses the desire for material enjoyment within the heart of a person who develops an urge to hear.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo this anisthita-bhakti is symptomized by six characteristics which are all explained by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura. The first is utsaha-mayi, false enthusiasm. A person with this symptom thinks that because he has developed an ability to do something in bhakti, he is therefore qualified. He is enthusiastic, because people recognize his expertise. \"I can play karatalas, really expertly!\" Somebody sees, \"Oh, you play very good karatalas.\" \"Yes, I am a very advanced devotee.\" And as soon as somebody does not recognize his expert karatala playing, immediately he loses his enthusiasm. So this is called utsaha-mayi, false enthusiasm. It is not real. That is the first symptom.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe second is ghana-tarala. Ghana-tarala means that sometimes we are very, very attentive in our studies, completely into it. But then sometimes we are just not into it at all. We get absorbed in our mind and therefore cannot get into our studies at all. Ghana-tarala means thick and diluted. Then there is vyudha vikalpa. Vyudha vikalpa means indecisiveness. \"Should I become renounced, forget about my duties in householder life; renounce everything? Yet when I read in the Bhagavatam there are so many householders, very elevated, saintly persons, some of them were even Mahajanas, I think I could become a householder. Look at the list of Mahajanas (SB 6.3.20-21). Many are householders. Of course I should follow in their footsteps, but household life is very troublesome. I can read about that in Bhagavatam too. What should I do?\" Vyudha vikalpa; we live in a state of indecisiveness, going back and forth, \"Should I renounce or not be renounced?\" I think my mind is busy, engaged in devotional service. But I'm simply busy going back and forth, accepting and rejecting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is no nistha, there is no resolute determination. Simply riding on the chariot of the mind, manorathena. Lord Caitanya says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t‘dvaite’ bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba — ‘manodharma’<br />\r\n\t‘ei bhala, ei manda’, — ei saba ‘bhrama’<br />\r\n\t(CC Antya 4.176)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"To say this is good and bad, this is all a mistake.\" He said this to Sanatana Gosvami. Sanatana Gosvami pleaded, \"Please do not touch my body. It is bad.\" Sanatana Gosvami’s body was full of sores and Lord Caitanya wanted to embrace him. And Lord Caitanya responded, \"No, actually to think ‘this is good and this is bad’, this is all a mistake. It is an illusion.\" And He used the word, ‘dvaite’ bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba — ‘manodharma’. Manodharma means the religion of mind: \"this is good, this is bad.\" Or as the verse says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tyasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana<br />\r\n\tsarvair gunais tatra samasate surah<br />\r\n\tharav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna<br />\r\n\tmanorathenasati dhavato bahih<br />\r\n\t(SB 5.18.12)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada would quote this verse many times, how all the qualities of the demigods become manifested in a devotee. On the other hand, a nondevotee cannot have any good qualities because he is driven on the chariot of the mind. So one has to be careful not to be influenced by this manorathena, to be riding on the chariot of the mind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo vyudha vikalpa means manorathena, indecisiveness. Then there is visaya-sangara. Visaya-sangara is another symptom of anisthita-bhakti, which means that sometimes we get very determined, \"I see what my maya is, I am going to renounce it. Better I make a vow and give it up.\" Then the next day we indulge in the very same thing we had renounced. Then we think, \"Oh, why did I do that?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact there is a verse in the 11th Canto of the Bhagavatam, which illustrates this tendency. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also quotes this verse in reference to visaya-sangara. It is a very important verse because it is very much related to these verses that we are reading from Srimad Bhagavatam. The verse says, \"Having awakened faith in hearing the narrations of My glories, being disgusted with sense gratification, and knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering, but one still cannot give it up.\" He said, \"Therefore…\" Krishna says, \"But My devotee should remain happy and continue worshipping with faith and conviction, because My devotee knows that even though sense gratification leads to suffering, he sincerely repents when he engages in it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo this sincere repentance in the heart is very important. This verse illustrates the point about visaya-sangara; that we renounce something and then very soon we indulge in the very same thing we renounced. However for a devotee who has awakened his faith in hearing about Krishna, because he has awakened faith, \"srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah\", he has the urge to hear more and more about Krishna. He goes on hearing because he knows that by continuing to do so, he can remain happy. By hearing, all these unwanted things will become destroyed. This is how he gets free from the symptoms of anisthita-bhakti: \"nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya\", by regularly hearing Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a regulative principle of devotional service, we are regularly hearing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsatam prasaṅgan mama virya-samvido<br />\r\n\tbhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah<br />\r\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani<br />\r\n\tsraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati<br />\r\n\t(SB 3.25.25)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the association of devotees, discussions of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead become very pleasing to the ear and to the heart. They go into the ear and enter into the heart. And when they enter into the heart, what happens? The devotee advances. Gradually, his faith becomes strong. He develops some attachment to Krishna. Then bhakti, real devotional service, begins. Sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati means from sraddha all the way to prema, even those who are on the platform of prema, \"prayena munayo rajan nivrtta vidhi-sedhatah\" (SB 2.1.7), they derive their greatest satisfaction by hearing and chanting about Krishna. It begins with regulation, beginning with faith. Then progressively, regulation subsides because it becomes spontaneous, all the way to prema.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the 10th Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam when Pariksit Maharaja and Sukadeva Gosvami are having some dialogue, Sukadeva Gosvami says, \"Paramahamsas who have accepted Krishna within the core of their heart, they are attracted to the topics of Krishna as if they are ever fresh. And therefore they are spontaneously attracted to Krishna in the same way that a materialistic person is spontaneously attracted to speaking about women and sex.\" A materialistic person does not have to practice talking about women and sex. Why? It is spontaneous. Why? It is always in the heart. Therefore, because it is always in the heart, spontaneously he speaks about these things. The slightest attractive object he sees, immediately and spontaneously it awakens a desire to speak about these topics. Similarly, paramahamsas who have accepted Krishna within the core of their hearts, they are spontaneously attracted to speaking about Krishna. They have accepted Krishna within the core of their heart, therefore to speak about Him is spontaneous, because they see Krishna in everything, they see Krishna everywhere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo in the most advanced stages, certainly, one spontaneously speaks about Krishna. But for those on the platform of anisthita-bhakti, it is not so spontaneous. And because it is not spontaneous, one has to regularly hear— regularly! These are regulative principle of bhakti yoga; one has to regularly hear.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsmartavyah satatam visnur<br />\r\n\tvismartavyo na jatucit<br />\r\n\tsarve vidhi-nisedhah syur<br />\r\n\tetayor eva kinkarah<br />\r\n\t(CC Madhya 22.113)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Krishna must always be remembered and He must never be forgotten. All the rules and regulations given in the scriptures are meant to be the servant of these two principles.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tServants of these two principles; vidhis and nisedhas. Vidhis means positive activities, nisedhas are prohibited activities. Positive activities: always think of Krishna. Negative activities we should avoid: do not forget Krishna. This is what we avoid, forgetfulness of Krishna. The positive is to always remember. So all these vidhis and nisedhas are meant to serve these two principles. But in the commentary of this verse, there is a very nice explanation. Smartavyah satatam, generally satatam means \"always;\" however in this verse, it implies something different. Because for one who is always remembering Krishna, why does he have to worry about forgetting Him? For one who is always speaking about Krishna, why does he have to worry about saying something that is not related to Krishna? Why should he think about wanting to say anything that is not Krishna conscious? He is always speaking about Krishna. Why does he have to think about prohibited activities? He is always speaking about Krishna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore in this verse means, the word \"satatam\" instead of meaning \"always\" means \"every day.\" Every day we must regularly hear. This is our regulative principle of bhakti yoga. This festival is meant to remind us of what we are supposed to be doing every day when we leave. It is not just, \"Oh, I am going to hear at the festival,\" and then we go back and think, \"Until the next festival.\" No, it is not from festival to festival. It is every day. Why? Because it cleanses the heart; that makes us qualified to relish Srimad Bhagavatam. It makes us qualified to get some taste, because we are regulating our lives around devotional service. And gradually, then, the influence of these unwanted things will be destroyed. This is the power. This is what is being explained in today’s verse; the influence of the modes of passion and ignorance will be gone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, we did not mention the other symptoms of anisthita bhakti. Quickly we will just mention them; after visaya-sangara is niyamaksama. For example, we make a vow to chant extra rounds but we cannot keep them. \"Every Ekadasi, I am going to completely fast.\" Somebody walks by with a plate of prasadam, \"…starting next Ekadasi.\" So that is niyamaksama. And taranga-rangini means enjoying the waves of bhakti. Sometimes bhakti is attractive, the person has a little bhakti, he becomes attractive to others and sometimes we get some benefits by being engaged in bhakti. We may get some facility, we may get our own room in the asrama, we may get some respect. Immediately we think, \"Oh, yes! I am going to enjoy.\" So taranga-rangini means enjoying the waves that come from being engaged in bhakti.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo these are all symptoms of anisthita-bhakti, and as we said these symptoms are probably more relevant to discuss, symptoms of how the modes of material nature will influence us. However these important verses from Srimad Bhagavatam that we have been reading from the last several days give every devotee hope of how we can come to a higher platform. And for us, these things that we spoke about, of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam regularly in the association of devotees, that for us is staying in the boat. We will still be influenced until we actually come to that platform of nisthita-bhakti, but we should simply stay in the boat. Staying in the boat means chanting our rounds, following the four regulative principles, and engaging in the regulative principle of devotional service. Krishna says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tatha cittam samadhatum<br />\r\n\tna saknosi mayi sthiram<br />\r\n\t(BG 12.9)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"If you follow these regulative principles of devotional service, the desire to attain Me will be awakened in your heart.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krishna. All glories to Prabhupada.\r\n</p>\r\n",

Then the devotee is established in goodness, and he becomes completely happy.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA living being in his normal constitutional position is fully satisfied in spiritual bliss. This state of existence is called brahma-bhūta or atmananda, or the state of self-satisfaction. This self-satisfaction is not like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorance, whereas the self-satisfied atmanandi is transcendental to the material state of existence. This stage of perfection is attained as soon as one is fixed in irrevocable devotional service. Devotional service is not inactivity, but the unalloyed activity of the soul.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe soul’s activity becomes adulterated in contact with matter, and as such the diseased activities are expressed in the form of lust, desire, hankering, inactivity, foolishness and sleep. The effect of devotional service becomes manifest by complete elimination of these effects of passion and ignorance. The devotee is fixed at once in the mode of goodness, and he makes further progress to rise to the position of vasudeva, or the state of unmixed sattva, or suddha-sattva. Only in this suddha-sattva state can one always see Krishna face to face by dint of pure affection for the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA devotee is always in the mode of unalloyed goodness; therefore he harms no one. But the nondevotee, however educated he may be, is always harmful. A devotee is neither foolish nor passionate. The harmful, foolish and passionate cannot be devotees of the Lord, however they may advertise themselves as devotees by outward dress. A devotee is always qualified with all the good qualities of God. Quantitatively such qualifications may be different, but qualitatively both the Lord and His devotee are one and the same.<br />\n\t(SB 1.2.19)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we are reading some very important verses from Srimad Bhagavatam. These verses describe the cleansing of the heart by devotional service, and how obstacles are removed from the heart for those who engage in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord in the association of devotees. In this verse today, the Srimad Bhagavatam is explaining how one comes to the platform of nistha, or steadiness in devotional service, and some of the symptoms of one who is situated on this platform.  One who is on this platform is not affected by the modes of material nature. It is important to understand that there may be some trace of the modes of material nature even for one who is situated on this platform, but the point is that one is not influenced by them, and this is established here by the words ceta etair anaviddham, which means that one is not affected in the mind by these.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada, I remember, used an example of how a devotee is one who stays in the boat of devotional service. If one is crossing the ocean and there is a lot of disturbance in the middle of the ocean, with so many waves, as long as one stays in the boat, though he will be influenced by the waves, at least he is not in the waves themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is one thing to be drowning in the waves in the middle of the ocean, but it is another thing to be in the boat. In other words, although one may be influenced by those waves in the boat, rocking back and forth, still one is in the boat. Srila Prabhupada said that to stay in the boat means that one should strictly follow the regulative principles of Krishna consciousness. This is what keeps us in the boat as opposed to jumping ship. If one jumps ship, there is not much hope.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, Prabhupada uses that example to help us understand the importance of strictly following the regulative principles, not only the four regulative principles but the regulative principles of devotional service. Krishna says to Arjuna:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tatha cittam samadhatum<br />\n\tna saknoshi mayi sthiram<br />\n\tabhyasa-yogena tato<br />\n\tmam icchaptum dhananjaya<br />\n\t(BG 12.9)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"If you cannot always fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way you will develop the desire to attain Me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrishna is not speaking to Arjuna about following the four regulative principles, He is talking to Arjuna about following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, which means \"nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya,\" mentioned in the previous verse, which is \"by regularly hearing Srimad Bhagavatam and serving the devotees, all that is inauspicious to the heart becomes destroyed.\" The four regulative principles are the regulative principles of human life, not the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. The four regulative principles are what distinguishes a human being from an animal. Krishna is telling Arjuna to follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, which means that one has to regulate one’s hearing and chanting of the glories of the Supreme Lord. By regularly hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord in the association of devotees, the inauspicious things from within the heart become practically, but not completely, destroyed. The word \"practically\" is used because there is still some trace of influence of these modes of material nature. But one is not influenced by them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that the modes of material nature are not completely gone until one achieves the stage of bhava. Nonetheless, as Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains, the transition that one goes through by regularly hearing the message of Srimad Bhagavatam means that one passes through the stage of anisthita-bhakti to nisthita-bhakti. Anisthita-bhakti means unsteady devotional service, and nisthita-bhakti means steady devotional service. Then Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur explains the verses that we were reading in the last few days,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah<br />\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah<br />\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani<br />\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam<br />\n\t(SB 1.2.17)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cleanses the desire for material enjoyment within the heart of that person who develops the urge to hear His messages. This verse is actually for those who are still situated on the platform of anisthita-bhakti. Yesterday’s verse bhaktir bhavati naisthiki (SB 1.2.18), is the verse which describes nisthita-bhakti for those who are on the platform of nistha, and in the middle, between these two stages, is abhadrani vidhunoti, which means that inauspicious things become destroyed within the heart, which is anartha-nivritti. So there is anisthita-bhakti, unsteady devotional service; anartha-nivritti; and nisthita-bhakti; or bhajana-kriya, anartha-nivritti and nistha. Nonetheless the cleansing of the heart means removing the obstacles on the path of devotional service, and those obstacles exist due to one still being influenced by the modes of nature. And therefore Prabhupada, today in the commentary, says that self-satisfaction in the stage of devotional service, this self satisfaction is not like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorance, whereas the self-satisfied atmanandi is transcendental to the material state of existence.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is interesting how Prabhupada describes a person who is influenced by the mode of ignorance in the Bhagavad-gita. With respect to the inactive fool and the satisfaction he experiences, Prabhupada explains that when there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, then darkness, inertia, madness and illusion are manifested. This is Krishna’s illusion. To quote Srila Prabhupada, 'One in the mode of ignorance does not work by a regulative principle; he wants to act whimsically, for no purpose. Even though he has the capacity to work, he makes no endeavor. This is called illusion. Although consciousness is going on, life is inactive. These are the symptoms of one in the mode of ignorance.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMany times Srila Prabhupada told the story about Indra when he was cursed by Brihaspati. Indra had to come down to this world and take birth as a hog. He had a hog family; he had his hog wife, he had his hog children. And then Lord Brahma was calling Indra to come back. when Indra was being called, he was thinking, \"Well, I have my wife, I have my children. Everything is going well. Why do I have to go back?\" Prabhupada uses this example, that the hog is satisfied living in stool. He thinks, \"This is nice, I am satisfied,\" but somebody from a higher level of consciousness looks and says, \"Oh, how can you be satisfied in that status?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Prabhupada is saying here that one who is steeped in the mode of ignorance is like the inactive fool. The inactive fool thinks, \"Yes, I am satisfied, things are OK. I am satisfied with my ignorance. I am satisfied being inactive, there is nothing I am doing. I am just satisfied living like this. I am not influenced by the mode of ignorance.\" But the mode of ignorance is manifested by darkness, inertia, madness and illusion. What is the symptom of passion? The symptom of passion is intense hankering in fruitive activity, always hankering for some result. When one comes to the stage of steady devotional service, this influence of the modes of ignorance and passion, is virtually nonexistent. That is the symptom of steadiness in devotional service, that there are no symptoms of the influence of the modes of nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that for one who comes to this level of nisthita-bhakti, actually situated on the platform of nistha, there are no symptoms of laya, or sleepiness while engaged in bhajan or kirtan. He describes the five symptoms of those still influenced.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first symptom is laya, the tendency to sleep when one is engaged in kirtan, showing that there is still some influence of the mode of ignorance. Then there is viksepa, distraction. Viksepa means when one is distracted by tendencies towards material things while engaged in kirtan, like a devotee who is sitting and chanting japa, and then all of the sudden he is distracted by a tendency to speak prajalpa to the person next to him. He tried to be very visibly attentive, \"Hareee...\" and then… prajalpa. The third symptom of being influenced by the modes of material nature is apratipatti which means that although there is no visible influence by laya, or viksepa, still one cannot completely fix his mind in bhajan. Kasaya, that is the next symptom, means one is still influenced by pride, greed and anger. Obviously these are symptoms that one is still influenced by the modes of nature. And rasasvada, which is the fifth symptom means  that although one has all facility to be absorbed in kirtan, whenever there is a proposal for some sense gratification, one gets distracted.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo nisthita-bhakti or nistha means that there is no influence; all these symptoms are gone. So of course, that is an advanced stage. Anisthita-bhakti is probably something which is more relevant for our discussion. The verse states \"srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah,\" that Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is within the core of the heart. He cleanses the desire for material enjoyment within the heart of a person who develops an urge to hear.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this anisthita-bhakti is symptomized by six characteristics which are all explained by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura. The first is utsaha-mayi, false enthusiasm. A person with this symptom thinks that because he has developed an ability to do something in bhakti, he is therefore qualified. He is enthusiastic, because people recognize his expertise. \"I can play karatalas, really expertly!\" Somebody sees, \"Oh, you play very good karatalas.\" \"Yes, I am a very advanced devotee.\" And as soon as somebody does not recognize his expert karatala playing, immediately he loses his enthusiasm. So this is called utsaha-mayi, false enthusiasm. It is not real. That is the first symptom.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second is ghana-tarala. Ghana-tarala means that sometimes we are very, very attentive in our studies, completely into it. But then sometimes we are just not into it at all. We get absorbed in our mind and therefore cannot get into our studies at all. Ghana-tarala means thick and diluted. Then there is vyudha vikalpa. Vyudha vikalpa means indecisiveness. \"Should I become renounced, forget about my duties in householder life; renounce everything? Yet when I read in the Bhagavatam there are so many householders, very elevated, saintly persons, some of them were even Mahajanas, I think I could become a householder. Look at the list of Mahajanas (SB 6.3.20-21). Many are householders. Of course I should follow in their footsteps, but household life is very troublesome. I can read about that in Bhagavatam too. What should I do?\" Vyudha vikalpa; we live in a state of indecisiveness, going back and forth, \"Should I renounce or not be renounced?\" I think my mind is busy, engaged in devotional service. But I'm simply busy going back and forth, accepting and rejecting.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no nistha, there is no resolute determination. Simply riding on the chariot of the mind, manorathena. Lord Caitanya says:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t‘dvaite’ bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba — ‘manodharma’<br />\n\t‘ei bhala, ei manda’, — ei saba ‘bhrama’<br />\n\t(CC Antya 4.176)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"To say this is good and bad, this is all a mistake.\" He said this to Sanatana Gosvami. Sanatana Gosvami pleaded, \"Please do not touch my body. It is bad.\" Sanatana Gosvami’s body was full of sores and Lord Caitanya wanted to embrace him. And Lord Caitanya responded, \"No, actually to think ‘this is good and this is bad’, this is all a mistake. It is an illusion.\" And He used the word, ‘dvaite’ bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba — ‘manodharma’. Manodharma means the religion of mind: \"this is good, this is bad.\" Or as the verse says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tyasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana<br />\n\tsarvair gunais tatra samasate surah<br />\n\tharav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna<br />\n\tmanorathenasati dhavato bahih<br />\n\t(SB 5.18.12)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada would quote this verse many times, how all the qualities of the demigods become manifested in a devotee. On the other hand, a nondevotee cannot have any good qualities because he is driven on the chariot of the mind. So one has to be careful not to be influenced by this manorathena, to be riding on the chariot of the mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo vyudha vikalpa means manorathena, indecisiveness. Then there is visaya-sangara. Visaya-sangara is another symptom of anisthita-bhakti, which means that sometimes we get very determined, \"I see what my maya is, I am going to renounce it. Better I make a vow and give it up.\" Then the next day we indulge in the very same thing we had renounced. Then we think, \"Oh, why did I do that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact there is a verse in the 11th Canto of the Bhagavatam, which illustrates this tendency. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also quotes this verse in reference to visaya-sangara. It is a very important verse because it is very much related to these verses that we are reading from Srimad Bhagavatam. The verse says, \"Having awakened faith in hearing the narrations of My glories, being disgusted with sense gratification, and knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering, but one still cannot give it up.\" He said, \"Therefore…\" Krishna says, \"But My devotee should remain happy and continue worshipping with faith and conviction, because My devotee knows that even though sense gratification leads to suffering, he sincerely repents when he engages in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this sincere repentance in the heart is very important. This verse illustrates the point about visaya-sangara; that we renounce something and then very soon we indulge in the very same thing we renounced. However for a devotee who has awakened his faith in hearing about Krishna, because he has awakened faith, \"srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah\", he has the urge to hear more and more about Krishna. He goes on hearing because he knows that by continuing to do so, he can remain happy. By hearing, all these unwanted things will become destroyed. This is how he gets free from the symptoms of anisthita-bhakti: \"nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya\", by regularly hearing Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a regulative principle of devotional service, we are regularly hearing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsatam prasaṅgan mama virya-samvido<br />\n\tbhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah<br />\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani<br />\n\tsraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati<br />\n\t(SB 3.25.25)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the association of devotees, discussions of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead become very pleasing to the ear and to the heart. They go into the ear and enter into the heart. And when they enter into the heart, what happens? The devotee advances. Gradually, his faith becomes strong. He develops some attachment to Krishna. Then bhakti, real devotional service, begins. Sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati means from sraddha all the way to prema, even those who are on the platform of prema, \"prayena munayo rajan nivrtta vidhi-sedhatah\" (SB 2.1.7), they derive their greatest satisfaction by hearing and chanting about Krishna. It begins with regulation, beginning with faith. Then progressively, regulation subsides because it becomes spontaneous, all the way to prema.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the 10th Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam when Pariksit Maharaja and Sukadeva Gosvami are having some dialogue, Sukadeva Gosvami says, \"Paramahamsas who have accepted Krishna within the core of their heart, they are attracted to the topics of Krishna as if they are ever fresh. And therefore they are spontaneously attracted to Krishna in the same way that a materialistic person is spontaneously attracted to speaking about women and sex.\" A materialistic person does not have to practice talking about women and sex. Why? It is spontaneous. Why? It is always in the heart. Therefore, because it is always in the heart, spontaneously he speaks about these things. The slightest attractive object he sees, immediately and spontaneously it awakens a desire to speak about these topics. Similarly, paramahamsas who have accepted Krishna within the core of their hearts, they are spontaneously attracted to speaking about Krishna. They have accepted Krishna within the core of their heart, therefore to speak about Him is spontaneous, because they see Krishna in everything, they see Krishna everywhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in the most advanced stages, certainly, one spontaneously speaks about Krishna. But for those on the platform of anisthita-bhakti, it is not so spontaneous. And because it is not spontaneous, one has to regularly hear— regularly! These are regulative principle of bhakti yoga; one has to regularly hear.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsmartavyah satatam visnur<br />\n\tvismartavyo na jatucit<br />\n\tsarve vidhi-nisedhah syur<br />\n\tetayor eva kinkarah<br />\n\t(CC Madhya 22.113)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Krishna must always be remembered and He must never be forgotten. All the rules and regulations given in the scriptures are meant to be the servant of these two principles.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tServants of these two principles; vidhis and nisedhas. Vidhis means positive activities, nisedhas are prohibited activities. Positive activities: always think of Krishna. Negative activities we should avoid: do not forget Krishna. This is what we avoid, forgetfulness of Krishna. The positive is to always remember. So all these vidhis and nisedhas are meant to serve these two principles. But in the commentary of this verse, there is a very nice explanation. Smartavyah satatam, generally satatam means \"always;\" however in this verse, it implies something different. Because for one who is always remembering Krishna, why does he have to worry about forgetting Him? For one who is always speaking about Krishna, why does he have to worry about saying something that is not related to Krishna? Why should he think about wanting to say anything that is not Krishna conscious? He is always speaking about Krishna. Why does he have to think about prohibited activities? He is always speaking about Krishna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore in this verse means, the word \"satatam\" instead of meaning \"always\" means \"every day.\" Every day we must regularly hear. This is our regulative principle of bhakti yoga. This festival is meant to remind us of what we are supposed to be doing every day when we leave. It is not just, \"Oh, I am going to hear at the festival,\" and then we go back and think, \"Until the next festival.\" No, it is not from festival to festival. It is every day. Why? Because it cleanses the heart; that makes us qualified to relish Srimad Bhagavatam. It makes us qualified to get some taste, because we are regulating our lives around devotional service. And gradually, then, the influence of these unwanted things will be destroyed. This is the power. This is what is being explained in today’s verse; the influence of the modes of passion and ignorance will be gone.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, we did not mention the other symptoms of anisthita bhakti. Quickly we will just mention them; after visaya-sangara is niyamaksama. For example, we make a vow to chant extra rounds but we cannot keep them. \"Every Ekadasi, I am going to completely fast.\" Somebody walks by with a plate of prasadam, \"…starting next Ekadasi.\" So that is niyamaksama. And taranga-rangini means enjoying the waves of bhakti. Sometimes bhakti is attractive, the person has a little bhakti, he becomes attractive to others and sometimes we get some benefits by being engaged in bhakti. We may get some facility, we may get our own room in the asrama, we may get some respect. Immediately we think, \"Oh, yes! I am going to enjoy.\" So taranga-rangini means enjoying the waves that come from being engaged in bhakti.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo these are all symptoms of anisthita-bhakti, and as we said these symptoms are probably more relevant to discuss, symptoms of how the modes of material nature will influence us. However these important verses from Srimad Bhagavatam that we have been reading from the last several days give every devotee hope of how we can come to a higher platform. And for us, these things that we spoke about, of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam regularly in the association of devotees, that for us is staying in the boat. We will still be influenced until we actually come to that platform of nisthita-bhakti, but we should simply stay in the boat. Staying in the boat means chanting our rounds, following the four regulative principles, and engaging in the regulative principle of devotional service. Krishna says:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tatha cittam samadhatum<br />\n\tna saknosi mayi sthiram<br />\n\t(BG 12.9)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"If you follow these regulative principles of devotional service, the desire to attain Me will be awakened in your heart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krishna. All glories to Prabhupada.\n</p>\n",

Bhakti Caitanya Swami and I will be studying together. We planned this one-month studying retreat together almost a year ago. We will both arrive in Kiev on June 22nd. We have already commissioned a teacher for this period. He will be with us for three hours a day, six days a week. We will also be studying at other times as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI have not as yet discussed with Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja what he is planning to do during his stay in Kiev.

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tDuring the past couple of weeks, on more than one occasion, I've mentioned the morning conversations I've been listening to between Srila Prabhupada and senior disciples about the controversial court case against our movement in 1977. There were serious allegations of brainwashing against our movement at that time and there was an organized attempt in the United States, by prominent religionists and so-called anti-cultists, to expose the Krsna consciousness movement as a dangerous \"cult.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring these conversations, Srila Prabhupada, in his usual style, was also very outspoken and gave argument after argument how we should present ourselves in the court.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo days ago, I was listening to the following conversation which took place in Mayapura, just after the final decision of that case in the New York States Supreme Court. I thought it might be interesting for my readers to hear the court's decision and Srila Prabhupada's reaction to that decision, as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: […] I told you this must have been published.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTamala Krsna: Should I read it, Srila Prabhupada?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: Yes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTamala Krsna: \"Washington...\"<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: You can get this light on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTamala Krsna: \"Washington, March 18th. The Hare Krsna movement was called a 'bona fide religion' yesterday by the New York high-court justice who threw out two charges against the officials of the movement of 'illegal imprisonment' and 'attempted extortion.' A charge had been preferred by an angry parent that his son, as well as another disciple, had been held by the movement illegally and that they had been brainwashed. 'The entire and basic issue before the court,' said the Justice in dismissing the charges, 'is whether or not the two alleged victims in this case and the defendants will be allowed to practice the religion of their choice, and this must be answered with a resounding affirmative.' Said Mr. Justice John J. Lee, 'The Hare Krsna movement is a bona fide religion with roots in India that go back thousands of years. It behooved Merrilee Kreshower and Edward Shapiro to follow the tenets of that faith, and their inalienable right to do so will not be trampled upon.' \" This is all quote. \" 'The separation of Church and State must be maintained. We are and must remain a nation of laws, not of men. The presentment and indictment by the Grand Jury was in direct and blatant violation of the defendants' Constitutional rights.' The Justice said that it appeared to the court that 'The people rest their case on an erroneous minor premise to arrive at a fallacious conclusion. The record is devoid of one specific allegation of a misrepresentation or any act of deception on the part of any defendant.' The Justice said, 'The freedom of religion is not to be abridged because it is unconventional in its beliefs and practices or because it is approved or disapproved by the mainstream of society or more conventional religions. Without this proliferation and freedom to follow the dictates of one's own conscience in this search for the approach to God, the freedom of religion will be a meaningless right as provided for in the Constitution. Any attempt, be it circuitous, direct, well-intentioned or not, presents a clear and present danger to this most fundamental basis and eternally needed right of our citizens -- freedom of religion.' \"<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: Hmm. That is...<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTamala Krsna: \"The Hare Krsna movement has been under pressure from various groups, and this judgment is expected to stop some of the harassment to which it has been subjected in recent months.\"<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSvarupa Damodara: Very good.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: So you purchase some copies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTamala Krsna: Hmm. This is yesterday's Times of India from Bombay. When we get to Bombay we'll go to their office. We can buy back issues, I think. I don't know... I'll find out who... Abhirama gave me this. \"Published from Bombay, Delhi and Ahmedabad.\"<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: Now we have got a sound position.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSvarupa Damodara: Yes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTamala Krsna: Maybe it's in some other... I have the Sunday Statesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: In the first page they have given, eh?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTamala Krsna: Yes. First page of Times of India.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: And big heading?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTamala Krsna: Yes. \"Hare Krsna Movement is Bona Fide Religion.\" [laughs] You couldn't pay for an advertisement this good.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: So my mission is now successful.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSvarupa Damodara: Yes, Srila Prabhupada.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: In 1965 I went there, and this is now recognized after ten years ago.

I thought it might be interesting for my readers to hear the court's decision and Srila Prabhupada's reaction to that decision, as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: […] I told you this must have been published.</p>\n<p>\tTamala Krsna: Should I read it, Srila Prabhupada?</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: Yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTamala Krsna: \"Washington...\"</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: You can get this light on.</p>\n<p>\tTamala Krsna: \"Washington, March 18th. The Hare Krsna movement was called a 'bona fide religion' yesterday by the New York high-court justice who threw out two charges against the officials of the movement of 'illegal imprisonment' and 'attempted extortion.' A charge had been preferred by an angry parent that his son, as well as another disciple, had been held by the movement illegally and that they had been brainwashed. 'The entire and basic issue before the court,' said the Justice in dismissing the charges, 'is whether or not the two alleged victims in this case and the defendants will be allowed to practice the religion of their choice, and this must be answered with a resounding affirmative.' Said Mr. Justice John J. Lee, 'The Hare Krsna movement is a bona fide religion with roots in India that go back thousands of years. It behooved Merrilee Kreshower and Edward Shapiro to follow the tenets of that faith, and their inalienable right to do so will not be trampled upon.' \" This is all quote. \" 'The separation of Church and State must be maintained. We are and must remain a nation of laws, not of men. The presentment and indictment by the Grand Jury was in direct and blatant violation of the defendants' Constitutional rights.' The Justice said that it appeared to the court that 'The people rest their case on an erroneous minor premise to arrive at a fallacious conclusion. The record is devoid of one specific allegation of a misrepresentation or any act of deception on the part of any defendant.' The Justice said, 'The freedom of religion is not to be abridged because it is unconventional in its beliefs and practices or because it is approved or disapproved by the mainstream of society or more conventional religions. Without this proliferation and freedom to follow the dictates of one's own conscience in this search for the approach to God, the freedom of religion will be a meaningless right as provided for in the Constitution. Any attempt, be it circuitous, direct, well-intentioned or not, presents a clear and present danger to this most fundamental basis and eternally needed right of our citizens -- freedom of religion.' \"</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: Hmm. That is...</p>\n<p>\tTamala Krsna: \"The Hare Krsna movement has been under pressure from various groups, and this judgment is expected to stop some of the harassment to which it has been subjected in recent months.\"</p>\n<p>\tSvarupa Damodara: Very good.</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: So you purchase some copies.</p>\n<p>\tTamala Krsna: Hmm. This is yesterday's Times of India from Bombay. When we get to Bombay we'll go to their office. We can buy back issues, I think. I don't know... I'll find out who... Abhirama gave me this. \"Published from Bombay, Delhi and Ahmedabad.\"</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: Now we have got a sound position.</p>\n<p>\tSvarupa Damodara: Yes.</p>\n<p>\tTamala Krsna: Maybe it's in some other... I have the Sunday Statesman.</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: In the first page they have given, eh?</p>\n<p>\tTamala Krsna: Yes. First page of Times of India.</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: And big heading?</p>\n<p>\tTamala Krsna: Yes. \"Hare Krsna Movement is Bona Fide Religion.\" [laughs] You couldn't pay for an advertisement this good.</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: So my mission is now successful.</p>\n<p>\tSvarupa Damodara: Yes, Srila Prabhupada.</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: In 1965 I went there, and this is now recognized after ten years ago. Ten years? Twelve years, eh?</p>\n<p>\tTamala Krsna: Twelve years.</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada: Loitering in the street. Nobody cared for me. Alone carrying the books. Now organize Bombay as our headquarter, New York as sub-office. Or headquarter in America.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tHare Krsna\n</p>\n",

In the Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Antya 4.176) it is said:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t”dvaite” bhadrābhadra-jñāna, saba——”manodharma”<br />\r\n\t”ei bhāla, ei manda”,——ei saba ”bhrama”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe distinctions between happiness and distress in the material world of duality are simply mental concoctions, for the so-called happiness and distress are actually one and the same. They are like the happiness and distress in dreams. A sleeping man creates his happiness and distress by dreaming, although actually they have no existence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe other example given in this verse is that a flower garland is originally very nice, but by mistake, for want of mature knowledge, one may consider it a snake. In this connection there is a statement by Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī: viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate. Everyone in this material world is distressed by miserable conditions, but Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī says that this world is full of happiness. How is this possible? He answers, yat- kāruṇya-katākṣa-vaibhavavatāṁ taṁ gauram eva stumaḥ. A devotee accepts the distress of this material world as happiness only due to the causeless mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By His personal behavior, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed that He was never distressed but always happy in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. One should follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and engage constantly in chanting the mahā-mantra—Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Then he will never feel the distresses of the world of duality. In any condition of life one will be happy if he chants the holy name of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes suffer as if one of our beloved family members had died. Because the same mind and body exist in the same material world of duality when we are awake, the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the false, superficial happiness of dreams. The mind is the via medium in both dreams and wakefulness, and everything created by the mind in terms of saṅkalpa and vikalpa, acceptance and rejection, is called manodharma, or mental concoction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHH Niranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Pranama Mantras)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst I would like to thank all of the assembled vaisnavas for this opportunity to render service. I pray to all of the vaisnavas who are here today to bless me that I may render this service with some devotion, for only then can these words be pleasing to the vaisnavas who are always eager to drink the nectar, honey, from the lotus feet of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI just noticed this morning that this verse is, interestingly, spoken by Lord Siva. Since today is also Sivaratri, it is appropriate to say something that he has given to us. It is also the Kirtan Mela and I've been requested to say something about the chanting of the holy name. I thought this verse was very appropriate because in the purport, Srila Prabhupada speaks very clearly about the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and how the holy name of the Lord can impact our lives, spiritually.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis verse, as we said, is spoken by Lord Siva. The setting is him sitting with Parvati on Mount Sumeru. As we know, Citraketu Maharaja had been flying above and was observing how Lord Siva was sitting with Parvati on his lap. He made some statement about that in a disparaging way. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that this was arranged by the Lord so that Citraketu Maharaja could very quickly be brought back to the spiritual world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Citraketu Maharaja had spoken in this way, Parvati had heard what he had said and was very disturbed that he was speaking this way about Lord Siva. After deliberation, she decided that she should curse Citraketu Maharaja to take birth as a demon. When Citraketu Maharaja heard the curse, he immediately came forward before Parvati and Lord Siva and spoke in a way of complete and full acceptance of the curse. Parvati was quite astonished. \"How is it that I've just cursed him to become a demon and he is so equipoised and so accepting of this curse?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Siva began to describe the characteristics of vaisnavas. He quoted the well-known verse that Srila Prabhupada would often quote:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati svargāpavarga-narakeṣv api tulyārtha-darśinaḥ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat the devotees do not fear any condition of life. Whether they are in Heaven, Hell, or liberated, for them it is all the same. Devotees are fixed and interested in only one thing and that is to be engaged in rendering service to the Lord. Therefore Lord Siva, after speaking this verse, spoke about how the living entities who are not fixed in devotional service have to live with the conception of duality.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen he spoke in this verse. This is the next verse which says that as one mistakenly considers a flower garland to be a snake, or experiences happiness or distress in a dream, so in the material world by a lack of careful consideration, we differentiate between happiness and distress, considering one good and the other bad.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the eleventh canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, there is an interesting verse in this connection. This verse was spoken in a conversation between Narada Muni and Vasudeva. Vasudeva was inquiring about the nature of devotional service and how, by engagement in devotional service, one can become free from fear. Narada Muni quoted a conversation which had taken place earlier between the nine Yogendras and King Nimi. King Nimi had inquired in a similar way about the characteristics of devotional service. In that conversation, Kavi, one of the nine Yogendras, explained to King Nimi about the nature of fear and how it arises due to misidentification with the material body, and by being influenced by the external energy of the Lord. Then he explains that this is the nature of fear, that when one turns away from Krsna he forgets his identity as the servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the next verse he explains the exact same point which is mentioned in today's verse. I'll quote the verse as I remember it in English and then I'll explain it because it is very enlightening. He says that although the duality of the material world does not ultimately exist, the conditioned soul considers it to be real, under the influence of his conditioned intelligence. This imaginary experience of a world which is separate from Krsna, can be compared to the acts of dreaming and desiring.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen a conditioned soul dreams at night of something very wonderful or something very horrible, or when he daydreams of something he would like to have, or something he would like to avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his imagination. The tendency of the mind is to accept and reject things on the basis of sense gratification. The intelligent person therefore must control the mind, restricting it from the tendency of being in the illusion of seeing things separate from Krsna. When the mind is thus controlled, one will become free from all fear. That is the verse.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow I will explain it. It is a long verse. The explanation is very interesting. When I give the explanation, I try to bring it down to something that is very tangible, something within our realm of experience. The verse is actually bringing it within our realm of experience when it talks about dreams.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada often would give an analogy about how beneficial analogies are. He gives the analogy that if one wants to see the movement of the moon in the sky, when looking at it directly, it's very difficult to see how the moon is moving. But when we look at the moon through the branches of a tree, it is much easier to see how the moon is moving. The branches are closer to us. They are closer to our experience. By seeing it through the branches we can see how it is moving.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the same way, the sage Kavi is giving us an analogy about the duality of the material world. He's comparing it to dreams. Have any of you ever had a dream before? I think some of you may have experienced this. The next question is “Have any of you ever had a bad dream before?” That is something within the realm of your experience. Have any of you ever had a good dream before? Yes. Something also within the realm of your experience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe sage, Kavi, is saying that when the conditioned soul dreams at night of something very wonderful or something very horrible, or when he daydreams of something he would like to have or avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his imagination.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow how is that? Just like, we may have a terrible dream. I've experienced it also. I fly a lot. I oftentimes experience that when I'm flying and I fall asleep I dream that the plane is dropping very fast. When I wake up, I'm happy. I feel very relieved. You may have had bad dreams. When you wake up you're very happy. You may have a good dream. I'm not going to explain what a good dream is. You have to consider it for yourself. Generally, a good dream is very enjoyable. When you wake up, \"Oh, it was only a dream.\" You're sad. But what is the nature of that happiness and sadness? It's not connected to reality. It's connected only to a dream. It has no connection to reality. We create a reality that has no existence beyond our imagination. Now that's the night dream.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKavi also speaks about the daydream. The daydream, as Srila Prabhupada also says right here in this purport, is no different than the night dream. During the daydream, we dream of something we would like to have or something we would like to avoid. Sometimes, the anticipation of attaining what we would like to have in our daydream brings us great happiness. After attaining it, oftentimes we realize that it's temporary and that realization in itself may lead to distress.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimilarly, in thinking to try and avoid certain things we dream, \"Oh yes. I've been able to avoid suffering. Therefore, I'm happy.\" Some people even define their happiness by the fact that they're not suffering. Somebody asks, \"Well, how are you, Prabhu?\" \"Oh, things are good. I'm not suffering.\" Therefore we live our life thinking about how to avoid suffering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is not a very good mission for life, simply trying to avoid suffering. There's more to life than avoiding suffering. We'll talk about that later in relationship to the holy name. The sage Kavi is explaining to us that both the happiness and the distress connected to the dream and the happiness and distress connected to the daydream creates a reality that has no existence beyond our imagination. Therefore the intelligent person must control the mind, restricting it from the tendency of seeing things separate from Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow, it's very interesting that Srila Prabhupada has also quoted in this commentary a verse spoken by Lord Caitanya. He has quoted the verse:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t'dvaite' bhadrābhadra-jñāna, saba — 'manodharma'<br />\r\n\t'ei bhāla, ei manda', — ei saba 'bhrama'\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat in this material world the conceptions of good and bad are all mental speculation. Therefore to say this is good and this is bad is all a mistake. It's interesting that the word that is used here is manodharma, the religion of the mind. This is the dharma of the mind, to see duality. He's speaking this verse to Sanatana Goswami. The body of Sanatana Goswami was filled with all kinds of sores due to drinking bad water in the forest of Jarikhanda. He was feeling very distressed that Lord Caitanya repeatedly seemed inclined to touch his body.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Caitanya was trying to explain to him, \"No. Your body is completely transcendental. Try to understand. Embracing your body is completely like nectar for me. I relish embracing your body. Even if your body was material, which it's not, in the material conception of life we should not think about good and bad.\" One verse is quoted from the Srimad Bhagavatam that anything that is not conceived in relationship to Krsna is understood to be illusion. None of the illusions either conceived in the mind or spoken by word are factual. Since illusions are not factual, there is no difference between what we think is good and what we think is bad. But when we think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead such speculations do not apply. Then He says this verse:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t'dvaite’ bhadrābhadra-jñāna saba-manodharma<br />\r\n\t‘ei bhāla ei manda’<br />\r\n\tei saba bhrama\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe should not think in terms of this is good and this is bad, when we think of it in relationship to the happiness and distress of the material world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore Srila Prabhupada has made a very interesting point in this commentary. He says that the devotee accepts the distress of this material world with happiness, only due to the causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He is not speaking about material happiness. We have already spoken about material happiness and material distress in the world of dualities. The devotee who has transcended the world of dualities knows that both the happiness and distress of this world are both miserable conditions of life. He wants nothing to do with the happiness and distress of the material world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRupa Goswami, in the Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, has defined three types of happiness. Happiness which is derived from sense enjoyment, happiness which is derived from liberation or from relief from the suffering of the material world, and happiness derived from devotional service. The happiness derived from devotional service is superior to the other forms of happiness. A devotee can accept the distress of this material world as happiness when he receives the causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada then quotes the verse by Prabhodananda Sarasvati Thakura:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-purakasa-puspayate durdantendriya-kala sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate<br />\r\n\tyat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnyone who receives the merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, then the conception of liberation, for him, is like hell. kaivalyam narakayate. And the pleasures of the heavenly world are like a dream. Such is the nature of the heavenly pleasures of the heavenly planets. Then he says that the venomous serpents of the senses will become like serpents with broken fangs. They will no longer have any poisonous effect. When the venomous fangs of the serpent are broken, they cannot strike on an object and have a poisonous effect whatsoever. visvam purna-sukhayate The whole universe becomes ecstatic. The positions of demigods are like positions of insects. This is the result of obtaining the merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, that merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is also made accessible to everyone by the manifestation of His holy names. As we know, the nature of Krsna's name is\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś<br />\r\n\tcaitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ<br />\r\n\tpūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto<br />\r\n\t’bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe holy name of Krsna is completely transcendental. It bestows all spiritual benedictions because it is Krsna Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not a material name under any circumstance. It is as powerful as Krsna, Himself. It is always eternal and liberated. This is the nature of Krsna's name. Krsna has so kindly made Himself accessible in His names.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tkali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara nama haite haya sarva-jagat-nistara\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the age of Kali, Krsna has manifested Himself in His name. For anyone who associates with His name, it's as good as associating with Him directly. Certainly, he is delivered. So the Lord has very kindly made Himself accessible to everyone in the form of His name.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs Srila Prabhupada explains in the commentary, and a very important point, that by His personal behavior, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed that He was never distressed, but always happy in chanting the Hare Krsna Mahamantra. One should follow in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and engage constantly in chanting His names. Lord Caitanya came to teach by His example. By His example, He showed that he was always relishing the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. By relishing it, He was making the sweet taste of Krsna's name available to others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis was Lord Caitanya's method of distributing the holy name. This was Lord Nityananda's method of distributing the holy name. This method of distributing the holy name was by first relishing it Himself, and then giving its sweet taste to others. Right here, Lord Caitanya in the house of Srivasa Thakura, would relish the holy names of the Lord every night in the association of His most confidential associates. Those who were not His confidential associates were not allowed to participate. But then after relishing the taste of these sweet names with His associates, He, along with His associates, went out and distributed that sweet taste to others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimilarly, all of us have gathered to relish the sweet taste of Krsna's names here in the association of devotees. But as servants of the holy name, we should never try to selfishly relish that sweet taste ourselves. Our duty is to go out and to give it to others. That is the auspiciousness of this event that has been created for all of us to take part into go together and to relish these sweet names. If we adopt the mood so nicely described by His Holiness Sacinandana Maharaja yesterday in his wonderful Srimad Bhagavatam class, of thinking of our- selves as very fallen and very much in need of mercy, and by qualifying ourselves in some way by prayer, intense chanting, and absorption, for the Lord to come down and to extend that mercy to us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is how we should be very eager to obtain the darshan of the Lord. Not that we should be so eager to see Him, but we should open up and purify our hearts in such a way that He becomes very eager to see us. He will come and very kindly distribute that mercy to everyone who opens their hearts in sincere prayer and chanting the holy names of the Lord. We should pray to serve the Lord and to please Him. Not only by getting the opportunity to taste the sweet name, but eagerly being given the opportunity to distribute it for the welfare of everyone. This is real service to the holy name.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is what Srila Prabhupada also came to teach by his example.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThank you very much. Hare Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n",

In the Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Antya 4.176) it is said:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t”dvaite” bhadrābhadra-jñāna, saba——”manodharma”<br />\n\t”ei bhāla, ei manda”,——ei saba ”bhrama”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe distinctions between happiness and distress in the material world of duality are simply mental concoctions, for the so-called happiness and distress are actually one and the same. They are like the happiness and distress in dreams. A sleeping man creates his happiness and distress by dreaming, although actually they have no existence.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other example given in this verse is that a flower garland is originally very nice, but by mistake, for want of mature knowledge, one may consider it a snake. In this connection there is a statement by Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī: viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate. Everyone in this material world is distressed by miserable conditions, but Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī says that this world is full of happiness. How is this possible? He answers, yat- kāruṇya-katākṣa-vaibhavavatāṁ taṁ gauram eva stumaḥ. A devotee accepts the distress of this material world as happiness only due to the causeless mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By His personal behavior, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed that He was never distressed but always happy in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. One should follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and engage constantly in chanting the mahā-mantra—Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Then he will never feel the distresses of the world of duality. In any condition of life one will be happy if he chants the holy name of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes suffer as if one of our beloved family members had died. Because the same mind and body exist in the same material world of duality when we are awake, the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the false, superficial happiness of dreams.

Therefore to say this is good and this is bad is all a mistake. It's interesting that the word that is used here is manodharma, the religion of the mind. This is the dharma of the mind, to see duality. He's speaking this verse to Sanatana Goswami. The body of Sanatana Goswami was filled with all kinds of sores due to drinking bad water in the forest of Jarikhanda. He was feeling very distressed that Lord Caitanya repeatedly seemed inclined to touch his body.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Caitanya was trying to explain to him, \"No. Your body is completely transcendental. Try to understand. Embracing your body is completely like nectar for me. I relish embracing your body. Even if your body was material, which it's not, in the material conception of life we should not think about good and bad.\" One verse is quoted from the Srimad Bhagavatam that anything that is not conceived in relationship to Krsna is understood to be illusion. None of the illusions either conceived in the mind or spoken by word are factual. Since illusions are not factual, there is no difference between what we think is good and what we think is bad. But when we think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead such speculations do not apply. Then He says this verse:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t'dvaite’ bhadrābhadra-jñāna saba-manodharma<br />\n\t‘ei bhāla ei manda’<br />\n\tei saba bhrama\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe should not think in terms of this is good and this is bad, when we think of it in relationship to the happiness and distress of the material world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore Srila Prabhupada has made a very interesting point in this commentary. He says that the devotee accepts the distress of this material world with happiness, only due to the causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He is not speaking about material happiness. We have already spoken about material happiness and material distress in the world of dualities. The devotee who has transcended the world of dualities knows that both the happiness and distress of this world are both miserable conditions of life. He wants nothing to do with the happiness and distress of the material world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRupa Goswami, in the Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, has defined three types of happiness. Happiness which is derived from sense enjoyment, happiness which is derived from liberation or from relief from the suffering of the material world, and happiness derived from devotional service. The happiness derived from devotional service is superior to the other forms of happiness. A devotee can accept the distress of this material world as happiness when he receives the causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada then quotes the verse by Prabhodananda Sarasvati Thakura:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-purakasa-puspayate durdantendriya-kala sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate<br />\n\tyat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyone who receives the merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, then the conception of liberation, for him, is like hell. kaivalyam narakayate. And the pleasures of the heavenly world are like a dream. Such is the nature of the heavenly pleasures of the heavenly planets. Then he says that the venomous serpents of the senses will become like serpents with broken fangs. They will no longer have any poisonous effect. When the venomous fangs of the serpent are broken, they cannot strike on an object and have a poisonous effect whatsoever. visvam purna-sukhayate The whole universe becomes ecstatic. The positions of demigods are like positions of insects. This is the result of obtaining the merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, that merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is also made accessible to everyone by the manifestation of His holy names. As we know, the nature of Krsna's name is\n</p>\n<p>\n\tnāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś<br />\n\tcaitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ<br />\n\tpūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto<br />\n\t’bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe holy name of Krsna is completely transcendental. It bestows all spiritual benedictions because it is Krsna Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not a material name under any circumstance. It is as powerful as Krsna, Himself. It is always eternal and liberated. This is the nature of Krsna's name. Krsna has so kindly made Himself accessible in His names.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tkali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara nama haite haya sarva-jagat-nistara\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the age of Kali, Krsna has manifested Himself in His name. For anyone who associates with His name, it's as good as associating with Him directly. Certainly, he is delivered. So the Lord has very kindly made Himself accessible to everyone in the form of His name.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Srila Prabhupada explains in the commentary, and a very important point, that by His personal behavior, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed that He was never distressed, but always happy in chanting the Hare Krsna Mahamantra. One should follow in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and engage constantly in chanting His names. Lord Caitanya came to teach by His example. By His example, He showed that he was always relishing the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. By relishing it, He was making the sweet taste of Krsna's name available to others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was Lord Caitanya's method of distributing the holy name. This was Lord Nityananda's method of distributing the holy name. This method of distributing the holy name was by first relishing it Himself, and then giving its sweet taste to others. Right here, Lord Caitanya in the house of Srivasa Thakura, would relish the holy names of the Lord every night in the association of His most confidential associates. Those who were not His confidential associates were not allowed to participate. But then after relishing the taste of these sweet names with His associates, He, along with His associates, went out and distributed that sweet taste to others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, all of us have gathered to relish the sweet taste of Krsna's names here in the association of devotees. But as servants of the holy name, we should never try to selfishly relish that sweet taste ourselves. Our duty is to go out and to give it to others. That is the auspiciousness of this event that has been created for all of us to take part into go together and to relish these sweet names. If we adopt the mood so nicely described by His Holiness Sacinandana Maharaja yesterday in his wonderful Srimad Bhagavatam class, of thinking of our- selves as very fallen and very much in need of mercy, and by qualifying ourselves in some way by prayer, intense chanting, and absorption, for the Lord to come down and to extend that mercy to us.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is how we should be very eager to obtain the darshan of the Lord. Not that we should be so eager to see Him, but we should open up and purify our hearts in such a way that He becomes very eager to see us. He will come and very kindly distribute that mercy to everyone who opens their hearts in sincere prayer and chanting the holy names of the Lord. We should pray to serve the Lord and to please Him. Not only by getting the opportunity to taste the sweet name, but eagerly being given the opportunity to distribute it for the welfare of everyone. This is real service to the holy name.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is what Srila Prabhupada also came to teach by his example.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tSince leaving Mayapura on December 3rd, I've been honoring prasadam with devotees practically every day. I like honoring prasadam with devotees, but I really miss listening to Srila Prabhupada's 1977 conversations during prasadam.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis morning, I was finally able to listen to Srila Prabhupada while taking breakfast. The following was part of a room conversation in Bhubanesvara on January 28, 1977. Srila Prabhupada is addressing a point which devotees oftentimes inquire about… the significance of dreams. Please read…\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: ...to show me. They were telling me that \"You are going to see the representative of God.\" And when I came to that vision, I saw the person. At that time I didn't know who was. But I had some doubts in my mind, and I was thinking, \"Oh, that's probably another kind of, you know, some kind of propaganda.\" This was all in the dream. But when I came to that person sitting on the elevated seat in that forest, surrounded by many, many devotees, that person looked at me and proved to me that he was the representative of God. But after, I forgot. Maybe one year or something like this. One or two years after...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: So there is no doubt about it that I am the representative of God.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes. But when I was...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Either you dream or not dream, I claim.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes. But the thing which was confirming, when I saw you the first time in Amsterdam, you were the same person that I saw in my dream that this one or two years previously.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: That... You have read Caitanya-caritamrta?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes, I have read this.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Guru-tattva. Guru-tattva. So there it is clearly said...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes, it is clearly explained.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: ...that guru is the manifestation of God. So it is confirmed in the sastra. And all the acaryas accept it. Yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSatsvarupa: But is it possible to also learn spiritual truths from this..., from representatives on the subtle plane?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: There is no question of subtle plane. You are on the gross plane. You first of all study gross things, and subtle, we shall see later on.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Of course, that was never a doubt. That's just the way I came in Krsna consciousness. And when I saw you...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: So the guru is the representative of God. That's all right. Then what is your misunderstanding?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: So then after I had some other things. For example, when I went to Egypt, in these pyramids one day I had some kind of contact on the subtle plane with persons who were supposed to live inside of the pyramids, and they gave me some kind of instructions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Inside of the pyramid?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes. That wasn't in the dream. But people, they were quite clear.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: These are just like we know gold and we know mountain...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: ...and sometimes we mix together and we see golden mountain. So in dream we see like that. We have got hundreds and thousands of experiences in our this life and past life. They are all stocked there, and they can sometimes get like a bubbles. You have seen the bubbles come out? It is like that. We should not give much importance to these things. But it is a fact that bona fide spiritual master is bona fide representative of Krsna. That's a fact. So there is no question of subtle or gross. It is a fact. That's all right.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSatsvarupa: But we've been discussing, and Prthu-putra Maharaja is saying that some devotees are very sensitive about thinking that they're having these experiences. And if we tell them, \"Ignore this. It's not important,\" that will not be good for them, because they are definitely feeling visits from persons from another plane, and if you simply tell them, \"No...\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: No, that's all right. You say that \"You are fortunate that you're having, but do your business.\" That's all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: They want to feel satisfaction from Krsna consciousness point of view.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: That's all right. Sometimes it may be fact. There is no wonder. But we have to proceed with the figure. If I dream that I am getting one lakh of rupees, so it is better if I get five rupees in figure. Is that all right?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Simply dreaming I am getting one lakh of rupees, that is good, or actually, if you get five rupees, that is good? Which is good?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: To get the actual five rupees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: So don't depend on the subtle thing. See practically what you are getting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSatsvarupa: What I thought was most dangerous is that...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Most dangerous... Those who are neophytes, they will be always in danger.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSatsvarupa: Sometimes these...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Always in danger, because they are neophytes. Just like a child is always in danger. So how you can save them? He's always in danger. So as far as possible, let us try. He's going to the fire. He's going to the water. He's going to the animal. He's eating some poison. So always in danger. That childish age is dangerous. Therefore mother takes care. Danger is already there because he's neophyte, kanistha-adhikari. Therefore we have to abide by the injunction of the sastra and guided by guru. That's all. That is our secure position. And otherwise danger always.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: One boy in Paris, he had a visit...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Whatever it may be, this is the position. Those who are neophyte, they are always in danger. Therefore their duty is to be guided by sadhu-sastra-guru. That's all. That is our...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: This is the reason why some of these people...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Now, I'll say from my practical life... It is not pride. Actually everyone knows that my Guru Maharaja had thousands of disciples. So out of thousands of disciples, practically I am little successful. That everyone knows. Why? Because I firmly believed in the words of my guru. That's all. This is the... There may be many other Godbrother, maybe very learned and very advanced, whatever it may be, favored, and... Everyone claims that \"I am the most favorite.\" And practical point of view... So I think sometimes that \"Why this wonderful thing has happened to me?\" So I search out. I search out only that I cent percent believe on the words of my spiritual... That's all, nothing else. Guru-mukha-padma-vakya, cittete koriya aikya, ara na koriho mane asa. Don't think of any nonsense. Simply execute what your guru has said. That is success. You are daily singing, guru-mukha-padma-vakya. You know the meaning?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes. Cittete koriya aikya, ara na koriho mane asa.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: This is the instruction. And the child decides it that \"Whatever my parent says, that's all I shall do. I shall do nothing,\" then he's safe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSatsvarupa: \"My only wish is to have my consciousness purified by the words emanating from his lotus mouth.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada: Then he's safe. And as soon as he manufactures -- finished. So don't do it. Yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau, tasyaite kathita... [SU 6.23]. This is the secret of spiritual success.\r\n</p>\r\n",

The following was part of a room conversation in Bhubanesvara on January 28, 1977. Srila Prabhupada is addressing a point which devotees oftentimes inquire about… the significance of dreams. Please read…\n</p>\n<p>\n\t \n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: ...to show me. They were telling me that \"You are going to see the representative of God.\" And when I came to that vision, I saw the person. At that time I didn't know who was. But I had some doubts in my mind, and I was thinking, \"Oh, that's probably another kind of, you know, some kind of propaganda.\" This was all in the dream. But when I came to that person sitting on the elevated seat in that forest, surrounded by many, many devotees, that person looked at me and proved to me that he was the representative of God. But after, I forgot. Maybe one year or something like this. One or two years after...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: So there is no doubt about it that I am the representative of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes. But when I was...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Either you dream or not dream, I claim.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes. But the thing which was confirming, when I saw you the first time in Amsterdam, you were the same person that I saw in my dream that this one or two years previously.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: That... You have read Caitanya-caritamrta?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes, I have read this.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Guru-tattva. Guru-tattva. So there it is clearly said...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes, it is clearly explained.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: ...that guru is the manifestation of God. So it is confirmed in the sastra. And all the acaryas accept it. Yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSatsvarupa: But is it possible to also learn spiritual truths from this..., from representatives on the subtle plane?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: There is no question of subtle plane. You are on the gross plane. You first of all study gross things, and subtle, we shall see later on.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Of course, that was never a doubt. That's just the way I came in Krsna consciousness. And when I saw you...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: So the guru is the representative of God. That's all right. Then what is your misunderstanding?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: So then after I had some other things. For example, when I went to Egypt, in these pyramids one day I had some kind of contact on the subtle plane with persons who were supposed to live inside of the pyramids, and they gave me some kind of instructions.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Inside of the pyramid?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes. That wasn't in the dream. But people, they were quite clear.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: These are just like we know gold and we know mountain...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: ...and sometimes we mix together and we see golden mountain. So in dream we see like that. We have got hundreds and thousands of experiences in our this life and past life. They are all stocked there, and they can sometimes get like a bubbles. You have seen the bubbles come out? It is like that. We should not give much importance to these things. But it is a fact that bona fide spiritual master is bona fide representative of Krsna. That's a fact. So there is no question of subtle or gross. It is a fact. That's all right.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSatsvarupa: But we've been discussing, and Prthu-putra Maharaja is saying that some devotees are very sensitive about thinking that they're having these experiences. And if we tell them, \"Ignore this. It's not important,\" that will not be good for them, because they are definitely feeling visits from persons from another plane, and if you simply tell them, \"No...\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: No, that's all right. You say that \"You are fortunate that you're having, but do your business.\" That's all.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: They want to feel satisfaction from Krsna consciousness point of view.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: That's all right. Sometimes it may be fact. There is no wonder. But we have to proceed with the figure. If I dream that I am getting one lakh of rupees, so it is better if I get five rupees in figure. Is that all right?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Simply dreaming I am getting one lakh of rupees, that is good, or actually, if you get five rupees, that is good? Which is good?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: To get the actual five rupees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: So don't depend on the subtle thing. See practically what you are getting.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSatsvarupa: What I thought was most dangerous is that...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Most dangerous... Those who are neophytes, they will be always in danger.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSatsvarupa: Sometimes these...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Always in danger, because they are neophytes. Just like a child is always in danger. So how you can save them? He's always in danger. So as far as possible, let us try. He's going to the fire. He's going to the water. He's going to the animal. He's eating some poison. So always in danger. That childish age is dangerous. Therefore mother takes care. Danger is already there because he's neophyte, kanistha-adhikari. Therefore we have to abide by the injunction of the sastra and guided by guru. That's all. That is our secure position. And otherwise danger always.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: One boy in Paris, he had a visit...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Whatever it may be, this is the position. Those who are neophyte, they are always in danger. Therefore their duty is to be guided by sadhu-sastra-guru. That's all. That is our...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: This is the reason why some of these people...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Now, I'll say from my practical life... It is not pride. Actually everyone knows that my Guru Maharaja had thousands of disciples. So out of thousands of disciples, practically I am little successful. That everyone knows. Why? Because I firmly believed in the words of my guru. That's all. This is the... There may be many other Godbrother, maybe very learned and very advanced, whatever it may be, favored, and... Everyone claims that \"I am the most favorite.\" And practical point of view... So I think sometimes that \"Why this wonderful thing has happened to me?\" So I search out. I search out only that I cent percent believe on the words of my spiritual... That's all, nothing else. Guru-mukha-padma-vakya, cittete koriya aikya, ara na koriho mane asa. Don't think of any nonsense. Simply execute what your guru has said. That is success. You are daily singing, guru-mukha-padma-vakya. You know the meaning?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrthu-putra: Yes. Cittete koriya aikya, ara na koriho mane asa.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: This is the instruction. And the child decides it that \"Whatever my parent says, that's all I shall do. I shall do nothing,\" then he's safe.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSatsvarupa: \"My only wish is to have my consciousness purified by the words emanating from his lotus mouth.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada: Then he's safe. And as soon as he manufactures -- finished. So don't do it. Yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau, tasyaite kathita... [SU 6.23]. This is the secret of spiritual success.\n</p>\n",

It is recommended to rest for the same period of time as the actual treatment in order to get the full benefit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately, we've not had an internet connection strong enough for uploading any audio or video files. Madana-mohana dasa tried several times in Coimbatore and I've tried several times here in Mayapura, but neither of us met with any success. Unless something better appears, it seems as though there will be no audio or video files posted until early December.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther than submitting myself fully to treatment, my time in Coimbatore was mostly uneventful. I managed to read the last two volumes of Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita and I also listened to hours and hours of 1977 room conversations with Srila Prabhupada. Since the doctors strongly recommend to minimize time on the computer as much as possible during the intensive part of the treatment, I also did some minimal work for Russian Gauranga Press and a small amount of correspondence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlmost every evening Sivarama Maharaja, Badrinarayan Maharaja, and myself would come together in Sivarama Maharaja's residence for an hour of philosophical discussion and then Damodarastakam. After our discussions, anywhere from eight to fifteen devotees would come from the Coimbatore temple congregation for chanting Damodarastakam and offering dhipa. Sivarama Maharaja always travels with Radha Damodara. Wherever he goes, he sets up Their altar and performs Their daily puja. So having Radha Damdodara right in Coimbatore during Kartika was a special treat for these devotees. Every day they provided bhoga for the Deities' offering and beautiful, fragrant flower garlands for the Deities as well as for the altar. They also prepared a hill of prasadam for Them right there in Sivarama Maharaja's residence on Govardhana Puja. Madana Mohana dasa shot a video of our Govardhana Puja in the clinic which will eventually be uploaded to Youtube and this site.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs for the treatment, only time will tell if the improvements will remain stable. The most serious problem is, still, poor digestion, which then affects other bodily functions, including blood pressure. The good news is that my blood pressure during the whole treatment was steadily hovering around 110/70, which is the best I've seen in many years. By the time I left the clinic, there were other signs of improvement. But since it doesn't take much to get set back again, I'm trying to be very careful during this crucial time before I start traveling again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo days ago, Bhavananda Prabhu and Sadbhuja Prabhu took Sivarama Maharaja and myself on a tour of the construction site for the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium. The stainless steel dome is almost done. The projected date of completion of the dome is Gaura Purnima, at which time they are hoping to install the chakra on top of the dome. The whole superstructure is also almost complete. Included within our tour, therefore, was the opportunity to see the work in progress of the sculpting and casting of the full parampara who will be on first altar. We were also shown how the glass reinforced concrete was being developed and cast by devotees for much of the finish work throughout the whole building. A scale model of the planetarium was also shown to us enabling us to get a slight glimpse of what the full-scale model will look like within the main temple. Many photographs were taken of our tour. If they can be uploaded here, they will be found in the photos section. Otherwise, they may also have to wait until early December. Devotees should definitely find a means to contribute to this very important project.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo days ago, I also received a copy of \"Swamiji\", memories of Brahmananda Prabhu about his early years with Srila Prabhupada. Naturally, it didn't take long for me to immerse myself in this new addition to the many books written about the early days with Srila Prabhupada. It just so happens that Brahmananda Prabhu is one of my favorites when it comes to hearing about those early days. My experience with Brahmananda Prabhu is that he remembers so many details about those precious days when ISKCON was just beginning. Whenever I would be with him, I would always try to extract as much as I could from his memory. He very kindly autographed the book for me when he was told it was being purchased for me. I was very moved by what he had written inside, \"For Niranjana Maharaja. Your Vyasa Puja offering this year was the best. Brahmananda dasa, Karttika, Vrindavan Dhama, 28/10/14.\" I took it as encouragement from a very senior godbrother.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'll probably finish \"Swamiji\" by tonight and then tomorrow I will get the opportunity to start reading the two-volume book entitled \"Yamuni Devi, A Life of Unalloyed Devotion\", which was also brought for me from Vrndavana by Karabhajana Prabhu. Yamuni devi is another devotee who had so much personal association with Srila Prabhupada. I'm looking forward to reading about the life of this very serious devotee, and especially about her experiences in Srila Prabhupada's association. Whenever I would talk with Yamuna, she was only interested in discussing the holy name, a topic which seemed to becoming increasingly important to her. She had been in poor health for many years, although she would never show it… at least to me. She just wanted to talk about the power of Krsna's names. I'm sure I will find many references to her eagerness for chanting inside the book.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor now, that's all I'll write for an update. More will come soon. I'll also be back on the road again soon and will have an itinerary for posting soon too.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

Needless to say, my body was jet-lagged and exhausted from am exceptionally intense visit to North America. As always, my visit to United States was rewarding, but nonetheless still intense, although Govinda Datta dasa's presence as an assistant and driver was a \"life-saver\" for me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOut of necessity, I've decided to take advantage of the quiet facility I have been offered here to rest for a few days, read, and to catch up on correspondence before my GBC meetings in India begin the beginning of next week. My programs in Almaty will be on Thursday and Friday. I'm scheduled to fly to India on Saturday.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the one week of GBC meetings and then three weeks in the clinic, I will not have that much time for anything else. I do hope, however, to finally get some time to start posting blogs again once I'm in the clinic. I always prefer to keep up with it on a regular basis, but as all of you can see, my ability to do so is irregular, at best.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI started to listen to Srila Prabhupada audio files once again, especially while taking prasadam. Yesterday evening I listened to a room conversation in Vrndavana on June 26, 1977. About two weeks ago, Sivarama Maharaja recommended me to listen to it, but this was the first chance I got to find the file and to listen to it without distraction. Tamal Krsna Maharaja was reading the most wonderful letter written to Srila Prabhupada by the former \"Ghanasyama dasa\", later to become H.H. Bhakti-tirtha Swami. It was such a moving letter in which Bhakti-tirtha Maharaja was describing his experiences from distributing sets of Srila Prabhupada's books to scholars and professors in Yugoslavia…. at that time, under Communist rule. I've attached a file to this blog which contains the ten-minute reading of this letter. For those who understand English, please download and listen to it. I'm quite sure you will not regret it. I could not hold back the tears as I listened while envisioning Srila Prabhupada's pleasure from hearing this most sincere letter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI would also like to take this opportunity to mention that a newsletter will soon be sent by email to everyone whose name and email address is in the current mailing list. If you are unsure whether this information is in the mailing list or not, then you may wish to add both by entering the information into the appropriate spaces on the left side of this page.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

As always, my visit to United States was rewarding, but nonetheless still intense, although Govinda Datta dasa's presence as an assistant and driver was a \"life-saver\" for me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOut of necessity, I've decided to take advantage of the quiet facility I have been offered here to rest for a few days, read, and to catch up on correspondence before my GBC meetings in India begin the beginning of next week. My programs in Almaty will be on Thursday and Friday. I'm scheduled to fly to India on Saturday.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the one week of GBC meetings and then three weeks in the clinic, I will not have that much time for anything else. I do hope, however, to finally get some time to start posting blogs again once I'm in the clinic. I always prefer to keep up with it on a regular basis, but as all of you can see, my ability to do so is irregular, at best.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI started to listen to Srila Prabhupada audio files once again, especially while taking prasadam. Yesterday evening I listened to a room conversation in Vrndavana on June 26, 1977. About two weeks ago, Sivarama Maharaja recommended me to listen to it, but this was the first chance I got to find the file and to listen to it without distraction. Tamal Krsna Maharaja was reading the most wonderful letter written to Srila Prabhupada by the former \"Ghanasyama dasa\", later to become H.H. Bhakti-tirtha Swami. It was such a moving letter in which Bhakti-tirtha Maharaja was describing his experiences from distributing sets of Srila Prabhupada's books to scholars and professors in Yugoslavia…. at that time, under Communist rule. I've attached a file to this blog which contains the ten-minute reading of this letter. For those who understand English, please download and listen to it. I'm quite sure you will not regret it. I could not hold back the tears as I listened while envisioning Srila Prabhupada's pleasure from hearing this most sincere letter.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI would also like to take this opportunity to mention that a newsletter will soon be sent by email to everyone whose name and email address is in the current mailing list. If you are unsure whether this information is in the mailing list or not, then you may wish to add both by entering the information into the appropriate spaces on the left side of this page.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is a partially edited transcription of a lecture given in New Vraja Dhama on September 14, 2013, Srimati Radharani's Appearance Day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'll speak just a little bit about Srimati Radharani today because it's Her appearance day. But when I look at my own qualification for speaking on such an elevated topic as this, I feel very unqualified to do so. Who am I to speak about the glories of Srimati Radharani? If Krsna is so difficult to understand, just imagine how difficult it is to understand Radharani?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnless one gets a drop of mercy from Krsna's lotus feet we can never understand Krsna's greatness. So what to speak of understanding Srimati Radharani's greatness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRadharani is the embodiment of mercy and compassion. It is one of Her qualities. She is Krsna's compassion personified because She has Krsna under Her control and She can claim possession of Krsna. She can say Krsna is Mine. So anyone who can say, \"Krsna is Mine\" has the power to give Krsna to others and there is nobody who can stake a claim that \"Krsna is Mine\" more than Srimati Radharani. She knows how to please Krsna better than anyone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is a verse in Caitanya Caritamrita:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tgovindanandini radha, govinda-mohini<br />\r\n\tgovinda-sarvasva, sarva-kanta-siromani<br />\r\n\t(Caitanya Caritamrita, Adi 4.82)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Radha, She is the one who can please Krsna. And She is the one who completely enchants Krsna. She is the be-all and end-all of Govinda. And She is the crest jewel of all of Krsna's consorts.\"&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo because She has the capacity to serve Krsna in the greatest way, which means that Her service is most pleasing to Him, then if anyone could have any hope of doing something that would be pleasing to Krsna, an intelligent person should be thinking, \"Let me try to get Srimati Radharani's attention. Let me do something that would assist her in pleasing Krsna because who am I to please Krsna?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI think it was Tamal Krsna Maharaja, who once told the following story about Prabhupada. Prabhupada was looking at a painting of the gopis for a new publication. While gazing at the picture, he was expressing how pleased he was with it. It was picture of all the gopis standing in the background and they are pushing Radharani forward. Prabhupada said, \"Yes. This is very nice. This is how a devotee thinks. How to push others forward.\" In other words, these gopis don't even want to be directly connected to Krsna. Their greatest happiness is connecting Radharani with Krsna. And if they can always be in the background doing this, they have no greater pleasure than this.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Prabhupada was saying, \"Yes. This is the mood of a devotee.\" He was very pleased with the painting. He said, \"We should always be eager stay in the background and push others forward in their service to Krsna.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Radharani is so merciful, so magnanimous, that She gets a pleasure ten million times greater by making different arrangements to bring the gopis to Krsna… a pleasure even greater than Herself being personally present with Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnana-cchale krsne preri' sangama karaya<br />\r\n\tatma-krsna-sanga haite koti-sukha paya\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Presenting various pleas for the gopis, Srimati Radharani sometimes sends the gopis to Krsna just to enable them to associate with Him directly. At such times, She enjoys a happiness ten million times greater than that enjoyed through direct association.\" (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 8.213)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo just consider how magnanimous She is. And just consider, how could Radharani get a pleasure ten million times greater than being directly with Krsna unless Krsna was pleased with Her service?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo this is how magnanimous Radharani is. Although the gopis always want to stay in the background and bring Radharani to Krsna because She knows how to please Krsna the best, and She definitely pleases Krsna the best, still She is pleased even more by making different arrangements to have the gopis meet with Krsna too.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, in this way, She is most merciful and very compassionate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was just looking at this before I came. Prabhupada says in the \"Nectar of Devotion\" about compassion. He is talking about Krsna's compassion. And he described how Krsna's compassion was exhibited before Bhismadeva.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Bhisma was lying on his bed of arrows, Krsna forgot His own position. He was so eager to come before Bhismadeva that He just completely forgot His own position as the Supreme Lord and hastily went to be before him as he was passing from this world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Krsna saw Bhisma's pitiable condition, He began to speak with tears in His eyes. And Prabhupada said that He also forgot Himself in His compassion. He says, \"Therefore instead of offering obeisances to Krsna directly, devotees offer obeisances to His compassionate nature.\" (NOD, Chapter 22)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is very difficult to approach Him. But the devotees, taking advantage of His compassionate nature which is represented by Radharani, always pray to Radharani for Krsna's compassion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Prabhupada is explaining that Radharani is the representative, of Krsna's compassion. Therefore, if we are thinking that we want to do something that is pleasing to Krsna, and if we want to give something to Krsna, then it is considered to be better to go to Radharani, and give it to her and say, \"Can you please recommend me to Krsna?\" If Radharani recommends someone to Krsna, Krsna can't refuse. She controls Krsna. How can He refuse if Radharani recommends?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor instance, Krsna says, \"if you offer Me a leaf, flower, fruit, or water, with love and devotion, I will accept.\" But if we have a flower or leaf and give it to Srimati Radharani, asking, \"Can you please offer this to Krsna?\" then what better way to give something to Krsna and to get recognized if Radharani makes some recommendation on our behalf?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada also says something very wonderful about Radharani, which I'll repeat here and then I'll end because Candramauli Maharaja is supposed to speak and we are supposed to end by 11:00.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada on Radhastami day, he was giving a lecture, obviously about Radharani. So he says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"So our today prayer to Radharani, we pray to Radharani because She is the pleasure potency of Krsna.\" Radharani is the personification of Krsna's pleasure potency.\" (end of quote)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna He has three primary potencies….sat, cit, and ananda or His sandhini potency, His samvit potency, and His hladini potency. This sat potency is His aspect of eternality. The personification of His sandhini potency is Lord Balarama. Lord Balarama, creates all the different varieties of the spiritual world. And whatever is created, has some form. All the form and all of the varieties of the spiritual world are manifest by Balarama, who assists the Lord in this way. And therefore He is the personification of this sandhini potency.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe samvit potency is knowledge. Sat, cit, knowledge, and ananda. So the personification of the cit potency is Krsna Himself. And another manifestation of knowledge in the spiritual world is to know what is our relationship with Krsna. That is called sambandha. Sambandha means to know what is my relationship with Krsna. But this samvit potency in the spiritual world, is manifest by knowing that \"Krsna is my friend.\" Balarama thinks, \"Krsna is My brother.\" Yasoda thinks, \"Krsna is my son.\" That is the perfect manifestion of the samvit potency. Their knowledge is complete. They don't need to know anything else. They don't even know how great they are. All they know is their ecstasy in knowing Krsna. That's all. As \"my friend,\" \"my lover,\" \"my son.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact, their knowledge is considered to be the highest knowledge. The highest knowledge is called jnana sunya. Do you know what jnana sunya means? Anyone know? Manjari knows. Zero knowledge. Right. The highest knowledge is that they have no knowledge. That's the highest. Imagine. There are different methods of obtaining knowledge through different stages. For instance, there is pratyaksa, obtaining knowledge through sense perception. And then there is receiving knowledge through hearing. And then there's the knowledge that's received through realization. Then there's platform which is called adhoksaja, which is the knowledge gained by understanding the expanse of the spiritual world. We can't obtain that adhoksaja by mental speculation. Neither can we force it to be manifest, to be revealed in our hearts. It is manifest only by divine mercy. And therefore we can only pray to qualify for that mercy to be able to understand the expanse of the spiritual world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut that's not the highest. There's another platform which is even higher. It is called kevala, or jnana sunya. It means to have no knowledge. To be completely devoid of the knowledge of Krsna's aisvarya, which are His opulences. To not know that Krsna is God. To even hear it suggested is a disturbance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Uddhava tried to suggest to Nanda Maharaja about the glories of his son, Nanda Maharaja objected. He said, \"What are you trying to say? My son is God? What do you take me for? How could He be God? Every morning He carries my shoes on His head? How could you say He's God? God is the Supreme Absolute Truth. I've never seen anyone who lies better than my son.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNanda Maharaja really objects. He says to Uddhava, \"You're trying to make me feel better by telling me how great a son I have, but you're making me miserable. All I know is that He's my son and I miss Him. Where did He go? Doesn't He remember His parents? Wherever I go, all I see is my son. I leave the house to try to forget about Him, but I see the forest, I see the pasturing grounds, I see the cows, but all this makes me think of my son.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is what Nanda Maharaja knows. That's all he needs to know. Jnana sunya. He knows nothing about Krsna's opulences. All he knows is that \"Krsna is my son.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo this is the samvit potency. This is the most complete knowledge to have. And Radharani, She is the personification of Krsna's hladini potency. When Krsna wants to enjoy… of course Prabhupada always explains that when we use this word \"when\" it could be quite confusing. Because as soon as we say \"when\" it suggests that there is some beginning point. What do you mean, \"When Krsna wants to enjoy?\" Never is there a time when He is not enjoying. So how can we say, \"when\" Krsna wants to enjoy? But we have to say it. But please try to understand, Krsna is always enjoying.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo when Krsna enjoys, He can't enjoy anything of this material world. There is nothing in this world that's attractive to Him. When He comes to world, He is not attracted to anything in this world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe were just speaking the other day about this in class. Prabhupada said that when Krsna comes to deliver the sadhus, he was quoting the verse paritranaya sadhunam, vinasaya ca duskritam. So he said that \"actually Krsna doesn't come to deliver the sadhus because the sadhus are already delivered.\" And then he explained who is a sadhu. He said that \"the sadhu is not merely a worldly moralist. The sadhu is a devotee. And a devotee \"sa gunan samatityaitan\" (Bg 14.26) A devotee is above the modes of material nature. He is not in the modes of material nature. He is already transcendental.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo how can we say that Krsna is coming to deliver the sadhus? The sadhus are already delivered. He says therefore that when Krsna comes, He is coming for some inner purpose. He wants to satisfy the innermost desires of His devotees. He wants to allow Himself to be seen by them. And therefore He comes for that purpose. Because the devotees' hearts are already completely pure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore when Krsna comes, He comes, not because He has any interest in this material world. Because there is nothing material that can attract Him. Only His devotee can attract Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut which devotee can attract Krsna more than Radharani? So She is the personification of Krsna's pleasure potency. and therefore Prabhupada is saying here:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"We pray to Radharani because She is the pleasure potency of Krsna. Krsna means \"all-attractive.\" But Radharani is so great that She attracts Krsna. Krsna is all-attractive, and She is attractive [attractor] of Krsna. So what is the position of Srimati Radharani? We should try to understand this day and offer our obeisances to Radharani. Radhe vrndavanesvari.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttapta-kancana-gaurangi radhe vrndavanesvari<br />\r\n\tvrsabhanu-sute devi pranamami hari-priye\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur business is 'Radharani, You are so dear to Krsna. You are the daughter of King Vrsabhanu and You are so dear to Krsna. So we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.'\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttapta-kancana-gaurangi radhe vrndavanesvari<br />\r\n\tvrsabhanu-sute devi pranamami hari-priye\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[I offer my respects to Radharani, whose bodily complexion is like molten gold and who is the Queen of Vrndavana. You are the daughter of King Vrsabhanu, and You are very dear to Lord Krsna.]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRadharani is hari-priya, very dear to Krsna. So if we approach Krsna through Radharani, through the mercy of Radharani, then it becomes very easy. If Radharani recommends that 'This devotee is very nice,' then Krsna immediately accepts, however fool I may be.\" (Radhastami -- London, August 29, 1971)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat's the part that really struck me. I had to lead up to that point. We tend to think \"I have to be something pretty great for Radharani to recommend me.\" But Prabhupada is saying, no, however much of a fool I may be, Krsna will accept. That is her magnanimity. She is the topmost mahabhagavata. She thinks everyone is serving Krsna except Herself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo even if I'm the greatest fool and even if we have no qualification, if somehow we can can just make an appeal to Her, pray for Her mercy, do something, anything that could possibly please Her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRadharani is not going to recognize us by some external show. These things don't attract Her. But if we want to do something to assist Her in pleasing Krsna, we must remember that She is magnanimity personified. And of course, the greatest manifestation of Her mercy is found in Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Who is Krsna Himself, and Who accepted the bhava, the mood of Radharani.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Prabhupada is explaining this point here. He says, \"However fool I may be, if we try to catch Radharani's mercy it will be very easy.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada continues, \"Therefore in Vrndavana you'll find all the devotees, they're chanting more Radharani's name than Krsna's. Wherever you'll go, you'll find the devotees are addressing, \"Jaya Radhe.\" You'll find still in Vrndavana. They are glorifying Radharani. They're more interested, worshiping Radharani. Because however fallen I may be, if some way or other I can please Radharani, then it is very easy for me to understand Krsna.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we should meditate on Radharani in this way. We should meditate on Her mercy and her magnanimity and her compassion. And her mood. Her mood, is \"let Me bring others forward to please Krsna.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tgopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah<br />\r\n\t(Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 13.80)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"I identify Myself only as the servant of the servant of the servant of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, the maintainer of the gopis.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the proper mood. To bring others forward. And Radharani gets a pleasure ten million times greater by bringing others forward in their relationship with Krsna. This is how we can get Radharani's attention. It's not so cheap. It's not that you can just raise your hands and get attention. If you want to get Her attention, then understand Her mood. \"Let others go forward. Let me stay behind. Let me bring them forward. Let me please Her and let me stay even farther behind. She knows. She will recognize.\" We will get Her mercy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this way, if we remember this on this auspicious day, and remember Her magnanimity and compassion and Her mercy, then even an unqualified fool can remember something about Radharani. OK? It's 11:00. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n",

He said, \"We should always be eager stay in the background and push others forward in their service to Krsna.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Radharani is so merciful, so magnanimous, that She gets a pleasure ten million times greater by making different arrangements to bring the gopis to Krsna… a pleasure even greater than Herself being personally present with Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tnana-cchale krsne preri' sangama karaya<br />\n\tatma-krsna-sanga haite koti-sukha paya\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Presenting various pleas for the gopis, Srimati Radharani sometimes sends the gopis to Krsna just to enable them to associate with Him directly. At such times, She enjoys a happiness ten million times greater than that enjoyed through direct association.\" (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 8.213)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo just consider how magnanimous She is. And just consider, how could Radharani get a pleasure ten million times greater than being directly with Krsna unless Krsna was pleased with Her service?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is how magnanimous Radharani is. Although the gopis always want to stay in the background and bring Radharani to Krsna because She knows how to please Krsna the best, and She definitely pleases Krsna the best, still She is pleased even more by making different arrangements to have the gopis meet with Krsna too.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, in this way, She is most merciful and very compassionate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was just looking at this before I came.

She controls Krsna. How can He refuse if Radharani recommends?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor instance, Krsna says, \"if you offer Me a leaf, flower, fruit, or water, with love and devotion, I will accept.\" But if we have a flower or leaf and give it to Srimati Radharani, asking, \"Can you please offer this to Krsna?\" then what better way to give something to Krsna and to get recognized if Radharani makes some recommendation on our behalf?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada also says something very wonderful about Radharani, which I'll repeat here and then I'll end because Candramauli Maharaja is supposed to speak and we are supposed to end by 11:00.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada on Radhastami day, he was giving a lecture, obviously about Radharani. So he says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"So our today prayer to Radharani, we pray to Radharani because She is the pleasure potency of Krsna.\" Radharani is the personification of Krsna's pleasure potency.\" (end of quote)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna He has three primary potencies….sat, cit, and ananda or His sandhini potency, His samvit potency, and His hladini potency. This sat potency is His aspect of eternality. The personification of His sandhini potency is Lord Balarama. Lord Balarama, creates all the different varieties of the spiritual world. And whatever is created, has some form. All the form and all of the varieties of the spiritual world are manifest by Balarama, who assists the Lord in this way. And therefore He is the personification of this sandhini potency.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe samvit potency is knowledge. Sat, cit, knowledge, and ananda. So the personification of the cit potency is Krsna Himself. And another manifestation of knowledge in the spiritual world is to know what is our relationship with Krsna. That is called sambandha. Sambandha means to know what is my relationship with Krsna. But this samvit potency in the spiritual world, is manifest by knowing that \"Krsna is my friend.\" Balarama thinks, \"Krsna is My brother.\" Yasoda thinks, \"Krsna is my son.\" That is the perfect manifestion of the samvit potency. Their knowledge is complete. They don't need to know anything else. They don't even know how great they are. All they know is their ecstasy in knowing Krsna. That's all. As \"my friend,\" \"my lover,\" \"my son.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, their knowledge is considered to be the highest knowledge. The highest knowledge is called jnana sunya. Do you know what jnana sunya means? Anyone know? Manjari knows. Zero knowledge. Right. The highest knowledge is that they have no knowledge. That's the highest. Imagine. There are different methods of obtaining knowledge through different stages. For instance, there is pratyaksa, obtaining knowledge through sense perception. And then there is receiving knowledge through hearing. And then there's the knowledge that's received through realization. Then there's platform which is called adhoksaja, which is the knowledge gained by understanding the expanse of the spiritual world. We can't obtain that adhoksaja by mental speculation. Neither can we force it to be manifest, to be revealed in our hearts. It is manifest only by divine mercy. And therefore we can only pray to qualify for that mercy to be able to understand the expanse of the spiritual world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that's not the highest. There's another platform which is even higher. It is called kevala, or jnana sunya. It means to have no knowledge. To be completely devoid of the knowledge of Krsna's aisvarya, which are His opulences. To not know that Krsna is God. To even hear it suggested is a disturbance.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Uddhava tried to suggest to Nanda Maharaja about the glories of his son, Nanda Maharaja objected. He said, \"What are you trying to say? My son is God? What do you take me for? How could He be God? Every morning He carries my shoes on His head? How could you say He's God? God is the Supreme Absolute Truth. I've never seen anyone who lies better than my son.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNanda Maharaja really objects. He says to Uddhava, \"You're trying to make me feel better by telling me how great a son I have, but you're making me miserable. All I know is that He's my son and I miss Him. Where did He go? Doesn't He remember His parents? Wherever I go, all I see is my son. I leave the house to try to forget about Him, but I see the forest, I see the pasturing grounds, I see the cows, but all this makes me think of my son.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is what Nanda Maharaja knows. That's all he needs to know. Jnana sunya. He knows nothing about Krsna's opulences. All he knows is that \"Krsna is my son.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is the samvit potency. This is the most complete knowledge to have. And Radharani, She is the personification of Krsna's hladini potency. When Krsna wants to enjoy… of course Prabhupada always explains that when we use this word \"when\" it could be quite confusing. Because as soon as we say \"when\" it suggests that there is some beginning point. What do you mean, \"When Krsna wants to enjoy?\" Never is there a time when He is not enjoying. So how can we say, \"when\" Krsna wants to enjoy? But we have to say it. But please try to understand, Krsna is always enjoying.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when Krsna enjoys, He can't enjoy anything of this material world. There is nothing in this world that's attractive to Him. When He comes to world, He is not attracted to anything in this world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe were just speaking the other day about this in class. Prabhupada said that when Krsna comes to deliver the sadhus, he was quoting the verse paritranaya sadhunam, vinasaya ca duskritam. So he said that \"actually Krsna doesn't come to deliver the sadhus because the sadhus are already delivered.\" And then he explained who is a sadhu. He said that \"the sadhu is not merely a worldly moralist. The sadhu is a devotee. And a devotee \"sa gunan samatityaitan\" (Bg 14.26) A devotee is above the modes of material nature. He is not in the modes of material nature. He is already transcendental.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo how can we say that Krsna is coming to deliver the sadhus? The sadhus are already delivered. He says therefore that when Krsna comes, He is coming for some inner purpose. He wants to satisfy the innermost desires of His devotees. He wants to allow Himself to be seen by them. And therefore He comes for that purpose. Because the devotees' hearts are already completely pure.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore when Krsna comes, He comes, not because He has any interest in this material world. Because there is nothing material that can attract Him. Only His devotee can attract Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut which devotee can attract Krsna more than Radharani? So She is the personification of Krsna's pleasure potency. and therefore Prabhupada is saying here:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We pray to Radharani because She is the pleasure potency of Krsna. Krsna means \"all-attractive.\" But Radharani is so great that She attracts Krsna. Krsna is all-attractive, and She is attractive [attractor] of Krsna. So what is the position of Srimati Radharani? We should try to understand this day and offer our obeisances to Radharani. Radhe vrndavanesvari.\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttapta-kancana-gaurangi radhe vrndavanesvari<br />\n\tvrsabhanu-sute devi pranamami hari-priye\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOur business is 'Radharani, You are so dear to Krsna. You are the daughter of King Vrsabhanu and You are so dear to Krsna. So we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttapta-kancana-gaurangi radhe vrndavanesvari<br />\n\tvrsabhanu-sute devi pranamami hari-priye\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[I offer my respects to Radharani, whose bodily complexion is like molten gold and who is the Queen of Vrndavana. You are the daughter of King Vrsabhanu, and You are very dear to Lord Krsna.]\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRadharani is hari-priya, very dear to Krsna. So if we approach Krsna through Radharani, through the mercy of Radharani, then it becomes very easy. If Radharani recommends that 'This devotee is very nice,' then Krsna immediately accepts, however fool I may be.\" (Radhastami -- London, August 29, 1971)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat's the part that really struck me. I had to lead up to that point. We tend to think \"I have to be something pretty great for Radharani to recommend me.\" But Prabhupada is saying, no, however much of a fool I may be, Krsna will accept. That is her magnanimity. She is the topmost mahabhagavata. She thinks everyone is serving Krsna except Herself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo even if I'm the greatest fool and even if we have no qualification, if somehow we can can just make an appeal to Her, pray for Her mercy, do something, anything that could possibly please Her.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRadharani is not going to recognize us by some external show. These things don't attract Her. But if we want to do something to assist Her in pleasing Krsna, we must remember that She is magnanimity personified. And of course, the greatest manifestation of Her mercy is found in Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Who is Krsna Himself, and Who accepted the bhava, the mood of Radharani.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Prabhupada is explaining this point here. He says, \"However fool I may be, if we try to catch Radharani's mercy it will be very easy.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada continues, \"Therefore in Vrndavana you'll find all the devotees, they're chanting more Radharani's name than Krsna's. Wherever you'll go, you'll find the devotees are addressing, \"Jaya Radhe.\" You'll find still in Vrndavana. They are glorifying Radharani. They're more interested, worshiping Radharani. Because however fallen I may be, if some way or other I can please Radharani, then it is very easy for me to understand Krsna.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we should meditate on Radharani in this way. We should meditate on Her mercy and her magnanimity and her compassion. And her mood. Her mood, is \"let Me bring others forward to please Krsna.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tgopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah<br />\n\t(Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 13.80)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"I identify Myself only as the servant of the servant of the servant of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, the maintainer of the gopis.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the proper mood. To bring others forward. And Radharani gets a pleasure ten million times greater by bringing others forward in their relationship with Krsna. This is how we can get Radharani's attention. It's not so cheap. It's not that you can just raise your hands and get attention. If you want to get Her attention, then understand Her mood. \"Let others go forward. Let me stay behind. Let me bring them forward. Let me please Her and let me stay even farther behind. She knows. She will recognize.\" We will get Her mercy.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this way, if we remember this on this auspicious day, and remember Her magnanimity and compassion and Her mercy, then even an unqualified fool can remember something about Radharani. OK? It's 11:00. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n</p>\n",

I had never been there before and a few devotees had suggested that it was a quiet and beautiful place to visit. So during a long walk with Govinda Maharaja on the day before, when I proposed the idea to see Charyn Canyon together, he agreed that a visit there would be a nice opportunity to spend another day together. Taking a large picnic basket along with us, about seven of us set out in two vehicles early the next morning for Charyn Canyon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough it was about 38 degrees Centigrade when we arrived at the canyon, somehow I was not as bothered by the heat as I expected I would be. We immediately drove to the base of the canyon, walked around for a short while, and then sat along the river to take some simple prasadam of boiled potatoes, baked potatoes, fresh tomatoes and cucumber, and, of course, a few slices of pizza from Govinda's restaurant. There was a very nice breeze along the banks of the swift-flowing river which also helped to minimize the disturbance from the heat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore honoring prasadam, while sitting and chanting, I noticed a young man lying along the banks of the river. Just behind him was a bicycle, loaded with side-packs and all kinds of paraphernalia. I got the impression that he was a world-traveler of sorts and I also had the impression that he wasn't from Kazakhstan. By the time Govinda Maharaja arrived for prasada, after taking some pictures of the lower part of the canyon, the young man was standing up, wading along the shallow banks of the river. Govinda Maharaja also noticed him as I did, so he immediately took the opportunity to send Kisori Mohan to invite him for lunch.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs I suspected, it turned out that his name was William, and he had been bicycling all the way from England. He was on his way to China and Tibet, and decided to go through Kazakhstan along the way. The three of us spoke for awhile, but Govinda Maharaja took a strong initiative to befriend him and to introduce him, in a very personal way, to some of the basic teachings of Krsna consciousness. Not wanting to interfere with Maharaja's expert approach to befriending this young man, I gradually distanced myself from the conversation and let Govinda Maharaja give him as much personal attention as he could give him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince the conversation went on for quite some time, I decided to pull out a camera I brought along with me. I had the camera in my bag since my parikrama in Mayapura last November, but I never used it. As it turned out, Thakur Saranga dasa, a professional photographer who regularly submits his works to \"National Geographic\" came along with us in Mayapura, so there was no need for me to take the pictures I wanted back then. And since I'm generally not one for taking pictures, the camera was just never used. Still, I thought that Cheryn Canyon would as good a place as any to get a few shots of a nice place and to share them. So, those who are interested, can find my first (and possibly, last) photos in the photos section here on the site.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tDear Srila Prabhupada,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlease accept my prostrated obeisances in the dust of your lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn this auspicious day of your Vyasa Puja, I would like to express my ever-increasing gratitude to you for reminding me, again and again, of your unparalleled method for distributing pure devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI had no qualification to closely observe the way you brought conditioned souls to Krishna's lotus feet during the years you were physically with us. I heard you lecture, watched you being interviewed by unmindful reporters, walked behind you, closely observing how your lotus feet barely touched the ground, witnessed your pure devotion, received your momentary glance, and savored every precious moment my eyes and ears were in contact with your divine form and compassionate voice. But, it was not Krishna's will for me to be in close proximity to you for very long.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Caitanya, Himself, declared, 'sadhu-sanga', ‘sadhu-sanga' -- sarva-sastre kaya<br />\r\n\tlava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya, \"The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can attain all success.\" Unfortunately, I also did not have the adhikara to achieve the perfection your darshan can bestow within \"even a moment.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, by your divine grace, both by hearing about you and by watching the effect your method for preaching continues to have upon others, I am able to catch an occasional glimpse of your mystical potencies for attracting conditioned souls to Krishna's lotus feet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLately, I have been reading a lot about your preaching pastimes, revealed by those who witnessed them more closely than I did. Absorbing myself in thoughts of ISKCON's early days, I became captivated by the way you introduced your first Western followers to Krishna's lotus feet. The first impressions of those who were attracted to you, and subsequently, to those who accepted you as their supreme guide, was that you were genuine. A common idiom used for this, is that, you were, \"for real\" or, that you \"walked your talk.\" In other words, you were a living example of everything you spoke about to everyone you met. Even before being able to grasp the full meaning of the words&nbsp; \"guru\", \"disciple\", or what to speak of—\"initiation\", they were already assisting you, serving you, and ready to sacrifice for you, mainly because you were so genuine.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese novices to the practices of \"bhakti\" had no other frame of reference for accepting you as their spiritual master. There was no one nearby to endorse you. They had not been exposed to the authorized scriptural references from which they could draw a conclusion about your authenticity. It seemed that they were, in no way, prepared for, or even expecting, what was about to happen to them. You simply appeared before them on your own merit and because Krishna and the whole disciplic succession was behind you (though unseen to their eyes), your instructions were heard, they surrendered to you, and you gave them Krishna and nothing but service to Krishna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout your sterling example, I've been left to wonder how \"hippies\", or those who were known for having rejected all forms of authority, could have come to the point of surrendering themselves to you, the pure representative of the highest authority. But this was your method for preaching, and this method was reinforced again and again, not only by your example, but in your own words:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"I am very glad to note that you are seeing that the devotees are maintaining the devotional practices. This is the secret to success. Therefore I am stressing it. And, if you also stress it and show yourself as an ideal Vaisnava, then you are my representative in fullness. We are not after titles and designations. Lord Caitanya made it a principle that we must teach by personal example. This is what I have tried to do. So if all of you my disciples do this, then the future of our movement will be glorious.\" (SPL to Hrdayananda dasa Goswami, 31st October, 1974)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"The qualities of a brahman as mentioned in BG chapter 18: sama dama tapasocam [Bg. 18.42]. You must teach these qualities. These qualities will naturally come out, if you just give the process purely. The information is there in my books so if you strictly adhere to them then your program of teaching will be successful. First of all you must teach by your personal example. This is the principle of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu (apani acari bhakti pracaram). So you yourself must chant 16 rounds and follow the regulative principles and automatically they will do as you are doing. Then they will become strong Vaisnavas.\" (Letter to: Hiranyagarbha&nbsp; --&nbsp; Vrindaban 19 August, 1974)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDear Srila Prabhupada, thank you again and again, for constantly reminding me that without your example, I would have no strength at all for traversing the path you have laid out before me. How can I ever forget what I must do to please you when so many of your \"representatives in fullness\" are here to remind me of you?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately, I am still very weak. I need to be reminded again and again, that without preaching in this way, my service to you will never be a fit offering to you. It is for this reason, that I must also thank you, again and again, for giving me the association of godbrothers who always remind me of you by showing me the secret to their success in being able to please you. It is they, who have captured the essence of everything you came to give us, and it is through them, that I am still witnessing the effects of your preaching methods today, almost fifty years since you first placed your lotus feet on Western soil.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn this most auspicious day of your divine appearance in this world, I prostrate myself to your lotus feet, again and again, and beg you to please teach me the ways of pure devotional service. Please give me the strength to accept all you have to offer me, and please always keep me in the association of those who know nothing but service to your divine lotus feet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYour eternal servant,<br />\r\n\tNiranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n",

All glories to Your Divine Grace.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn this auspicious day of your Vyasa Puja, I would like to express my ever-increasing gratitude to you for reminding me, again and again, of your unparalleled method for distributing pure devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI had no qualification to closely observe the way you brought conditioned souls to Krishna's lotus feet during the years you were physically with us. I heard you lecture, watched you being interviewed by unmindful reporters, walked behind you, closely observing how your lotus feet barely touched the ground, witnessed your pure devotion, received your momentary glance, and savored every precious moment my eyes and ears were in contact with your divine form and compassionate voice. But, it was not Krishna's will for me to be in close proximity to you for very long.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Caitanya, Himself, declared, 'sadhu-sanga', ‘sadhu-sanga' -- sarva-sastre kaya<br />\n\tlava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya, \"The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can attain all success.\" Unfortunately, I also did not have the adhikara to achieve the perfection your darshan can bestow within \"even a moment.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, by your divine grace, both by hearing about you and by watching the effect your method for preaching continues to have upon others, I am able to catch an occasional glimpse of your mystical potencies for attracting conditioned souls to Krishna's lotus feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLately, I have been reading a lot about your preaching pastimes, revealed by those who witnessed them more closely than I did. Absorbing myself in thoughts of ISKCON's early days, I became captivated by the way you introduced your first Western followers to Krishna's lotus feet. The first impressions of those who were attracted to you, and subsequently, to those who accepted you as their supreme guide, was that you were genuine. A common idiom used for this, is that, you were, \"for real\" or, that you \"walked your talk.\" In other words, you were a living example of everything you spoke about to everyone you met. Even before being able to grasp the full meaning of the words  \"guru\", \"disciple\", or what to speak of—\"initiation\", they were already assisting you, serving you, and ready to sacrifice for you, mainly because you were so genuine.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese novices to the practices of \"bhakti\" had no other frame of reference for accepting you as their spiritual master. There was no one nearby to endorse you. They had not been exposed to the authorized scriptural references from which they could draw a conclusion about your authenticity. It seemed that they were, in no way, prepared for, or even expecting, what was about to happen to them. You simply appeared before them on your own merit and because Krishna and the whole disciplic succession was behind you (though unseen to their eyes), your instructions were heard, they surrendered to you, and you gave them Krishna and nothing but service to Krishna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWithout your sterling example, I've been left to wonder how \"hippies\", or those who were known for having rejected all forms of authority, could have come to the point of surrendering themselves to you, the pure representative of the highest authority. But this was your method for preaching, and this method was reinforced again and again, not only by your example, but in your own words:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"I am very glad to note that you are seeing that the devotees are maintaining the devotional practices. This is the secret to success. Therefore I am stressing it. And, if you also stress it and show yourself as an ideal Vaisnava, then you are my representative in fullness. We are not after titles and designations. Lord Caitanya made it a principle that we must teach by personal example. This is what I have tried to do. So if all of you my disciples do this, then the future of our movement will be glorious.\" (SPL to Hrdayananda dasa Goswami, 31st October, 1974)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"The qualities of a brahman as mentioned in BG chapter 18: sama dama tapasocam [Bg. 18.42]. You must teach these qualities. These qualities will naturally come out, if you just give the process purely. The information is there in my books so if you strictly adhere to them then your program of teaching will be successful. First of all you must teach by your personal example. This is the principle of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu (apani acari bhakti pracaram). So you yourself must chant 16 rounds and follow the regulative principles and automatically they will do as you are doing. Then they will become strong Vaisnavas.\" (Letter to: Hiranyagarbha  --  Vrindaban 19 August, 1974)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDear Srila Prabhupada, thank you again and again, for constantly reminding me that without your example, I would have no strength at all for traversing the path you have laid out before me. How can I ever forget what I must do to please you when so many of your \"representatives in fullness\" are here to remind me of you?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, I am still very weak.

It's important to understand that the main reason for posting this conversation is because I was told that many devotees have not been aware that there is a GBC resolution which states that a spiritual master in ISKCON can accept a Vyasa Puja arranged by his disciples no more than on one day in a year. This resolution has existed since 1999, and is as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"ISKCON members shall celebrate Srila Prabhupada’s Vyasa-puja ceremony as the preeminent Vyasa-puja ceremony in ISKCON. All ISKCON members are requested to write an annual Vyasa-puja offering to Srila Prabhupada. Vyasa-puja for ISKCON gurus other than Srila Prabhupada should only be observed on one day a year. This celebration may be held in the temple room. ISKCON members conducting Vyasa-puja ceremonies for ISKCON siksa and diksa gurus shall observe them in a modest way, significantly less elaborate in duration and cost than Srila Prabhupada’s Vyasa-puja. In general, devotees shall observe these Vyasa-puja celebrations in their own locales. In ISKCON, only Srila Prabhupada’s Vyasa-puja book shall be published.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t\"Guideline: Since transmitting transcendental knowledge is the primary responsibility of every siksa and diksa guru, and since annual Vyasa-puja celebrations have generally been attended by disciples from remote regions to fulfill their need for siksa from their diksa or siksa guru, the regional leaders should therefore compensate for this need by both organizing and facilitating annual festivals (at least three days) with organized seminars and/or lectures given by diksa and siksa gurus whose disciples reside in that region.\" [End of resolution]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt seems that the fact that this resolution was not known has led to a serious misunderstanding as to why I've accepted invitations for Vyasa Puja primarily in Ukraine every year and have not considered having it elsewhere for the benefit of those who could not attend in Ukraine. It is my hope that the recording of this conversation may clear up these misunderstandings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIsani devi dasi is aware that the recording is being posted. It is important to note, however, that from the sound of our voices, especially mine, it may appear that a heated discussion was taking place during the first part of our conversation. It's true, I was speaking loudly and quite assertively to Isani devi dasi. However, it is also true that I was smiling at her and at the two other devotees (Doyal Caitanya dasa and Aniruddha dasa, my translator) during all of that time. I knew that there was a very simple explanation to the whole misperception, although initially she was not so convinced of this. I therefore spoke assertively in an attempt to make Isani devi dasi offer the least resistance possible so that she could give her full attention to all that I had to say. By Krsna's grace, it did seem to work.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tObviously the conversation was not the typical transmission of knowledge between a guru and his disciple. But, by Krsna's grace, it did seem to clear all of her doubts.

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a Srimad Bhagavatam lecture (SB 4.22.19) &nbsp;given on May 17, 2014 during the Ukrainian Counselor Retreat.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrimad Bhagavatam 4.22.19\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsangamah khalu sadhunam<br />\r\n\tubhayesam ca sammatah<br />\r\n\tyat-sambhasana-samprasnah<br />\r\n\tsarvesam vitanoti sam\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\tWhen there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers become conclusive to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPURPORT<br />\r\n\tHearing discussions among the devotees is the only means to receive the powerful message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For instance, Bhagavad-gita has been well known all over the world for a very long time, especially in the Western world, but because the subject matter was not discussed by devotees, there was no effect. Not a single person in the West became Krsna conscious before the Krsna consciousness movement was founded. But when the same Bhagavad-gita was presented as it is through the disciplic succession, the effect of spiritual realization was immediately manifested.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSanat-kumara, one of the Kumaras, informed Prthu Maharaja that his meeting with the Kumaras benefited not only Maharaja Prthu but the Kumaras as well. When Narada Muni questioned Lord Brahma about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Brahma thanked Narada Muni for giving him a chance to speak about the Supreme Lord. Therefore questions put by a saintly person to another saintly person about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about the ultimate goal of life surcharge everything spiritually. Whoever takes advantage of such discussions is benefited both in this life and in the next.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe word ubhayesam can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the materialist and the transcendentalist. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and transcendentalist are benefited. The materialist is benefited by association with devotees because his life then becomes regulated so that his chance of becoming a devotee or making the present life successful for understanding the real position of the living entity is increased. When one takes advantage of this opportunity, he is assured of a human form of life in the next birth, or he may be liberated completely and go back home, back to Godhead. The conclusion is that if one participates in a discussion of devotees, he is both materially and spiritually benefited. The speaker and the audience are both benefited, and the karmis and jnanis are benefited. The discussion of spiritual matters amongst devotees is beneficial for everyone, without exception. Consequently the Kumaras admitted that not only was the King benefited by such a meeting, but the Kumaras were as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis verse is part of the conversation between Sanat-kumara and Prithu Maharaja. The Four Kumaras appeared before Prithu Maharaja and Prithu Maharaja, immediately recognizing their identities, took advantage of their presence by inquiring from them. He said, \"There's no need to ask about your good and bad fortune because you're always absorbed in bliss. Therefore I'm going to take advantage of your presence and ask you about how I can attain good fortune.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrithu Maharaja had inquired from the sages, \"Persons entangled in this dangerous material existence because of their previous actions, could such persons, whose only aim is sense gratification, be blessed with good fortune?\" That was his question… a very relevant question. He's taking the humble position of a person entangled in a web of sense gratification by asking, \"How can I attain any good fortune in his life?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSanat-kumara replied, \"Thank you\", and then says, \"I've been very nicely questioned by you. Such questions are beneficial for all living entities especially because they are asked by you, because you're always thinking of everyone else's welfare. Although you know everything you ask such questions because that is the behavior of saintly persons.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe see this exchange in many places of the Bhagavatam where the Bhagavatam speakers express their gratitude to the audience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tmunayah sadhu prsto 'ham<br />\r\n\tbhavadbhir loka-mangalam<br />\r\n\tyat krtah krsna-samprasno<br />\r\n\tyenatma suprasidati\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\tO sages, I have been justly questioned by you. Your questions are worthy because they relate to Lord Krsna and so are of relevance to the world's welfare. Only questions of this sort are capable of completely satisfying the self. (SB 1.2.5)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuta Goswami thanked his audience for asking relevant questions in the same way as Sanat-kumara is thanking Prithu Maharaja. \"Thank you for asking how to obtain good fortune. And although you say that you don't have to inquire about my good fortune because you see that our status is always auspicious, I can see that not only is my status auspicious, but your status is auspicious too because you are interested in hearing such topics.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore today's verse explains the essence of Sanat-kumara's answer to Prithu Maharaja. \"When there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers, become conclusive to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the sages of Naimasaranya gathered to perform a sacrifice, they were performing a sacrifice for the benefit of the entire world. What was their sacrifice?...hearing Srimad Bhagavatam. It's not that they sat in front a sacrificial fire, poured ghee into the fire and then expected that that was sufficient to benefit all humanity. They performed the ultimate sacrifice for this age. They gathered to hear, to discuss, and to glorify the topics related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that's why Suta Goswami was so pleased by their questions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe sages of Naimasaranya began the sacrifice by asking, \"What is the supreme occupation for all mankind? In other words, \"What dharma should all living beings engage in? The answer was the famous verse:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsa vai pumsam paro dharmo<br />\r\n\tyato bhaktir adhoksaje<br />\r\n\tahaituky apratihata<br />\r\n\tyayatma suprasidati\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\tThe supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self. (SB 1.2.6)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo the only solution for satisfying the hankering, or the needs, of the eternal soul is to establish his connection with the Supreme.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada explains in a Bhagavad-gita commentary that the living entities in the material world suffer due to want of an ultimate goal in life. Without establishing an ultimate goal, people will continue to aspire for the fulfillment of so many lesser goals and will still not feel sheltered upon receiving the fruits of their efforts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, the only way the self can be perfectly sheltered and satisfied is by being fully engaged in devotional service to the Lord. And what is the means for obtaining devotional service? If devotional service is the ultimate goal, is the only activity which can satisfy the hankering soul, then a person should become eager to know how to obtain it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the conversation between Lord Caitanya and Ramananda Raya, Ramananda Raya answers this question:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tkrsna-bhakti-rasa-bhavita matih<br />\r\n\tkriyatam yadi kuto 'pi labhyate<br />\r\n\ttatra laulyam api mulyam ekalam<br />\r\n\tjanma-koti-sukrtair na labhyate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\t\"‘Pure devotional service in Krsna consciousness cannot be had even by pious activity in hundreds and thousands of lives. It can be attained only by paying one price -- that is, intense greed to obtain it. If it is available somewhere, one must purchase it without delay.'\" (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 8.70)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne has to develop a greed to have it. There is no other way to obtain it. If one doesn't become greedy to have it, it's not going to just immediatley fall from the sky and immediately transform our hearts. Therefore when one obtains the association of a devotee of the Lord, that association is called divine grace. That's why we refer to Srila Prabhupada as \"His Divine Grace.\" By His Divine Grace, even a person who previously had no inclination for devotional service can immediately develop an attraction to obtain it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat desire is awakened in the heart. It's already there, but it needs to be awakened.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnitya-siddha krsna-prema ‘sadhya' kabhu naya<br />\r\n\tsravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\t\"Pure love for Krsna is eternally established in the hearts of the living entities. It is not something to be gained from another source. When the heart is purified by hearing and chanting, this love naturally awakens. (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 22.107)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce it's awakened, what does one have to do? Once it's awakened, one has to make some effort. It's not only by the effort of somebody else.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor example, if you have a very important engagement on a particular day, and somebody comes and wakes you up, \"It's time to get up.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Oh, I'm so tired.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd they come back again, \"Prabhu it's time to get up.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Oh I'm just so tired, so tired.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven modern society takes all this into consideration. Now all alarm clocks always have a \"snooze\" button. Isn't it? Every morning, they can count how many times they hit the snooze button. \"Five more minutes. I can get five more minutes.\" Then after five minutes passes, they think, \"Well I can get five more. Why not?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo either somebody comes and shakes you every five minutes or your alarm goes off every five minutes, but you have an important event that day. Once somebody wakes you up, you have to make the effort to stay awake. Whether it's your alarm clock or somebody else coming and waking you, you still have to make the effort, \"OK. I'm going to get up, and I'm going to take a cold shower. And then I'm going to stick my hand in my bead bad and stay awake.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIsn't it? The first thing we do when we wake up in the morning is offer our obeisances to our spiritual master. Then we have to make the effort to stay awake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Caitanya is calling, \"Jiv Jago, Jiva Jago. Wake up sleeping souls. How long are you going to sleep on the lap of the witch called Maya.\" So Lord Caitanya is making the call to everybody, \"Wake up!\" He's making the first call. \"OK. Time to wake up.\" But are we going to expect him to keep on coming back to say, \"Wake up. Wake up\"… again and again and again. He's got better things to offer you than to tell you to wake up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe have to make the effort to stay awake and therefore that effort is our responsibility. How to stay awake. So by the mercy of \"His Divine Grace\", he wakes up the sleeping soul. He tells us that we are the eternal servants of Krsna. Our constitutional nature is to render pure, loving, unmotivated, devotional service to Him. And then he has so many more things to tell us after we're awake… about how to stay awake. How to realize our actual spiritual identity. That realization awakens in those who are eager to obtain it. We have to make the effort.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tatah sri-krsna-namadi<br />\r\n\tna bhaved grahyam indriyaih<br />\r\n\tsevonmukhe hi jihvadau<br />\r\n\tsvayam eva sphuraty adah\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\t\"‘Therefore material senses cannot appreciate Krsna's holy name, form, qualities and pastimes. When a conditioned soul is awakened to Krsna consciousness and renders service by using his tongue to chant the Lord's holy name and taste the remnants of the Lord's food, the tongue is purified, and one gradually comes to understand who Krsna really is.' (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 17.136)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna can only be understood by spiritual senses which become purified, beginning with the tongue. When the tongue is used for discussing transcendental topics about the Lord, then either by speaking about Krsna or by inquiring about Krsna, we can then take responsibility. We might say, \"I'm not Krsna conscious.\" But then you can inquire about Krsna. That's exactly what is happening right here in this exchange between Prithu Maharaja and Sanat-kumara.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrithu Maharaja took the position of being very fallen and engrossed in sense&nbsp; gratification and he said, \"This is a very dangerous material existence because I'm entangled because of my previous actions in this material existence. How can any person who is so entangled in sense gratification have any good fortune in life? How can they be blessed with good fortune?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo he took the position of asking, although he could have spoken. All realization was there but he took the position of asking. And Sanat-kumara says, \"Oh thank you so much. You are helping me. I'll benefit from this opportunity. You're engaging me in devotional service.\" He was so grateful. \"You're so merciful that you are giving me an opportunity to speak about transcendental topics. I know I can't speak about anything else because you're not interested in hearing anything else. I'm so grateful. I know I won't get away with talking about Maya to you because you don't want to hear anything about Maya. You are so kind. For my benefit you've asked this question. Thank you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore both the speaker and the hearer, they benefit because the only topic is transcendental subject matter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are many things that I wanted to speak about this morning but we have a schedule to follow today. I want to end at the appropriate time, at 9:00. I was going to read this later, but I'll read it now because I want to make sure it's read. It's a very wonderful verse from the fifth canto of the Bhagavatam. I really like it. It's spoken by Jada Bharata to Maharaja Rahugana.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Who are the pure devotees mentioned here? In an assembly of pure devotees, there is no question of discussing material subjects like politics and sociology. In an assembly of pure devotees, there is discussion only of the qualities, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is praised and worshiped with full attention. In the association of pure devotees, by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vasudeva.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPURPORT<br />\r\n\tThe symptoms of pure devotees are described in this verse. The pure devotee is never interested in material topics. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has strictly prohibited His devotees to talk about worldly matters. Gramya-varta na kahibe: [Cc. Antya 6.236] one should not indulge in talking unnecessarily about news of the material world. One should not waste time in this way. This is a very important feature in the life of a devotee. A devotee has no other ambition than to serve Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Krsna consciousness movement was started to engage people twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord and in His glorification. The students in this institution engage in the cultivation of Krsna consciousness from five in the morning to ten at night. They actually have no opportunity to waste their time unnecessarily by discussing politics, sociology and current events. These will go their own way. A devotee is concerned only with serving Krsna positively and seriously. [End of purport] (SB 5.12.13)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese will go their own way! In other words, they will go on anyways and it will be their own way. Of course, someone might say, \"Well this verse is speaking about an assembly of pure devotees, but I'm not a pure devotee.\" But we already established that the only real solution to the problems of life is to become purified. Any effort we make to try to counteract one fruitive activity by another fruitive activity is going to entangle us further. That's exactly what material life is. Material life is a constant endeavor to counteract reactions to past sinful life. And that's why Prithu Maharaja said, \"I'm a sense gratifier and my current situation is simply the result of my previous activities.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe didn't say, \"How do I counteract the results of my previous activities?\" That's how materialists think. How to avoid suffering to obtain happiness and to mitigate distress. Prahlada Maharaja explains:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"In this material world, every materialist desires to achieve happiness and diminish his distress, and therefore he acts accordingly. Actually, however, one is happy as long as one does not endeavor for happiness; as soon as one begins his activities for happiness, his conditions of distress begin. (SB 7.7.42)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn intelligent person should try to stop the cycle. Not \"How do I counteract my past sinful reactions so that I can be [so-called] happy now.\" This happiness is temporary. Therefore Lord Rsabhadeva instructed his sons, instead one should look for \"brahma saukhyam\", real happiness, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn intelligent person looks for the real solution. He becomes greedy for attaining the opportuinty to hear about Krsna, the only solution. Therefore when devotees get together, they utilize their time to its full potential. They don't waste time discussing politics, sociology and current events. These will go their own way!! They are going to go their own way. Why should we waste time discussing these things? No solution comes by discussing these things! They will still go their own way. Better I become Krsna conscious. Better I get together to discuss topics related to Krsna. It's in my hands. It's my responsibility to utilize my life wisely. In other words, it's my responsibilitiy to stay awake!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCertainly by \"divine grace\" somebody will come and tell us to wake up. Don't stay sleeping in the lap of the witch called Maya. But how to stay awake? The way to stay awake is to utilize this human life to it's full potential… and the best opportunity for this is in the association of devotees. A devotee will be eager to ask, \"Please, can you tell me something Krsna conscious?\" And we should say, \"Thank you. You saved me. My tendency would have been to talk nonsense but you saved me by asking the right question.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen when devotees become inspired in this way, what is the result? Prabhupada explains that in the commentary today. He says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"The word ubhayesam can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the materialist and the transcendentalist. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and transcendentalist are benefited.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, when devotees become inspired by topics about the Supreme Lord, then anybody who comes in contact with such discussions can also obtain divine grace. Devotees can be carriers of divine grace. Materialists become devotees by association with such devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBoth the devotees are benefitted and the materialists are benefitted. Or as it is stated in verse that we just read from the fifth canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, \"Even the impersonalists become devotees. The verse states that, \"…by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vasudeva.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo therefore when the sages asked their question to Suta Goswami, \"What is the supreme sacrifice, or highest activity, meant to benefit all humanity?\", the sages then performed that sacrifice by sitting and hearing the topics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who comes in contact with such discussions are reminded of the need to wake up. Once awake, they then become eager to stay awake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat's why it's so important for devotees to regularly come together to discuss transcendental topics. When devotees come together, sometimes they think, \"What are we going to do with each other? Should we play football? That will keep us all engaged. Good exercise. What else? There must be other things that we can think of to keep us busy so that we don't fall into maya.\"[Devotees laugh]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt's so clear. Well someone may say, \"Well I don't have any taste for that. Well then Bhagavatam states that one should seek out the association of devotees who will give you some taste.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi<br />\r\n\tsarva-sanga-vivarjitah<br />\r\n\tsangas tesv atha te prarthyah<br />\r\n\tsanga-dosa-hara hi te\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\tO My mother, O virtuous lady, these are the qualities of great devotees who are free from all attachment. You must seek attachment to such holy men, for this counteracts the pernicious effects of material attachment. (SB 3.25.24)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe pernicious effects of material attachments will be counteracted and a natural taste will awaken. But even if I still don't have taste, Krsna says in the Bhagavad-gita, that a sages should act for his own purification.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"The yogis, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification.\" (Bg 5.11)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn intelligent person will therefore think, \"Yes. Even though I don't have a taste, because it's pleasing to Krsna and it's pleasing to the Vaisnavas, I'll do it for my own purification.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya<br />\r\n\tvasudeva-katha-rucih<br />\r\n\tsyan mahat-sevaya viprah<br />\r\n\tpunya-tirtha-nisevanat\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\tO twice-born sages, by serving those devotees who are completely freed from all vice, great service is done. By such service, one gains affinity for hearing the messages of Vasudeva. (SB 1.2.16)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd what do devotees ask those who serve them to do? What did Prabhupada ask his tender, neophyte followers to do when they came and heard from him in 26 Second Avenue? He took them out and introduced them to giving the holy name to others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the \"Prabhupada Lilamrita\" there is a wonderful description of the first harinama the devotees went on without Prabhupada. The devotees were just so ecstatic because they were so eager to go back and tell Prabhupada what they did. They couldn't wait. They burst into his room, \"Prabhupada. We went out and we chanted today!\" And Prabhupada was so pleased. Oh yes. Now you are understanding. Now you understand what pleases me. This makes me very happy. You have understood my message. Thank you so much.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is how to serve the devotees. Even if we don't have taste. We do it for our own purification because by serving them, we develop some taste. We benefit and anyone who comes in contact with us benefits. We don't water down. We give the essence because it is the essence which purifies the heart, puts us on the path of pure devotional service and keeps us on the path. It keeps us awake, so that we won't fall back asleep again and forget what the purpose is of this life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Sanat-kumara is saying, \"Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to speak and then he said, \"This is the solution.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"When there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers become conclusive to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI can't take questions. I know you might have some. I know you must have. But thank you for all of your questions. I'm thanking you even before you ask them. But for those of you who are taking part in the retreat, you know that I left time this afternoon for questions and answers. You can ask them then.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada ki jaya.\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"safe_value": "<p>\n\tThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a Srimad Bhagavatam lecture (SB 4.22.19)  given on May 17, 2014 during the Ukrainian Counselor Retreat. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrimad Bhagavatam 4.22.19\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsangamah khalu sadhunam<br />\n\tubhayesam ca sammatah<br />\n\tyat-sambhasana-samprasnah<br />\n\tsarvesam vitanoti sam\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\n\tWhen there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers become conclusive to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPURPORT<br />\n\tHearing discussions among the devotees is the only means to receive the powerful message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For instance, Bhagavad-gita has been well known all over the world for a very long time, especially in the Western world, but because the subject matter was not discussed by devotees, there was no effect. Not a single person in the West became Krsna conscious before the Krsna consciousness movement was founded. But when the same Bhagavad-gita was presented as it is through the disciplic succession, the effect of spiritual realization was immediately manifested.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSanat-kumara, one of the Kumaras, informed Prthu Maharaja that his meeting with the Kumaras benefited not only Maharaja Prthu but the Kumaras as well. When Narada Muni questioned Lord Brahma about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Brahma thanked Narada Muni for giving him a chance to speak about the Supreme Lord. Therefore questions put by a saintly person to another saintly person about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about the ultimate goal of life surcharge everything spiritually. Whoever takes advantage of such discussions is benefited both in this life and in the next.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe word ubhayesam can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the materialist and the transcendentalist. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and transcendentalist are benefited. The materialist is benefited by association with devotees because his life then becomes regulated so that his chance of becoming a devotee or making the present life successful for understanding the real position of the living entity is increased. When one takes advantage of this opportunity, he is assured of a human form of life in the next birth, or he may be liberated completely and go back home, back to Godhead. The conclusion is that if one participates in a discussion of devotees, he is both materially and spiritually benefited. The speaker and the audience are both benefited, and the karmis and jnanis are benefited. The discussion of spiritual matters amongst devotees is beneficial for everyone, without exception. Consequently the Kumaras admitted that not only was the King benefited by such a meeting, but the Kumaras were as well.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis verse is part of the conversation between Sanat-kumara and Prithu Maharaja. The Four Kumaras appeared before Prithu Maharaja and Prithu Maharaja, immediately recognizing their identities, took advantage of their presence by inquiring from them. He said, \"There's no need to ask about your good and bad fortune because you're always absorbed in bliss. Therefore I'm going to take advantage of your presence and ask you about how I can attain good fortune.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrithu Maharaja had inquired from the sages, \"Persons entangled in this dangerous material existence because of their previous actions, could such persons, whose only aim is sense gratification, be blessed with good fortune?\" That was his question… a very relevant question. He's taking the humble position of a person entangled in a web of sense gratification by asking, \"How can I attain any good fortune in his life?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSanat-kumara replied, \"Thank you\", and then says, \"I've been very nicely questioned by you. Such questions are beneficial for all living entities especially because they are asked by you, because you're always thinking of everyone else's welfare. Although you know everything you ask such questions because that is the behavior of saintly persons.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe see this exchange in many places of the Bhagavatam where the Bhagavatam speakers express their gratitude to the audience.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tmunayah sadhu prsto 'ham<br />\n\tbhavadbhir loka-mangalam<br />\n\tyat krtah krsna-samprasno<br />\n\tyenatma suprasidati\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\n\tO sages, I have been justly questioned by you. Your questions are worthy because they relate to Lord Krsna and so are of relevance to the world's welfare. Only questions of this sort are capable of completely satisfying the self. (SB 1.2.5)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSuta Goswami thanked his audience for asking relevant questions in the same way as Sanat-kumara is thanking Prithu Maharaja. \"Thank you for asking how to obtain good fortune. And although you say that you don't have to inquire about my good fortune because you see that our status is always auspicious, I can see that not only is my status auspicious, but your status is auspicious too because you are interested in hearing such topics.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore today's verse explains the essence of Sanat-kumara's answer to Prithu Maharaja. \"When there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers, become conclusive to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the sages of Naimasaranya gathered to perform a sacrifice, they were performing a sacrifice for the benefit of the entire world. What was their sacrifice?...hearing Srimad Bhagavatam. It's not that they sat in front a sacrificial fire, poured ghee into the fire and then expected that that was sufficient to benefit all humanity. They performed the ultimate sacrifice for this age. They gathered to hear, to discuss, and to glorify the topics related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that's why Suta Goswami was so pleased by their questions.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe sages of Naimasaranya began the sacrifice by asking, \"What is the supreme occupation for all mankind? In other words, \"What dharma should all living beings engage in? The answer was the famous verse:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsa vai pumsam paro dharmo<br />\n\tyato bhaktir adhoksaje<br />\n\tahaituky apratihata<br />\n\tyayatma suprasidati\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\n\tThe supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self. (SB 1.2.6)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the only solution for satisfying the hankering, or the needs, of the eternal soul is to establish his connection with the Supreme.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada explains in a Bhagavad-gita commentary that the living entities in the material world suffer due to want of an ultimate goal in life. Without establishing an ultimate goal, people will continue to aspire for the fulfillment of so many lesser goals and will still not feel sheltered upon receiving the fruits of their efforts.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, the only way the self can be perfectly sheltered and satisfied is by being fully engaged in devotional service to the Lord. And what is the means for obtaining devotional service? If devotional service is the ultimate goal, is the only activity which can satisfy the hankering soul, then a person should become eager to know how to obtain it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the conversation between Lord Caitanya and Ramananda Raya, Ramananda Raya answers this question:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tkrsna-bhakti-rasa-bhavita matih<br />\n\tkriyatam yadi kuto 'pi labhyate<br />\n\ttatra laulyam api mulyam ekalam<br />\n\tjanma-koti-sukrtair na labhyate\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\n\t\"‘Pure devotional service in Krsna consciousness cannot be had even by pious activity in hundreds and thousands of lives. It can be attained only by paying one price -- that is, intense greed to obtain it. If it is available somewhere, one must purchase it without delay.'\" (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 8.70)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne has to develop a greed to have it. There is no other way to obtain it. If one doesn't become greedy to have it, it's not going to just immediatley fall from the sky and immediately transform our hearts. Therefore when one obtains the association of a devotee of the Lord, that association is called divine grace. That's why we refer to Srila Prabhupada as \"His Divine Grace.\" By His Divine Grace, even a person who previously had no inclination for devotional service can immediately develop an attraction to obtain it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat desire is awakened in the heart. It's already there, but it needs to be awakened.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tnitya-siddha krsna-prema ‘sadhya' kabhu naya<br />\n\tsravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\n\t\"Pure love for Krsna is eternally established in the hearts of the living entities. It is not something to be gained from another source. When the heart is purified by hearing and chanting, this love naturally awakens. (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 22.107)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce it's awakened, what does one have to do? Once it's awakened, one has to make some effort. It's not only by the effort of somebody else.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, if you have a very important engagement on a particular day, and somebody comes and wakes you up, \"It's time to get up.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Oh, I'm so tired.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd they come back again, \"Prabhu it's time to get up.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Oh I'm just so tired, so tired.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEven modern society takes all this into consideration. Now all alarm clocks always have a \"snooze\" button. Isn't it? Every morning, they can count how many times they hit the snooze button. \"Five more minutes. I can get five more minutes.\" Then after five minutes passes, they think, \"Well I can get five more. Why not?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo either somebody comes and shakes you every five minutes or your alarm goes off every five minutes, but you have an important event that day. Once somebody wakes you up, you have to make the effort to stay awake. Whether it's your alarm clock or somebody else coming and waking you, you still have to make the effort, \"OK. I'm going to get up, and I'm going to take a cold shower. And then I'm going to stick my hand in my bead bad and stay awake.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIsn't it? The first thing we do when we wake up in the morning is offer our obeisances to our spiritual master. Then we have to make the effort to stay awake.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Caitanya is calling, \"Jiv Jago, Jiva Jago. Wake up sleeping souls. How long are you going to sleep on the lap of the witch called Maya.\" So Lord Caitanya is making the call to everybody, \"Wake up!\" He's making the first call. \"OK. Time to wake up.\" But are we going to expect him to keep on coming back to say, \"Wake up. Wake up\"… again and again and again. He's got better things to offer you than to tell you to wake up.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have to make the effort to stay awake and therefore that effort is our responsibility. How to stay awake. So by the mercy of \"His Divine Grace\", he wakes up the sleeping soul. He tells us that we are the eternal servants of Krsna. Our constitutional nature is to render pure, loving, unmotivated, devotional service to Him. And then he has so many more things to tell us after we're awake… about how to stay awake. How to realize our actual spiritual identity. That realization awakens in those who are eager to obtain it. We have to make the effort.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tatah sri-krsna-namadi<br />\n\tna bhaved grahyam indriyaih<br />\n\tsevonmukhe hi jihvadau<br />\n\tsvayam eva sphuraty adah\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\n\t\"‘Therefore material senses cannot appreciate Krsna's holy name, form, qualities and pastimes. When a conditioned soul is awakened to Krsna consciousness and renders service by using his tongue to chant the Lord's holy name and taste the remnants of the Lord's food, the tongue is purified, and one gradually comes to understand who Krsna really is.' (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 17.136)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna can only be understood by spiritual senses which become purified, beginning with the tongue. When the tongue is used for discussing transcendental topics about the Lord, then either by speaking about Krsna or by inquiring about Krsna, we can then take responsibility. We might say, \"I'm not Krsna conscious.\" But then you can inquire about Krsna. That's exactly what is happening right here in this exchange between Prithu Maharaja and Sanat-kumara.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrithu Maharaja took the position of being very fallen and engrossed in sense  gratification and he said, \"This is a very dangerous material existence because I'm entangled because of my previous actions in this material existence. How can any person who is so entangled in sense gratification have any good fortune in life? How can they be blessed with good fortune?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he took the position of asking, although he could have spoken. All realization was there but he took the position of asking. And Sanat-kumara says, \"Oh thank you so much. You are helping me. I'll benefit from this opportunity. You're engaging me in devotional service.\" He was so grateful. \"You're so merciful that you are giving me an opportunity to speak about transcendental topics. I know I can't speak about anything else because you're not interested in hearing anything else. I'm so grateful. I know I won't get away with talking about Maya to you because you don't want to hear anything about Maya. You are so kind. For my benefit you've asked this question. Thank you.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore both the speaker and the hearer, they benefit because the only topic is transcendental subject matter.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are many things that I wanted to speak about this morning but we have a schedule to follow today. I want to end at the appropriate time, at 9:00. I was going to read this later, but I'll read it now because I want to make sure it's read. It's a very wonderful verse from the fifth canto of the Bhagavatam. I really like it. It's spoken by Jada Bharata to Maharaja Rahugana.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Who are the pure devotees mentioned here? In an assembly of pure devotees, there is no question of discussing material subjects like politics and sociology. In an assembly of pure devotees, there is discussion only of the qualities, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is praised and worshiped with full attention. In the association of pure devotees, by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vasudeva.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPURPORT<br />\n\tThe symptoms of pure devotees are described in this verse. The pure devotee is never interested in material topics. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has strictly prohibited His devotees to talk about worldly matters. Gramya-varta na kahibe: [Cc. Antya 6.236] one should not indulge in talking unnecessarily about news of the material world. One should not waste time in this way. This is a very important feature in the life of a devotee. A devotee has no other ambition than to serve Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Krsna consciousness movement was started to engage people twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord and in His glorification. The students in this institution engage in the cultivation of Krsna consciousness from five in the morning to ten at night. They actually have no opportunity to waste their time unnecessarily by discussing politics, sociology and current events. These will go their own way. A devotee is concerned only with serving Krsna positively and seriously. [End of purport] (SB 5.12.13)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese will go their own way! In other words, they will go on anyways and it will be their own way. Of course, someone might say, \"Well this verse is speaking about an assembly of pure devotees, but I'm not a pure devotee.\" But we already established that the only real solution to the problems of life is to become purified. Any effort we make to try to counteract one fruitive activity by another fruitive activity is going to entangle us further. That's exactly what material life is. Material life is a constant endeavor to counteract reactions to past sinful life. And that's why Prithu Maharaja said, \"I'm a sense gratifier and my current situation is simply the result of my previous activities.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe didn't say, \"How do I counteract the results of my previous activities?\" That's how materialists think. How to avoid suffering to obtain happiness and to mitigate distress. Prahlada Maharaja explains:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"In this material world, every materialist desires to achieve happiness and diminish his distress, and therefore he acts accordingly. Actually, however, one is happy as long as one does not endeavor for happiness; as soon as one begins his activities for happiness, his conditions of distress begin. (SB 7.7.42)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAn intelligent person should try to stop the cycle. Not \"How do I counteract my past sinful reactions so that I can be [so-called] happy now.\" This happiness is temporary. Therefore Lord Rsabhadeva instructed his sons, instead one should look for \"brahma saukhyam\", real happiness, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAn intelligent person looks for the real solution. He becomes greedy for attaining the opportuinty to hear about Krsna, the only solution. Therefore when devotees get together, they utilize their time to its full potential. They don't waste time discussing politics, sociology and current events. These will go their own way!! They are going to go their own way. Why should we waste time discussing these things? No solution comes by discussing these things! They will still go their own way. Better I become Krsna conscious. Better I get together to discuss topics related to Krsna. It's in my hands. It's my responsibility to utilize my life wisely. In other words, it's my responsibilitiy to stay awake!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCertainly by \"divine grace\" somebody will come and tell us to wake up. Don't stay sleeping in the lap of the witch called Maya. But how to stay awake? The way to stay awake is to utilize this human life to it's full potential… and the best opportunity for this is in the association of devotees. A devotee will be eager to ask, \"Please, can you tell me something Krsna conscious?\" And we should say, \"Thank you. You saved me. My tendency would have been to talk nonsense but you saved me by asking the right question.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen when devotees become inspired in this way, what is the result? Prabhupada explains that in the commentary today. He says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"The word ubhayesam can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the materialist and the transcendentalist. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and transcendentalist are benefited.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, when devotees become inspired by topics about the Supreme Lord, then anybody who comes in contact with such discussions can also obtain divine grace. Devotees can be carriers of divine grace. Materialists become devotees by association with such devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth the devotees are benefitted and the materialists are benefitted. Or as it is stated in verse that we just read from the fifth canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, \"Even the impersonalists become devotees. The verse states that, \"…by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vasudeva.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo therefore when the sages asked their question to Suta Goswami, \"What is the supreme sacrifice, or highest activity, meant to benefit all humanity?\", the sages then performed that sacrifice by sitting and hearing the topics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who comes in contact with such discussions are reminded of the need to wake up. Once awake, they then become eager to stay awake.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat's why it's so important for devotees to regularly come together to discuss transcendental topics. When devotees come together, sometimes they think, \"What are we going to do with each other? Should we play football? That will keep us all engaged. Good exercise. What else? There must be other things that we can think of to keep us busy so that we don't fall into maya.\"[Devotees laugh]\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's so clear. Well someone may say, \"Well I don't have any taste for that. Well then Bhagavatam states that one should seek out the association of devotees who will give you some taste.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi<br />\n\tsarva-sanga-vivarjitah<br />\n\tsangas tesv atha te prarthyah<br />\n\tsanga-dosa-hara hi te\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\n\tO My mother, O virtuous lady, these are the qualities of great devotees who are free from all attachment.

There are many places stated that. Kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah yajanti anya-devatah [Bg. 7.20]. Krsna says that \"Those who are worshipers of other demigods...\" Actually worshipful is the Supreme Lord Krsna. Others, they should be shown respect. But worship means for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is worshipful. Saranyam. He is to be taken shelter of; He is to be worshiped. That is being taught. That is religion. Man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru [Bg. 18.65]. Always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, worshiping Him, offering Him obeisances, that is Krsna consciousness movement. The Deity room offering obeisances, worshiping, chanting, dancing, always be engaged to offer respect and submission to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the duty of everyone. Because all living entities are by constitution eternal servant. That is their healthy position. So long they remain servant of the Supreme, that is healthy. Same example, I have given many times, that my part and parcel of the body, this finger, so long it is fit to give service to the body, it is healthy. If it cannot give service, then it is diseased. Similarly, all living entities who are not giving, rendering any service to the Lord, they are simply working for sense gratification, that is diseased condition. And in the diseased condition, nobody can be happy. That is not possible. If you have got some disease, you cannot be happy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo that is the position. They cannot understand that by serving Krsna, we become healthy or in our normal position. This is called ignorance. Somebody is trying to forget Him, somebody is trying to become equal with Him. This business is going on. And nobody is submitting that \"My Lord, I forgot my service. From this day, I become again Your servant. Please give me protection.\" Sarva-dharman parityajya mam...

A sannyasi, they should be very cautious. Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, sannyasira alpa-chidre bahu kari' mane. An ordinary grhastha, or... Grhastha only, If he talks with woman nobody will blame. He is grhastha. But if a sannyasi talks with woman very intimately, oh, immediately people will take note of it. Sannyasira alpa-chidre bahu kari' mane. That is the practice.

Madhu-kaitabha-bhare hari-murare. Madhu-kaitabha-bhare. So, \"You are Madhusudana. You are the killer of Madhu demon, who was Your enemy. You are not Nanda-sudana or Yasoda-sudana.\" That is reminding Him, little critically, that \"You are Yourself Madhusudana. You kill only Your enemies. Why You are inducing me to kill my kinsmen?\" This is the criticism. So etan na hantum icchami. So \"You may induce me, but I am not going to kill them.\" Etan na hantum. Hantum, \"To kill, I am not willing.\" Then the question may be that \"It is fight. If you do not kill, if you stand still, then they will kill you. Because it is fight. Then what you will do?\" \"Yes, I agree.\" Ghnato 'pi. \"If they kill me, I agree. Still, I will not kill them.\" Ghnato 'pi. \"Even they kill me, I will not fight, I will not kill them. But if they kill me, that is also agreed; still, I will not kill.\" Just see how much determination. This is called family attraction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tExplanation:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is one of the many points Srila Prabhupada was using in the lecture to elaborate on Arjuna's attachment to family and why that made it impossible for Arjuna to fight. Srila Prabhupada introduced Arjuna's arguments to Krsna for resisting his duties in a way I had never heard them before. Whenever I think of the above quoted verse, I usually think that Arjuna addressed Krsna as \"Madhusudana\" because he was asking Krsna to destroy his own demon of doubts. But this argument is very interesting. He's saying, \"You are Madhusudana. You kill only Your enemies. So why, therefore, are You inducing me to kill my kinsmen?\", and then Prabhupada even suggests that Arjuna was being a little critical by suggesting this to Him. Of course, it is pastime, and Arjuna is never critical of Krsna. But it does illustrate the dangers of attachment and how it can run so deep that we will find any argument possible against the authority of the Lord, even to the point of finding some fault in Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tExcerpt:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[…]according to Vedic system, there are ten kinds of samskara, reformatory method. This upanayana-samskara, this is also one of the samskara, sacred thread. Upanayana. Upa means near, and nayana means bringing. When the spiritual master brings nearer to spiritual consciousness, a person is given the upanayana, or the sacred thread. The sacred thread is the indication that \"This man is now under the control of the spiritual master for advancing in Krsna consciousness.\" This thread ceremony. This is called upanayana. Similarly, there is reformatory method, marriage, ten kinds of reformatory... The first beginning is garbhadhana. So these things are impossible to introduce now in this Kali-yuga. Therefore the only reformatory method is: harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam, kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha [Cc. Adi 17.21]. In this age of Kali, people are so fallen, so degraded, that it is not possible to introduce systematically the whole Vedic principle; it is not possible. That is not possible. It is Caitanya Mahaprabhu's grace, mercy, that He has given us mercifully, vairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti [Cc. Madhya 6.254], just to teach very short-cut method. What is that? Chant Hare Krsna. Simple. Simple. Ceto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni [Cc. Antya 20.12].\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tExplanation:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe particular point which caught my attention in the above excerpt was Srila Prabhupada's indication that it is not possible to systematically introduce the whole Vedic principle in this age. He was not suggesting that upanayana samskara and garbhadhana samskara should not be performed. His comment was specifically about the \"whole Vedic principle\", which included the dasa-vidha-samskara (the ten Vedic household rituals for purification, performed one by one from the time of conception until death.) In fact, in a room conversation which took place just one week before this lecture I was listening to today, Srila Prabhupada had this to say:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tParamahamsa: Srila Prabhupada, I wanted to ask you that in your lectures you continually speak of the ten samskaras that children should have.<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: Well, that is not possible.<br />\r\n\tParamahamsa: Oh.<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada: That is not possible. It is very difficult. One samskara, that initiation samskara, and marriage samskara-two, three samskaras, can be done, not the ten. It is not possible. Now the circumstances will not allow. It is very difficult.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada is certainly not decrying the \"whole Vedic principle\". Certainly we must adopt Vedic principles within all the four asramas. But emphasis should always remain fixed on the \"short-cut method\", especially in this age. Without emphasis on chanting the pure holy name, without any offenses, there is no hope for achieving perfection in this age simply by following the \"whole Vedic principle.\" And Srila Prabhupada's mission was to teach Lord Caitanya's method which He, Himself, came to teach.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tvairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti-yoga-<br />\r\n\tsiksartham ekah purusah puranah<br />\r\n\tsri-krsna-caitanya-sarira-dhari<br />\r\n\tkrpambudhir yas tam aham prapadye\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\t\"Let me take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, who has descended in the form of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu to teach us real knowledge, His devotional service and detachment from whatever does not foster Krsna consciousness. He has descended because He is an ocean of transcendental mercy. Let me surrender unto His lotus feet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, the \"whole Vedic principle\" which is meant to guide the living being right from the time of his birth until the time of his death, by following a series of purificatory methods, can be achieved by the pure chanting of Krsna's holy names.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\titi sodasakam namnam<br />\r\n\tkali-kalmasa-nasanam<br />\r\n\tnatah parataropayah<br />\r\n\tsarva-vedesu drsyate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"After searching through all the Vedic literature, one cannot find a method of religion more sublime for this age than the chanting of Hare Krsna.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

If any candidate for initiation has a valid reason for not being able to attend the initiations in Magdalinivka and can only come to the Bhakti Sangama Festival, they should notify Madana-mohana dasa of this by email or in writing, prior to July 1, 2014.

I therefore wanted to be there, for no other reason than to be there with him, knowing that it could be a very overwhelming visit for him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe festival began outside Geneva at a rented facility in the foothills of the Alps. About seventy devotees assembled for the opening festivities on May 29th, many of them older devotees who either joined in the 1970's or early 1980's.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately, when applying for harinama permits in Geneva, the authorities tried to impose a long list of strict rules for the harinama. Guru Gauranga Prabhu had to negotiate with them on almost every point. An agreement was finally reached which limited the harinama to fifteen people. There also had to be four people dressed with flourescent vests assigned for security and for keeping the devotees in line. If I were to write the list of restrictions, it would take up another full page. But, somehow, by Krsna's grace, we managed to chant the holy names in downtown Geneva and along the banks of Lake Geneva for over three hours (see video on the bottom of the home page), and passed through the places where devotees used to regularly chant back in the 1970's.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile harinama was going on in Geneva, the rest of the devotees heard many stories about the early days in Switzerland from some of the early pioneers of the Swiss yatra, such as Rohini Suta Prabhu, Prthu Prabhu, and Jaya Gurudeva Prabhu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe harinama party returned by 6:00 PM and honored some very wonderful prasadam the local devotees prepared, three times a day, for all of the attendees. The rest of the evening was spent hearing from all who assembled as they told us their names, their connection with the Swiss yatra, and a little bit about themselves. It was a very intimate event which ended by 10:00 PM.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn the following day, after a full morning program, Guru Gauranga Prabhu took at least forty of us on pilgrimage to the places Srila Prabhupada visited during his nine-day visit in 1974, including the park where he took his daily walks, the old temple which Srila Prabhupada stayed in, and the larger temple they acquired some years later (see photos).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur first stop was the first temple. We drove there in six separate vehicles, one behind the other, not really knowing what we would do once we got there other than to look at the front of the building. In the car on our way to the pilgrimage site, Guru Gauranga Prabhu expressed a very strong desire to go inside, though he admitted that he could not imagine what kind of reaction the people living there would have when asked if the devotees could be allowed in. I had to confess, that I had my doubts too. Still he expressed determination to ask and resigned himself to leaving the rest up to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe small building was on a very small and quiet residential street. Behind the building was a large housing development which was built since the time the devotees had lived there. Across the street was a large school which was also seemed newly constructed. But somehow, on that particular street, all the old buildings were still standing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile we all stood out front, examining the building, Guru Gauranga Prabhu decided to knock on the door to see if anyone was home. I was thinking that even if the person was home, they might be a little fearful about answering the door. It's not every day that forty to fifty people stand outside the front of one's home, examining the building and looking for opportunities to see what's inside. To a casual observer, it almost looked as if it was a protest of sorts and we were getting ready to storm the building.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter a short exchange with the owner, she very warmly welcomed anyone who wanted to come inside and walk around to their heart's content. None of us could really believe how hospitable this woman was towards the devotees. One by one, they all walked through the house while Guru Gauranga Prabhu reminisced about Prabhupada's visit, pointing out which room he stayed in, which room he slept in, and which room he spoke in. The devotees eagerly listened while touring the building.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then decided to visit the backyard where Srila Prabhupada conducted initiations during his visit. Again, the woman invited all of us to sit there while Guru Gauranga Prabhu led a short and emotional kirtan, after which he shared a few short stories about the initiations that transpired there forty years prior. During this time, one godbrother of mine was speaking casually to the woman who lived there with her children, and almost apologetically, said to her, \"We must look a little bit strange to you, don't we\", to which she replied, \"Maybe… but you are all so very nice!\" She had been very much won over by the devotees' dealings with her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur pilgrimage then continued to the other places where the devotees formerly served as we all listened attentively to stories told about the \"early days\" in Geneva. Unfortunately there is currently no temple in Geneva, but devotees regularly visit for local nama hatta programs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then returned to the festival site for another evening of remembrances and stories from the early pioneers who were instrumental for the establishment and growth of the Swiss yatra.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe following morning after the morning program, Guru Gauranga Prabhu, one other godbrother and myself drove a short distance across the border into France to look for the small temple a few devotees stayed in while they gradually established their presence in Geneva. Unfortunately it was no longer there, but Guru Gauranga said he could not leave Geneva without at least trying to see if it was still there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then returned to Zurich, honored lunch prasadam and went out on harinama. This time there was at least one hundred enthusiastic devotees, chanting and dancing in a beautiful park along the lake, filled with hundreds of local people and tourists, many of whom seemed to greatly appreciate the devotees' presence (see photos). After two hours of chanting and dancing, we then returned to the temple where more of the same (remembrances) continued well into the evening.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Sunday, Srimad Bhagavatam class in the morning was given by Rohini Suta Prabhu. Festivities were then held throughout the rest of the day. Gradually, the temple also filled up with the usual Sunday Feast guests, filling the whole building as well as the garden out front, with a very festive atmosphere. Bhajans were led in the afternoon by Locanananda Prabhu, I was then asked to give the Sunday lecture, and after the lecture one of the most incredible feasts I have seen for many years was served out to the hundreds of guests who were in attendance. I couldn't resist tasting at least some of the preparations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the evening, Locanananda Prabhu and I led bhajans, and the festival came to a close. I felt overwhelmed by the association I was able to experience, nonstop, for the five days I was in Switzerland. Not only did I get the opportunity to meet many of the current devotees of the Swiss yatra, but I was also able to spend some intimate time with several godbrothers who, other than Guru Gauranga Prabhu, I had not seen for a very long time. Needless to say, for me, it was this association which made my visit to Switzerland a very memorable event.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

We drove there in six separate vehicles, one behind the other, not really knowing what we would do once we got there other than to look at the front of the building. In the car on our way to the pilgrimage site, Guru Gauranga Prabhu expressed a very strong desire to go inside, though he admitted that he could not imagine what kind of reaction the people living there would have when asked if the devotees could be allowed in. I had to confess, that I had my doubts too. Still he expressed determination to ask and resigned himself to leaving the rest up to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe small building was on a very small and quiet residential street. Behind the building was a large housing development which was built since the time the devotees had lived there. Across the street was a large school which was also seemed newly constructed. But somehow, on that particular street, all the old buildings were still standing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile we all stood out front, examining the building, Guru Gauranga Prabhu decided to knock on the door to see if anyone was home. I was thinking that even if the person was home, they might be a little fearful about answering the door. It's not every day that forty to fifty people stand outside the front of one's home, examining the building and looking for opportunities to see what's inside. To a casual observer, it almost looked as if it was a protest of sorts and we were getting ready to storm the building.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter a short exchange with the owner, she very warmly welcomed anyone who wanted to come inside and walk around to their heart's content. None of us could really believe how hospitable this woman was towards the devotees. One by one, they all walked through the house while Guru Gauranga Prabhu reminisced about Prabhupada's visit, pointing out which room he stayed in, which room he slept in, and which room he spoke in. The devotees eagerly listened while touring the building.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe then decided to visit the backyard where Srila Prabhupada conducted initiations during his visit. Again, the woman invited all of us to sit there while Guru Gauranga Prabhu led a short and emotional kirtan, after which he shared a few short stories about the initiations that transpired there forty years prior. During this time, one godbrother of mine was speaking casually to the woman who lived there with her children, and almost apologetically, said to her, \"We must look a little bit strange to you, don't we\", to which she replied, \"Maybe… but you are all so very nice!\" She had been very much won over by the devotees' dealings with her.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOur pilgrimage then continued to the other places where the devotees formerly served as we all listened attentively to stories told about the \"early days\" in Geneva. Unfortunately there is currently no temple in Geneva, but devotees regularly visit for local nama hatta programs.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe then returned to the festival site for another evening of remembrances and stories from the early pioneers who were instrumental for the establishment and growth of the Swiss yatra.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe following morning after the morning program, Guru Gauranga Prabhu, one other godbrother and myself drove a short distance across the border into France to look for the small temple a few devotees stayed in while they gradually established their presence in Geneva. Unfortunately it was no longer there, but Guru Gauranga said he could not leave Geneva without at least trying to see if it was still there.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe then returned to Zurich, honored lunch prasadam and went out on harinama. This time there was at least one hundred enthusiastic devotees, chanting and dancing in a beautiful park along the lake, filled with hundreds of local people and tourists, many of whom seemed to greatly appreciate the devotees' presence (see photos). After two hours of chanting and dancing, we then returned to the temple where more of the same (remembrances) continued well into the evening.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Sunday, Srimad Bhagavatam class in the morning was given by Rohini Suta Prabhu. Festivities were then held throughout the rest of the day. Gradually, the temple also filled up with the usual Sunday Feast guests, filling the whole building as well as the garden out front, with a very festive atmosphere. Bhajans were led in the afternoon by Locanananda Prabhu, I was then asked to give the Sunday lecture, and after the lecture one of the most incredible feasts I have seen for many years was served out to the hundreds of guests who were in attendance. I couldn't resist tasting at least some of the preparations.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the evening, Locanananda Prabhu and I led bhajans, and the festival came to a close. I felt overwhelmed by the association I was able to experience, nonstop, for the five days I was in Switzerland. Not only did I get the opportunity to meet many of the current devotees of the Swiss yatra, but I was also able to spend some intimate time with several godbrothers who, other than Guru Gauranga Prabhu, I had not seen for a very long time. Needless to say, for me, it was this association which made my visit to Switzerland a very memorable event.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tI am currently in transit in Munich, having just flown from Bologna on my way to Zurich. I just spent five days with my godbrother, Trai Prabhu, in Bologna. During that time, I was given the opportunity to spend intimate time with many of the people that Trai Prabhu and his wife have been, inspiring, helping and engaging in the activities of the Bologna preaching center.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMany years ago I decided that I would try my best to visit Trai Prabhu every year in order to get his association as well as to help him in any way possible with his preaching center in Bologna. Although Trai Prabhu had been steadily distributing Srila Prabhupada's books for the past forty years, and most of that time in Italy, he felt a strong desire to do something more for Srila Prabhupada.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, several years ago, Trai Prabhu decided to move from his former residence in Italy to pioneer a preaching center with his wife, Krsnaloka devi dasi. There was a very small group of devotees in Bologna but there was really no outreach for the people living there. So they rented a small room near the center of the city, lived there, and just started conducting programs there, doing harinamas, and contacting as many people as possible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt first it was a struggle, without much result. But by their steady determination to find a way to reach out to the local people, they now have a large congregation, with many devotees becoming very serious about Krsna consciousness. There are programs every night at the preaching center, including a Kirtan Yoga Evening, conducted by Prema Kumara dasa, one of the first devotees who came from their preaching efforts in Bologna. There is also a cooking class one evening conducted by Krsnaloka devi dasi, a meditation class conducted by Kaliya Krsna dasa, and their weekly feast program is on Saturday, conducted by Trai Prabhu.

During that time, I was given the opportunity to spend intimate time with many of the people that Trai Prabhu and his wife have been, inspiring, helping and engaging in the activities of the Bologna preaching center.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMany years ago I decided that I would try my best to visit Trai Prabhu every year in order to get his association as well as to help him in any way possible with his preaching center in Bologna. Although Trai Prabhu had been steadily distributing Srila Prabhupada's books for the past forty years, and most of that time in Italy, he felt a strong desire to do something more for Srila Prabhupada.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, several years ago, Trai Prabhu decided to move from his former residence in Italy to pioneer a preaching center with his wife, Krsnaloka devi dasi. There was a very small group of devotees in Bologna but there was really no outreach for the people living there. So they rented a small room near the center of the city, lived there, and just started conducting programs there, doing harinamas, and contacting as many people as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt first it was a struggle, without much result. But by their steady determination to find a way to reach out to the local people, they now have a large congregation, with many devotees becoming very serious about Krsna consciousness. There are programs every night at the preaching center, including a Kirtan Yoga Evening, conducted by Prema Kumara dasa, one of the first devotees who came from their preaching efforts in Bologna. There is also a cooking class one evening conducted by Krsnaloka devi dasi, a meditation class conducted by Kaliya Krsna dasa, and their weekly feast program is on Saturday, conducted by Trai Prabhu. They also go out on harinamas during the warm weather, and as many as twenty devotees participate in their harinamas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOver eighty people, all of them from Bologna, attended the program I took part in on Saturday evening.

I decided to dedicate all of my reading time to readings about Srila Prabhupada.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI first starting reading \"Memories - Anecdotes of a Modern-Saint\", which is a collection of interviews recorded by Siddhanta Prabhu when he decided to interview devotees for his \"Remembrances of Srila Prabhupada\" video series. As I was reading and very much relishing these memories, I began thinking how nice it would be to read Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita once again. So I started reading the \"Memories\" book and \"Srila Prabhupada Lilamarita\" side by side… switching back and forth between the two books over the course of the day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI must confess that the last time I read the entire \"Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita\" was when each book of the seven-book series first came out during the 1980's. I had forgotten many of the details. I have a tendency to read every book about Srila Prabhupada as soon as it's published. The same thing happened when \"Miracle on Second Avenue\" came out a few years back by H.H. Mukunda Goswami. I was given an advance copy by the publisher in Mayapura, so I sat and read it in two days, finding myself unable to put it down. I've noticed, however, that after I finish reading a biography of Srila Prabhupada, I just think of it as a book \"already read.\" So I don't go back and read it again. I've now discovered that tendency as a terrible mistake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo far I've read the first two volumes of Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita along with my other readings about Srila Prabhupada. I can't begin to express how inspirational it's been for me reflect on the evolution of Srila Prabhupada's missionary spirit, beginning from his first meeting with Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur. I'm feeling so fortunate and very grateful for having such a detailed account of Srila Prabhupada's struggles and constant endeavors to serve the orders given to him by his spiritual master.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaving served in the same zone as H.H. Satsvarupa das Goswami in the early 1980's leading up to my acceptance of sannyasa from him in 1986, I'm well aware of the extent of the research both he and his assistants had to do in preparation for \"Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta.\" So much information was unearthed about Srila Prabhupada's early years as a householder, the people who remembered him during his householder years, the people who remotely assisted him during his years just prior to accepting sannyasa, the efforts he made to work conjointly with his godbrothers for fulfilling Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's wishes for spreading Krsna consciousness to the English-speaking world, his preaching in India, and especially his relentless commitment to writing and publishing Back to Godhead, other works, and then his three-volume translation and commentary of the First Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam completed just weeks prior to his month-long journey to the United States.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI've found myself overwhelmed with gratitude, both to Satsvarupa Maharaja and especially to Srila Prabhupada, and at the same time, immensely humbled by reflecting upon the tiny and insignificant efforts I've made in this life to spread Krsna consciousness in comparison to what Srila Prabhupada has done to expand Krsna consciousness throughout this world. In fact, I've realized that it would be an offense on my part to even attempt to make such a comparison.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'm reminded of the purport in the Ninth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam wherein Srila Prabhupada writes:<br />\r\n\t\"Mother Ganges is worshiped by the water of the Ganges: a devotee takes a little water from the Ganges and offers it back to the Ganges. When the devotee takes the water, mother Ganges does not lose anything, and when the water is offered back, mother Ganges does not increase, but in this way the worshiper of the Ganges is benefited. Similarly, a devotee of the Lord offers the Lord patram puspam phalam toyam [Bg. 9.26] -- a leaf, flower, fruit or water -- in great devotion, but everything, including the leaf, flower, fruit and water, belongs to the Lord, and therefore there is nothing to renounce or to accept. One must simply take advantage of the bhakti process because by following this process one does not lose anything but one gains the favor of the Supreme Person.\" (S.B. 9.9.12)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAny little effort I've made to spread Krsna consciousness has come from Srila Prabhupada's unlimited efforts to give this whole planet Krsna consciousness… an effort which, somehow, by my incomparable fortune, captured this tiny jiva within Srila Prabhupada's loving network of Lord Caitanya's mercy. How can I compare something I've done with somebody who is completely responsible for anything good that I've done? I should not be so foolish.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile reading \"Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita\", I was also reminded of so many of Srila Prabhupada's early writings such as his early \"Back to Godhead\" magazines, which are available, going back as early as 1944, his essays published in the \"Gaudiya Patrika\" in 1948 and 1949 under the title \"Renunciation Through Wisdom\", and his \"Light of the Bhagavata\" which Srila Prabhupada wrote in 1961 in response to an invitation he received to attend a world conference, the Congress for Cultivating the Human Spirit, held in Japan. So many of his early writings are coming to mind that I'm making a list of them for my future readings in order to help me further capture his preaching mood in those earlier days for my own self-reflection.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'd like to take this opportunity to encourage every one of my readers to please, please, please (that's three times for emphasis) read the whole \"Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita\" from cover to cover. Please don't let your life pass by without making the effort to increase your awareness and appreciation of Srila Prabhupada.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, when I first thought about writing this blog, I checked to see if the full seven volume \"Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita\" has been translated into Russian yet. To my dismay, I discovered that, to date, only the abridged version of \"Srila Prabhupada Lilamrita\" has been published in Russian. So today I spoke with Bhakti Vijnana Goswami and inquired when, and if, the full version will be published in Russian. I was relieved to learn that the first volume, \"A Lifetime in Preparation\" will be available for distribution some time this summer. Subsequent volumes will also be coming, hopefully, soon thereafter. Please be sure to keep abreast of it's release date so that you can acquire a copy as soon as it becomes available.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

The cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And the cause of happiness is knowing Krsna to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being, the proprietor of all lands and planets, and the sincerest friend of all living entities. The perfect yogi knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with Krsna. And because one in Krsna consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of Krsna everywhere. Since the perfect yogi tries to broadcast the importance of becoming Krsna conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah (Bg. 18.69). In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is the best yogi because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogi interested only in his personal elevation. The yogi who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward Krsna consciousness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI've been finding myself talking a lot about Srila Prabhupada recently. My desire to speak more about him was probably stimulated this year in Mayapura when I read a booklet produced by a committee of our GBC body about Srila Prabhupada's position as the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON. Essentially it was just a wonderful book that established, very conclusively, the meaning of \"Founder-Acarya… not only based upon Srila Prabhupada's position in ISKCON but also based upon the position of \"Founder-Acarya\" in our sampradaya.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was very enlivened after reading this booklet. I read it one day when I was sick and was unable to attend the meetings. It deepened my conviction about the importance of preserving Srila Prabhupada's presence within the International Society for Krsna consciousness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe word \"Acarya\" in Founder-Acarya means that Srila Prabhupada is the ultimate teacher by his own example in ISKCON. Being a perfect teacher by example, therefore, everything he does is instructive because, as followers, we are meant to aspire to strictly follow his example.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada would oftentimes speak about the difference between following in the footsteps and imitating. He would say that following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas means that we follow the same path they themselves walked. It also means to follow their instructions. Therefore, mahajano yena gatah sa panthah....they leave behind instructions by which their followers can traverse the same path as they themselves also traversed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tImitating means that we try to artificially imitate the position of being fully realized without being fully realized.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada would oftentimes quote the verse,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tyad yad acarati sresthas<br />\r\n\ttat tad evetaro janah<br />\r\n\tsa yat pramanam kurute<br />\r\n\tlokas tad anuvartate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\r\n\tWhatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is Krsna's instruction in Bhagavad-gita. He explains why He had to also teach by setting an example because if He didn't then the whole world would be put to ruination.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada's instructions were so potent because he did what he was preaching. In English, we have an expression, I don't know if there is a comparable one in Russian, \"He walks his talk.\" In other words, his actions are fully consistent with his words. Because he was so elevated, he would sometimes give an instruction which would seem almost impossible to follow. But his example was always there as the extra strength for us to try.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe all experienced that during Srila Prabhupada's manifest presence in our Krsna consciousness movement. Srila Prabhupada was inspiring his followers to become ghostianandis, to preach Krsna consciousness, and not to become concerned simply about one's own enlightenment. There was an overwhelming emphasis on spreading Krsna consciousness and there was an enthusiasm to do so because we always had his example. We may not be Krsna conscious, but we could always preach boldly and strongly that it exists because we could always point to Prabhupada.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn one sense it was very simple in those early years because Prabhupada was not only our Founder-Acarya, but he was the only guru. When someone became qualified for initiation, they knew who they were going to be initiated by and who they were going to serve. That gave Srila Prabhupada's followers great strength and conviction to preach his message. We felt Prabhupada was therefore us and was carefully watching to make sure we didn't deviate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe said, \"Don't change the message. Keep it intact.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI remember one lecture when Srila Prabhupada found something in the transcription he was reading which was different from that which he dictated. He became very disturbed. In the lecture Prabhupada said, \"Don't be overintelligent.\" Don't think that you know more or you know better than your spiritual master.\" He said, \"Your potency will be in your ability to simply repeat what I have given to you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we could repeat everything that Prabhupada told us and we always had the full confidence and support that the example was there for others to see. This gave us great strength to preach, and to preach boldly, because Srila Prabhupada always emphasized to preach boldly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe told us to \"Boil the milk and make it thicker.\" In other words, don't compromise. Don't water Krsna consciousness down to something it isn't. Krsna is already all-attractive. Don't ever water Krsna consciousness down.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was telling a story to a group of devotees in Kaliningrad the other day. I was remembering one conversation that Srila Prabhupada had... I can't remember what year it was. I think it might have been 1975.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe was visited by one well-known yogi at that time. His name was Yogi Bhajan. I never met Yogi Bhajan but in 1971, I was living with a group of people who were his followers. It was before I read Srila Prabhupada's Bhagavad-gita. They used to speak a lot about him to me. But I had no particular appeal or attraction to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnyway, Prabhupada was visited by this yogi along with two of his secretaries. He came to invite Srila Prabhupada to a conference called the \"Unity of Man\" conference. He was promoting himself as the organizer of the conference and he was inviting and also visiting popular yogis, mystics, saints, and sadhus to extend invitations. He was promoting this conference as if it would benefit all of humanity. So he said, \"We want you to come, Swamiji. Please come and we'll give you a slot and you can speak. Become part of our united effort to save the world.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada tried to explain to him that there's only one way that humanity can be united. He said, \"We can only be united if we surrender to Krsna.\" So he asked, \"Therefore Bhagavad-gita will be preached and Krsna's message will be preached exclusively at the conference?\" And then Yogi Bhajan said, \"Yes. That will be there. But there will be many other sages, mystics and saints and they will give their teachings. In this way we can all be united in harmony, with the same goal.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada said, \"No. There's only one goal. Krsna's goal. We have to follow Krsna otherwise how can we become united?\" Prabhupada used the example about the United Nations. He would say that the United Nations means that even though many countries come together, they have their own flag and they represent their own interests. They are mainly interested in their own interests. That's all. So he said that United Nations simply means that there are more flags. Therefore United Nations simply means that we add more flags but there's no real unity because everyone is simply representing their own interests. They want to make sure that their own interests are being secured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo he was expressing this same point to Yogi Bhajan, that actually there is only one interest… Krsna's interest. So he explained why he didn't want to attend. He said, \"You can have your conference but I will not attend.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Yogi Bhajan was a little persistent because he felt that if Prabhupada attended more people would come. Prabhupada didn't want to be used that way. Yogi Bhajan really tried to make it look really nice, \"If you come, it will be so nice, so wonderful, it will be a real good example for the world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYogi Bhajan's secretaries were sitting and taking notes. Prabhupada was noticing this as he was speaking. So Prabhupada just turned to Yogi Bhajan and said, \"Write this down in your notebook. Bhaktivedanta Swami says that without Krsna, there will be no unity. Put that in your notebook. Make sure that you write it down.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYoga Bhajan tried one more time by explaining how it would be such a wonderful experience. Prabhupada finished the whole conversation by making one statement. He says, \"If you go into the latrine and you throw scented water on stool, does that make it a nice place?\" Prabhupada was trying to explain, \"That's what you are trying to do. You are trying to make everything a nice place, but without Krsna you cannot make this a nice place.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt that particular point, one of the people accompanying him got a little incensed, so they got up and they left. Prabhupada simply laughed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSomeone may say, \"Why didn't Prabhupada take the opportunity to preach at the event?\" Because&nbsp; he didn't want to compromise Krsna consciousness. He was an uncompromised example of Krsna consciousness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is another story I like about Prabhupada and his bold preaching.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada was invited in Jagannath Puri to inaugurate a book that one local author had written. Many famous people were there to do the inauguration. So Prabhupada saw this as a very good opportunity to preach boldly because he was very disturbed that his disciples were not being allowed to take darshan of Lord Jagannath. He therefore accepted the invitation although the organizers didn't know that was Prabhupada's intention. The organizers arranged for all the other invited guests to speak about the book first and then Prabhupada was to speak last. So one by one each dignitary came and spoke about the author's book, glorified him, and said things about the book. Prabhupada was then invited to speak.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada immediately began speaking how Lord Jagannath is the Lord of the universe. He's not just Lord of the Hindus, not just Lord of the Indians. He's the Lord of universe. And because He's the Lord of the universe that means that everyone has a relationship with Lord Jagannath. He gave a very powerful talk about the Lord's position, quoting Bhagavad-gita, aham bija-pradah pita.... Krsna says, \"I am the seed-giving father of all living beings.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo he was challenging, \"Why are you not allowing Vaisnavas to take darshan of Lord Jagannath?\" He spoke for some time and the organizers were starting to get a little anxious. They were standing on the side and were saying, \"Swamiji, the book. Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada didn't even look at them. He continued like fire. \"Swamiji, Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada just waited until he finished his message. He then looked up at them and they said, \"Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada picked up the book and said, \"Oh yes. This book is inaugurated\" and then he threw it on the table and walked off the stage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinished. So bold. He was so bold. He could be bold. Of course Prabhupada even sometimes said to us, he said, \"I can do this because I'm an old man. Don't imitate. Because he would be that way and people would still respect him and listen to him. He would caution us though. He wanted us to preach boldly but to be careful to not imitate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada was also a gentleman. He would not publicly criticize. Even when people would ask Prabhupada, for example, if they would ask, \"Can you tell me? What is your opinion of Yogi Bhajan?\" And Prabhupada would say, \"What is his philosophy?\" So he would make the person explain what is the philosophy of Yogi Bhajan. I'm using him just as a hypothetical example. But he did it with many people because people would sometimes ask Prabhupada's opinion about... at that time there was a lot... for instance there was Krsnamurti, who was very popular, Guru Maharaji, the so-called \"perfect master\". Then there were so many gods around too. Prabhupada also had to deal with questions about all of these gods. So Prabhupada would ask, \"What is his philosophy?\" Upon hearing the philosophy he would then rip it to pieces. He would expose the impersonal conclusion or whatever misrepresantation of the absolute truth that it was. But he would not openly criticize the individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe did this a lot with Vivekananda. Although he would not go out of his way to criticize publicly, but he would definitely do it in private conversations and lectures with disciples. If he was asked publicly he would have to defend Krsna. He was always defending Krsna. He was always defending the sampradaya.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne time Prabhupada was sitting in a room with Indian people… I think it was in Bombay. One gentleman was challenging Prabhupada because Prabhupada was using strong words. I think he might have been using \"rascals\" or \"mudhas\". And the man was saying, \"Swamiji, you are supposed to be sama darsinah. Why are you speaking like this?\" Prabhupada replied, \"Oh, sama darsinah? That is a higher platform. I'm not on that platform. I have to discriminate. But I discriminate because I see who is following Krsna's instructions and who is not following Krsna's instructions. And Krsna says, \"avajananti mam mudha\", He says \"na mam duskritino mudha\". He gave examples how Krsna used strong language, \"mudha\". \"So therefore I simply present what Krsna says. I have to discriminate, who follows and who doesn't follow. But I give Krsna's instructions to everyone. In this sense I don't discriminate. This is my sama darsinah. I tell everyone what Krsna says, indiscriminately.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd then the man said, \"But Swamiji, what do you do? You are simply repeating what somebody else said. What are you doing?\" Of course, this is Prabhupada's whole mission. Bhagavad-gita AS IT IS. That was his whole mission. His mission was to give Krsna's instruction as Krsna gave it. Therefore he was presenting Krsna's words, explaining what Krsna's words were and then he was teaching by his own example how he would surrender to Krsna's words. Therefore Prabhupada's words had so much potency to change people because he didn't compromise. He gave Krsna's words and he taught by his example, being fully surrendered to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere was an example of somebody who gave Krsna's instructions and then pushed everybody beyond their own self-imposed limits, whoever was sincere enough and could understand that, \"Yes, he's following. I have to follow too.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada would never compromise. That was his compassion. Some people may say, \"Oh, it looks like arrogance. Why wouldn't he compromise for people?\" But that was his compassion. Atmaupamyena sarvatra. That's exactly what this verse is about in Bhagavad-gita.\"He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!\" His compassion was that, \"They can only be saved if they take shelter at Krsna's lotus feet. How can I give anything else? Anything else would be violence.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis was his compassion because he was fully realized in what is real happiness, and because he saw all living entities as parts and parcels of Krsna, he knew that the only thing that could make them happy is to connect them to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIsopanisad says, \"One who always sees all living entities as spiritual sparks, in quality one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of things. What, then, can be illusion or anxiety for him?\" Srila Prabhupada was never experiencing any material anxiety. He had only one anxiety and that was the sufferings of others. That was his anxiety. Why? Because he was satisfied. He had his connection with Krsna and therefore he didn't need anything from anyone for himself. Thus, he could give Krsna unlimitedly to everyone without compromising.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore he was a perfect yogi who could see why others were suffering. He knew their source of suffering, as he says right here in this commentary, \"the cause of distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God.\" Prabhupada went right to the root cause.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSomeone may say, \"Well, there's so many other causes of distress. I could make a big, long list.\" But Prabhupada would go right to the root— forgetfulness of one's relationship with God— because as soon as one establishes a connection with the Supreme Lord… no more birth, no more death. Moreover, whatever distress they may experience in this life is just burning up whatever reactions were left from previous lives, thus finishing their connection with the material world. Isn't that compassion? He felt that kind of compassion and that's why he was so uncompromising. \"How can I give them anything less than Krsna?\" That was his love. That was his equality. That was his kindness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo he gave Krsna uncompromisingly, and he was very careful to preserve that same method of distribution for the future. He therefore taught his followers to give Krsna to others. And he also expected his followers for future generations to preserve his teachings and this example.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo even though we may not be fully Krsna conscious, we still have to know what is the goal— the example that we want to come to ourselves? We cannot imitate complete Krsna consciousness. But at least we must try to come to that platform. And even though we cannot imitate Srila Prabhupada's perfect, Krsna conscious vision of the world, we must keep his method of preaching intact by preserving what he's given to us in its most potent form— in his books— without imposing any of our own interpretation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEvery page of Bhagavad-gita as it is pure devotional service. Every page of Srimad Bhagavatam is pure devotional service. It's not anything else. It's pure devotional service... beginning, middle and end. Therefore those who are true followers of Srila Prabhupada will keep his message intact. We still have his example. We can still talk about it. We can still remember that example. We should know what that example is. Everyone should know Srila Prabhupada. If you don't know Srila Prabhupada, you're losing. He's the perfect example. Otherwise, how do we know what platform to aspire for unless we have the perfect example? If we don't know, we'll start thinking, \"Oh I could be like this, I could be like that.\" No. He's our Founder-Acarya for all time— not just for twelve years while he was present on the planet. He's the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON for as long as ISKCON is present.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada was very, very strong on this point. Whenever he saw the slightest discrepancy in being presented without the title \"Founder-Acarya\", he would immediately correct it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne time Srila Prabhupada came to the new BBT headquarters in Los Angeles and in the front there was a sign, \"Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.\" Prabhupada said, \"Where is Founder-Acarya? Why is it not there?\" Devotees were shocked. He wanted to make sure that \"Founder-Acarya\" was on everything. Why? Someone may think it was vanity. No. There was never any pride in Prabhupada. It was his compassion. He wanted to make sure his vision prevailed for the Krsna consciousness movement. Therefore Founder-Acarya had to be everywhere because he wanted to ensure that everyone would be led to Krsna's lotus feet.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat is the mission we experienced in his presence. We'd bring everyone to Prabhupada's lotus feet because we were confident he was connecting them to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we need that example. Yes. The goal is to find shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna, and the example of how to find shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna is in our Founder-Acarya.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada's books are the foundation of the Krsna consciousness movement. Nobody else's books are as important as Prabhupada's books. When people come to our temples they should immediately see only Prabhupada's books... a grand display. We should be eager, excited, ecstatic, to introduce people to Srila Prabhupada's books.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada's books change lives… not just during his manifest presence. They are still changing lives and will continue to change lives. There's so many stories about how people's lives have been changed by coming in contact with Prabhupada in his books.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI like to tell this story. It's a wonderful story. Quite some time back, I was visiting the temple in Montreal. During the visit, I was writing my Vyasa Puja offering to Srila Prabhupada. Usually we have a deadline in order for it to be published in the annual Vyasa Puja book and the deadline was the next day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo I was sitting in my room about to begin writing my Vyasa Puja offering. What oftentimes happens, however, whenever it comes to write a Vyasa Puja offering, I sit there and I go blank for a little while, thinking about what I am going to write. So I was just sitting, looking at the screen thinking, \"Where to start?\" Starting is usually the hardest part. Once I'm started I can get going.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll of a sudden there was a knock on the door. It was the Temple President. He said, \"Maharaja, there's a gentleman who came to the temple and there's nobody here. Would you take a little time to talk to him and answer his questions?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo I said, \"You know. I have one hour right now. And I need this one hour to write my offering in time for the deadline tomorrow. So he said, \"He's probably got just a few questions. I'm sure it won't be very long.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo I agreed. I went into the temple reception area and there was one man, probably in his 60's. He introduced himself and asked if we could sit down. So I shook his hand and sat down.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe then just started talking. \"Do you know that I was the caption of Montreal police back in 1973?\" It might have been 1974. I can't remember exactly the year he told me. \"I was at the airport when your Prabhupada came. I saw him, I looked at him and I could see that here's a very saintly person. For what I know right now about him, I wish I would have just given everything up right then and there and became his disciple.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo I said, \"Really? How is it that you know more now?\" He then reached in his pocket and pulled out a pocket-sized Bhagavad-gita. This Bhagavad-gita looked like it had been really read a lot. He said, \"You see this Bhagavad-gita? I've read it thirty-two times.\" I said, \"Thirty-two times?\" He said, \"Yes. Thirty-two times and still counting. I don't go anywhere without it. I read it every day. Sometimes I take my wife to the shopping mall and she says, 'I may be awhile and you'll have to wait.' and I say, 'No problem. I've got my Bhagavad-gita. Take as long as you want.' In fact, my wife is shopping right now. But I saw that the temple was so close by that I decided to come. I could read Bhagavad-gita again and again and it's always fresh.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe then opened the Bhagavad-gita and started reading verses from it, and then he started talking again about Prabhupada. \"He was such a beautiful person. I don't know why I did not become his disciple.\" He started to tell everything that he saw at the airport.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe went on talking and talking and I was thinking, \"I thought that I was going to answer some questions but there are no questions being asked. He just wants to talk.\" So I just sat there and was just mystified listening to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll of a sudden he said, \"Oh, I think my wife is probably ready by now.\" He had been talking for about forty-five minutes mostly about Prabhupada. He got up, went to the door and started to say good-bye. Then he said, \"You know, my wife and I read Prabhupada Lilamrita every night together. She won't read Bhagavad-gita. But I can get her to read Prabhupada Lilamrita. And every night we read about Prabhupada. He then started telling me the latest story he read from Prabhupada Lilamrta.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis went on for about another ten to fifteen minutes as he stood by the door with his hand on door knob and the door half-opened. Then he said, \"I really have to go now. It's been nice talking with you\", and he left.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI probably didn't say more than five words. I looked at my watch and one hour passed. I was thinking, \"Oh no. I lost my one hour!\" I had a program coming up and therefore lost the hour I was hoping to use for writing my Vyasa Puja offering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs it turned out, the next morning I sat down and just wrote the whole story about my meeting with the former Captain, and that was my Vyasa Puja offering. I saw how Krsna just sent him to write my Vyasa Puja offering for me because I couldn't come up with anything myself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnyway, my realization is that Prabhupada is still changing lives. That man was so attached to Prabhupada. It seemed to me that the gateway to the spiritual world will be open to him for the attachment he has to Krsna's pure devotee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI could tell so many other stories but the point is that it's so important to make Srila Prabhupada's books available to people. People are hankering to know someone like Prabhupada and we have a responsibility, as his followers, to make sure that Prabhupada is always accessible to everyone. We should be carefrul to never eclipse Srila Prabhupada.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor instance how do we make Krsna accessible? We make Krsna accessible by being Krsna conscious. That's how Krsna becomes accessible. The more Krsna conscious we are, the more people can make a connection with Krsna. We don't make Krsna accessible by packaging Him in a way that people can't see who Krsna is. We make Krsna accessible by the way Prabhupada made Krsna accessible. He spoke only about Krsna. That's how Krsna became accessible. And he lived only for Krsna. That made Krsna even more accessible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo why shouldn't we make Prabhupada accessible also? We should make him accessible by making sure that everybody has an opportunity to receive his books. Everybody should know what his example is. And everybody should know what his mission is. Krsna. Nothing more, nothing less. The lotus feet of Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen you have the lotus feet of Krsna, you have everything. Prabhupada says, yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati. (Mundaka Upanisad 1.3) When you have Krsna, you have everything. That's his mission.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore there's nothing more than Krsna because there is nobody equal to Him and nobody is greater than Him. Krsna is the last stop, the param gatih, the final goal. And we have to establish that goal in the minds of everyone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada therefore emphasized that there is nothing more than Krsna. And he would never give anything less than Krsna. Uncompromising. Nothing less. That was his compassion. That was his kindness to humanity. Anyone who came in contact with him could feel his compassion. Simply seeing him, tears would come to people's eyes because he was so filled with compassion. Prabhupada would cry, simply to think how people were trying to forget Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA devotee once told me a story about Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada was in a car with devotees, driving by a golf course. When he saw the golfers he asked, \"What are they doing?\" He had never seen or heard of golf before. The devotee replied, \"Prabhupada, that's called golf.\" Prabhupada asked, \"What is this golf?\" The devotee said, \"You see that stick there they are holding? They walk around all day and push a little white ball into a hole.\" Prabhupada started to cry, big tears. \"They are doing so much to try to forget Krsna.\" Crying. Para dukha dukhi. That is a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava has that feeling in his heart. He has his connection with Krsna and therefore has everything he needs. He has service to Krsna. There's a purpose for living for him. There's a purpose for everything he does… for eating, for breathing. He never hankers. He's satisfied in any condition of life. And because he does not suffer, he can feel other's suffering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this way a person who is self-satisfied and freed from envy can think of others' welfare. Therefore when he sees others forgetting Krsna, he cries. He feels the pain that they won't be happy until they are connected with Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat's what drove Prabhupada to expand the Krsna consciousness movement in the way he did within twelve years. He was sleeping two hours a night and waking up at midnight. He was translating Srimad Bhagavatam until four o'clock in the morning. He would then begin his day, go for his morning walk, give Srimad Bhagavatam class. Even during his morning walk he was preaching to his disciples. Then he would meet people. Everything he did, he did with the burning desire to give Krsna to others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe need that example. It gives us impetus. We should think, \"What am I doing with my life? Let me use whatever strength, whatever wealth, whatever intelligence I have to do something for Prabhupada's mission. I cannot be a miser and waste this life.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada is driving us to understand that principle. And if we don't remember Prabhupada and remember his example, we'll so easily forget. We'll think his mission is to become comfortable in life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada didn't teach that, because he never looked for his own comfort. He never tried. Comfort was offered but he was not interested. He taught how to use all of our energy for spreading Krsna consciousness. He never asked for his own comfort.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes devotees would give comforts to him. We gave a lecture on Sunday explaining why Prabhupada would sometimes accept it. He accepted only out of compassion. Not because he was interested in his own comfort. He accepted it because he wanted to reciprocate the love of his disciples and take that love and place it to Krsna's lotus feet. But he would never ask for his own comfort. His example was to not be interested in one's own personal comfort. His comfort was giving Krsna to others. That was comfort for his heart because he felt he was using his energy for the highest purpose.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada concludes this commentary with that point. He says. \"Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogi interested only in his personal elevation. The yogi who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward Krsna consciousness.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is what's in Srila Prabhupada's purport. When we read Srila Prabhupada's commentaries, these are the realizations we should be getting. He called his commentaries his personal ecstasies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada was even one time sitting and reading his own book. When the Fifth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam was brought to him, Prabhupada immediately opened it and began reading it. Devotees said, Prabhupada even you read your own books.\" And Prabhupada said, \"Oh yes. I have not written these books. Krsna has written these books. That's why I am reading them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is Prabhupada. Krsna on every page.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo this is our understanding of this verse:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada knows how to make others really happy and he knows what the cause of distress is. Just one very simple point. We've simply forgotten Krsna. That is the source of distress.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada used to quote Srila Bhaktisiddhanta. He said that there is nothing lacking in this material world. Everything is available except one thing… Krsna consciousness. \"Therefore,\" he said, \"I have come to give to Him to you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n",

The cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And the cause of happiness is knowing Krsna to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being, the proprietor of all lands and planets, and the sincerest friend of all living entities. The perfect yogi knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with Krsna. And because one in Krsna consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of Krsna everywhere. Since the perfect yogi tries to broadcast the importance of becoming Krsna conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah (Bg. 18.69). In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is the best yogi because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogi interested only in his personal elevation. The yogi who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward Krsna consciousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI've been finding myself talking a lot about Srila Prabhupada recently. My desire to speak more about him was probably stimulated this year in Mayapura when I read a booklet produced by a committee of our GBC body about Srila Prabhupada's position as the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON. Essentially it was just a wonderful book that established, very conclusively, the meaning of \"Founder-Acarya… not only based upon Srila Prabhupada's position in ISKCON but also based upon the position of \"Founder-Acarya\" in our sampradaya.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was very enlivened after reading this booklet. I read it one day when I was sick and was unable to attend the meetings. It deepened my conviction about the importance of preserving Srila Prabhupada's presence within the International Society for Krsna consciousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe word \"Acarya\" in Founder-Acarya means that Srila Prabhupada is the ultimate teacher by his own example in ISKCON. Being a perfect teacher by example, therefore, everything he does is instructive because, as followers, we are meant to aspire to strictly follow his example.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada would oftentimes speak about the difference between following in the footsteps and imitating. He would say that following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas means that we follow the same path they themselves walked. It also means to follow their instructions. Therefore, mahajano yena gatah sa panthah....they leave behind instructions by which their followers can traverse the same path as they themselves also traversed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tImitating means that we try to artificially imitate the position of being fully realized without being fully realized.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada would oftentimes quote the verse,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tyad yad acarati sresthas<br />\n\ttat tad evetaro janah<br />\n\tsa yat pramanam kurute<br />\n\tlokas tad anuvartate\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTRANSLATION<br />\n\tWhatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is Krsna's instruction in Bhagavad-gita. He explains why He had to also teach by setting an example because if He didn't then the whole world would be put to ruination.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada's instructions were so potent because he did what he was preaching. In English, we have an expression, I don't know if there is a comparable one in Russian, \"He walks his talk.\" In other words, his actions are fully consistent with his words. Because he was so elevated, he would sometimes give an instruction which would seem almost impossible to follow. But his example was always there as the extra strength for us to try.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe all experienced that during Srila Prabhupada's manifest presence in our Krsna consciousness movement. Srila Prabhupada was inspiring his followers to become ghostianandis, to preach Krsna consciousness, and not to become concerned simply about one's own enlightenment. There was an overwhelming emphasis on spreading Krsna consciousness and there was an enthusiasm to do so because we always had his example. We may not be Krsna conscious, but we could always preach boldly and strongly that it exists because we could always point to Prabhupada.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn one sense it was very simple in those early years because Prabhupada was not only our Founder-Acarya, but he was the only guru. When someone became qualified for initiation, they knew who they were going to be initiated by and who they were going to serve. That gave Srila Prabhupada's followers great strength and conviction to preach his message. We felt Prabhupada was therefore us and was carefully watching to make sure we didn't deviate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said, \"Don't change the message. Keep it intact.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI remember one lecture when Srila Prabhupada found something in the transcription he was reading which was different from that which he dictated. He became very disturbed. In the lecture Prabhupada said, \"Don't be overintelligent.\" Don't think that you know more or you know better than your spiritual master.\" He said, \"Your potency will be in your ability to simply repeat what I have given to you.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we could repeat everything that Prabhupada told us and we always had the full confidence and support that the example was there for others to see. This gave us great strength to preach, and to preach boldly, because Srila Prabhupada always emphasized to preach boldly.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe told us to \"Boil the milk and make it thicker.\" In other words, don't compromise. Don't water Krsna consciousness down to something it isn't. Krsna is already all-attractive. Don't ever water Krsna consciousness down.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was telling a story to a group of devotees in Kaliningrad the other day. I was remembering one conversation that Srila Prabhupada had... I can't remember what year it was. I think it might have been 1975.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe was visited by one well-known yogi at that time. His name was Yogi Bhajan. I never met Yogi Bhajan but in 1971, I was living with a group of people who were his followers. It was before I read Srila Prabhupada's Bhagavad-gita. They used to speak a lot about him to me. But I had no particular appeal or attraction to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyway, Prabhupada was visited by this yogi along with two of his secretaries. He came to invite Srila Prabhupada to a conference called the \"Unity of Man\" conference. He was promoting himself as the organizer of the conference and he was inviting and also visiting popular yogis, mystics, saints, and sadhus to extend invitations. He was promoting this conference as if it would benefit all of humanity. So he said, \"We want you to come, Swamiji. Please come and we'll give you a slot and you can speak. Become part of our united effort to save the world.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada tried to explain to him that there's only one way that humanity can be united. He said, \"We can only be united if we surrender to Krsna.\" So he asked, \"Therefore Bhagavad-gita will be preached and Krsna's message will be preached exclusively at the conference?\" And then Yogi Bhajan said, \"Yes. That will be there. But there will be many other sages, mystics and saints and they will give their teachings. In this way we can all be united in harmony, with the same goal.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada said, \"No. There's only one goal. Krsna's goal. We have to follow Krsna otherwise how can we become united?\" Prabhupada used the example about the United Nations. He would say that the United Nations means that even though many countries come together, they have their own flag and they represent their own interests. They are mainly interested in their own interests. That's all. So he said that United Nations simply means that there are more flags. Therefore United Nations simply means that we add more flags but there's no real unity because everyone is simply representing their own interests. They want to make sure that their own interests are being secured.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he was expressing this same point to Yogi Bhajan, that actually there is only one interest… Krsna's interest. So he explained why he didn't want to attend. He said, \"You can have your conference but I will not attend.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Yogi Bhajan was a little persistent because he felt that if Prabhupada attended more people would come. Prabhupada didn't want to be used that way. Yogi Bhajan really tried to make it look really nice, \"If you come, it will be so nice, so wonderful, it will be a real good example for the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYogi Bhajan's secretaries were sitting and taking notes. Prabhupada was noticing this as he was speaking. So Prabhupada just turned to Yogi Bhajan and said, \"Write this down in your notebook. Bhaktivedanta Swami says that without Krsna, there will be no unity. Put that in your notebook. Make sure that you write it down.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYoga Bhajan tried one more time by explaining how it would be such a wonderful experience. Prabhupada finished the whole conversation by making one statement. He says, \"If you go into the latrine and you throw scented water on stool, does that make it a nice place?\" Prabhupada was trying to explain, \"That's what you are trying to do. You are trying to make everything a nice place, but without Krsna you cannot make this a nice place.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt that particular point, one of the people accompanying him got a little incensed, so they got up and they left. Prabhupada simply laughed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSomeone may say, \"Why didn't Prabhupada take the opportunity to preach at the event?\" Because  he didn't want to compromise Krsna consciousness. He was an uncompromised example of Krsna consciousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is another story I like about Prabhupada and his bold preaching.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada was invited in Jagannath Puri to inaugurate a book that one local author had written. Many famous people were there to do the inauguration. So Prabhupada saw this as a very good opportunity to preach boldly because he was very disturbed that his disciples were not being allowed to take darshan of Lord Jagannath. He therefore accepted the invitation although the organizers didn't know that was Prabhupada's intention. The organizers arranged for all the other invited guests to speak about the book first and then Prabhupada was to speak last. So one by one each dignitary came and spoke about the author's book, glorified him, and said things about the book. Prabhupada was then invited to speak.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada immediately began speaking how Lord Jagannath is the Lord of the universe. He's not just Lord of the Hindus, not just Lord of the Indians. He's the Lord of universe. And because He's the Lord of the universe that means that everyone has a relationship with Lord Jagannath. He gave a very powerful talk about the Lord's position, quoting Bhagavad-gita, aham bija-pradah pita.... Krsna says, \"I am the seed-giving father of all living beings.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he was challenging, \"Why are you not allowing Vaisnavas to take darshan of Lord Jagannath?\" He spoke for some time and the organizers were starting to get a little anxious. They were standing on the side and were saying, \"Swamiji, the book. Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada didn't even look at them. He continued like fire. \"Swamiji, Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada just waited until he finished his message. He then looked up at them and they said, \"Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada picked up the book and said, \"Oh yes. This book is inaugurated\" and then he threw it on the table and walked off the stage.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFinished. So bold. He was so bold. He could be bold. Of course Prabhupada even sometimes said to us, he said, \"I can do this because I'm an old man. Don't imitate. Because he would be that way and people would still respect him and listen to him. He would caution us though. He wanted us to preach boldly but to be careful to not imitate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada was also a gentleman. He would not publicly criticize. Even when people would ask Prabhupada, for example, if they would ask, \"Can you tell me? What is your opinion of Yogi Bhajan?\" And Prabhupada would say, \"What is his philosophy?\" So he would make the person explain what is the philosophy of Yogi Bhajan. I'm using him just as a hypothetical example. But he did it with many people because people would sometimes ask Prabhupada's opinion about... at that time there was a lot... for instance there was Krsnamurti, who was very popular, Guru Maharaji, the so-called \"perfect master\". Then there were so many gods around too. Prabhupada also had to deal with questions about all of these gods. So Prabhupada would ask, \"What is his philosophy?\" Upon hearing the philosophy he would then rip it to pieces. He would expose the impersonal conclusion or whatever misrepresantation of the absolute truth that it was. But he would not openly criticize the individual.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe did this a lot with Vivekananda. Although he would not go out of his way to criticize publicly, but he would definitely do it in private conversations and lectures with disciples. If he was asked publicly he would have to defend Krsna. He was always defending Krsna. He was always defending the sampradaya.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne time Prabhupada was sitting in a room with Indian people… I think it was in Bombay. One gentleman was challenging Prabhupada because Prabhupada was using strong words. I think he might have been using \"rascals\" or \"mudhas\". And the man was saying, \"Swamiji, you are supposed to be sama darsinah. Why are you speaking like this?\" Prabhupada replied, \"Oh, sama darsinah? That is a higher platform. I'm not on that platform. I have to discriminate. But I discriminate because I see who is following Krsna's instructions and who is not following Krsna's instructions. And Krsna says, \"avajananti mam mudha\", He says \"na mam duskritino mudha\". He gave examples how Krsna used strong language, \"mudha\". \"So therefore I simply present what Krsna says. I have to discriminate, who follows and who doesn't follow. But I give Krsna's instructions to everyone. In this sense I don't discriminate. This is my sama darsinah. I tell everyone what Krsna says, indiscriminately.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then the man said, \"But Swamiji, what do you do? You are simply repeating what somebody else said. What are you doing?\" Of course, this is Prabhupada's whole mission. Bhagavad-gita AS IT IS. That was his whole mission. His mission was to give Krsna's instruction as Krsna gave it. Therefore he was presenting Krsna's words, explaining what Krsna's words were and then he was teaching by his own example how he would surrender to Krsna's words. Therefore Prabhupada's words had so much potency to change people because he didn't compromise. He gave Krsna's words and he taught by his example, being fully surrendered to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHere was an example of somebody who gave Krsna's instructions and then pushed everybody beyond their own self-imposed limits, whoever was sincere enough and could understand that, \"Yes, he's following. I have to follow too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada would never compromise. That was his compassion. Some people may say, \"Oh, it looks like arrogance. Why wouldn't he compromise for people?\" But that was his compassion. Atmaupamyena sarvatra. That's exactly what this verse is about in Bhagavad-gita.\"He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!\" His compassion was that, \"They can only be saved if they take shelter at Krsna's lotus feet. How can I give anything else? Anything else would be violence.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was his compassion because he was fully realized in what is real happiness, and because he saw all living entities as parts and parcels of Krsna, he knew that the only thing that could make them happy is to connect them to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIsopanisad says, \"One who always sees all living entities as spiritual sparks, in quality one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of things. What, then, can be illusion or anxiety for him?\" Srila Prabhupada was never experiencing any material anxiety. He had only one anxiety and that was the sufferings of others. That was his anxiety. Why? Because he was satisfied. He had his connection with Krsna and therefore he didn't need anything from anyone for himself. Thus, he could give Krsna unlimitedly to everyone without compromising.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore he was a perfect yogi who could see why others were suffering. He knew their source of suffering, as he says right here in this commentary, \"the cause of distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God.\" Prabhupada went right to the root cause.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSomeone may say, \"Well, there's so many other causes of distress. I could make a big, long list.\" But Prabhupada would go right to the root— forgetfulness of one's relationship with God— because as soon as one establishes a connection with the Supreme Lord… no more birth, no more death. Moreover, whatever distress they may experience in this life is just burning up whatever reactions were left from previous lives, thus finishing their connection with the material world. Isn't that compassion? He felt that kind of compassion and that's why he was so uncompromising. \"How can I give them anything less than Krsna?\" That was his love. That was his equality. That was his kindness.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he gave Krsna uncompromisingly, and he was very careful to preserve that same method of distribution for the future. He therefore taught his followers to give Krsna to others. And he also expected his followers for future generations to preserve his teachings and this example.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo even though we may not be fully Krsna conscious, we still have to know what is the goal— the example that we want to come to ourselves? We cannot imitate complete Krsna consciousness. But at least we must try to come to that platform. And even though we cannot imitate Srila Prabhupada's perfect, Krsna conscious vision of the world, we must keep his method of preaching intact by preserving what he's given to us in its most potent form— in his books— without imposing any of our own interpretation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery page of Bhagavad-gita as it is pure devotional service. Every page of Srimad Bhagavatam is pure devotional service. It's not anything else. It's pure devotional service... beginning, middle and end. Therefore those who are true followers of Srila Prabhupada will keep his message intact. We still have his example. We can still talk about it. We can still remember that example. We should know what that example is. Everyone should know Srila Prabhupada. If you don't know Srila Prabhupada, you're losing. He's the perfect example. Otherwise, how do we know what platform to aspire for unless we have the perfect example? If we don't know, we'll start thinking, \"Oh I could be like this, I could be like that.\" No. He's our Founder-Acarya for all time— not just for twelve years while he was present on the planet. He's the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON for as long as ISKCON is present.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada was very, very strong on this point. Whenever he saw the slightest discrepancy in being presented without the title \"Founder-Acarya\", he would immediately correct it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne time Srila Prabhupada came to the new BBT headquarters in Los Angeles and in the front there was a sign, \"Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.\" Prabhupada said, \"Where is Founder-Acarya? Why is it not there?\" Devotees were shocked. He wanted to make sure that \"Founder-Acarya\" was on everything. Why? Someone may think it was vanity. No. There was never any pride in Prabhupada. It was his compassion. He wanted to make sure his vision prevailed for the Krsna consciousness movement. Therefore Founder-Acarya had to be everywhere because he wanted to ensure that everyone would be led to Krsna's lotus feet. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is the mission we experienced in his presence. We'd bring everyone to Prabhupada's lotus feet because we were confident he was connecting them to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we need that example. Yes. The goal is to find shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna, and the example of how to find shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna is in our Founder-Acarya.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada's books are the foundation of the Krsna consciousness movement. Nobody else's books are as important as Prabhupada's books. When people come to our temples they should immediately see only Prabhupada's books... a grand display. We should be eager, excited, ecstatic, to introduce people to Srila Prabhupada's books.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada's books change lives… not just during his manifest presence. They are still changing lives and will continue to change lives. There's so many stories about how people's lives have been changed by coming in contact with Prabhupada in his books.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI like to tell this story. It's a wonderful story. Quite some time back, I was visiting the temple in Montreal. During the visit, I was writing my Vyasa Puja offering to Srila Prabhupada. Usually we have a deadline in order for it to be published in the annual Vyasa Puja book and the deadline was the next day.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I was sitting in my room about to begin writing my Vyasa Puja offering. What oftentimes happens, however, whenever it comes to write a Vyasa Puja offering, I sit there and I go blank for a little while, thinking about what I am going to write. So I was just sitting, looking at the screen thinking, \"Where to start?\" Starting is usually the hardest part. Once I'm started I can get going.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of a sudden there was a knock on the door. It was the Temple President. He said, \"Maharaja, there's a gentleman who came to the temple and there's nobody here. Would you take a little time to talk to him and answer his questions?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I said, \"You know. I have one hour right now. And I need this one hour to write my offering in time for the deadline tomorrow. So he said, \"He's probably got just a few questions. I'm sure it won't be very long.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I agreed. I went into the temple reception area and there was one man, probably in his 60's. He introduced himself and asked if we could sit down. So I shook his hand and sat down.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe then just started talking. \"Do you know that I was the caption of Montreal police back in 1973?\" It might have been 1974. I can't remember exactly the year he told me. \"I was at the airport when your Prabhupada came. I saw him, I looked at him and I could see that here's a very saintly person. For what I know right now about him, I wish I would have just given everything up right then and there and became his disciple.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I said, \"Really? How is it that you know more now?\" He then reached in his pocket and pulled out a pocket-sized Bhagavad-gita. This Bhagavad-gita looked like it had been really read a lot. He said, \"You see this Bhagavad-gita? I've read it thirty-two times.\" I said, \"Thirty-two times?\" He said, \"Yes. Thirty-two times and still counting. I don't go anywhere without it. I read it every day. Sometimes I take my wife to the shopping mall and she says, 'I may be awhile and you'll have to wait.' and I say, 'No problem. I've got my Bhagavad-gita. Take as long as you want.' In fact, my wife is shopping right now. But I saw that the temple was so close by that I decided to come. I could read Bhagavad-gita again and again and it's always fresh.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe then opened the Bhagavad-gita and started reading verses from it, and then he started talking again about Prabhupada. \"He was such a beautiful person. I don't know why I did not become his disciple.\" He started to tell everything that he saw at the airport.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe went on talking and talking and I was thinking, \"I thought that I was going to answer some questions but there are no questions being asked. He just wants to talk.\" So I just sat there and was just mystified listening to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of a sudden he said, \"Oh, I think my wife is probably ready by now.\" He had been talking for about forty-five minutes mostly about Prabhupada. He got up, went to the door and started to say good-bye. Then he said, \"You know, my wife and I read Prabhupada Lilamrita every night together. She won't read Bhagavad-gita. But I can get her to read Prabhupada Lilamrita. And every night we read about Prabhupada. He then started telling me the latest story he read from Prabhupada Lilamrta.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis went on for about another ten to fifteen minutes as he stood by the door with his hand on door knob and the door half-opened. Then he said, \"I really have to go now. It's been nice talking with you\", and he left.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI probably didn't say more than five words. I looked at my watch and one hour passed. I was thinking, \"Oh no. I lost my one hour!\" I had a program coming up and therefore lost the hour I was hoping to use for writing my Vyasa Puja offering.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it turned out, the next morning I sat down and just wrote the whole story about my meeting with the former Captain, and that was my Vyasa Puja offering. I saw how Krsna just sent him to write my Vyasa Puja offering for me because I couldn't come up with anything myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyway, my realization is that Prabhupada is still changing lives. That man was so attached to Prabhupada. It seemed to me that the gateway to the spiritual world will be open to him for the attachment he has to Krsna's pure devotee.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI could tell so many other stories but the point is that it's so important to make Srila Prabhupada's books available to people. People are hankering to know someone like Prabhupada and we have a responsibility, as his followers, to make sure that Prabhupada is always accessible to everyone. We should be carefrul to never eclipse Srila Prabhupada.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor instance how do we make Krsna accessible? We make Krsna accessible by being Krsna conscious. That's how Krsna becomes accessible. The more Krsna conscious we are, the more people can make a connection with Krsna. We don't make Krsna accessible by packaging Him in a way that people can't see who Krsna is. We make Krsna accessible by the way Prabhupada made Krsna accessible. He spoke only about Krsna. That's how Krsna became accessible. And he lived only for Krsna. That made Krsna even more accessible.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo why shouldn't we make Prabhupada accessible also? We should make him accessible by making sure that everybody has an opportunity to receive his books. Everybody should know what his example is. And everybody should know what his mission is. Krsna. Nothing more, nothing less. The lotus feet of Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you have the lotus feet of Krsna, you have everything. Prabhupada says, yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati. (Mundaka Upanisad 1.3) When you have Krsna, you have everything. That's his mission.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore there's nothing more than Krsna because there is nobody equal to Him and nobody is greater than Him. Krsna is the last stop, the param gatih, the final goal. And we have to establish that goal in the minds of everyone.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada therefore emphasized that there is nothing more than Krsna. And he would never give anything less than Krsna. Uncompromising. Nothing less. That was his compassion. That was his kindness to humanity. Anyone who came in contact with him could feel his compassion. Simply seeing him, tears would come to people's eyes because he was so filled with compassion. Prabhupada would cry, simply to think how people were trying to forget Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA devotee once told me a story about Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada was in a car with devotees, driving by a golf course. When he saw the golfers he asked, \"What are they doing?\" He had never seen or heard of golf before. The devotee replied, \"Prabhupada, that's called golf.\" Prabhupada asked, \"What is this golf?\" The devotee said, \"You see that stick there they are holding? They walk around all day and push a little white ball into a hole.\" Prabhupada started to cry, big tears. \"They are doing so much to try to forget Krsna.\" Crying. Para dukha dukhi. That is a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava has that feeling in his heart. He has his connection with Krsna and therefore has everything he needs. He has service to Krsna. There's a purpose for living for him. There's a purpose for everything he does… for eating, for breathing. He never hankers. He's satisfied in any condition of life. And because he does not suffer, he can feel other's suffering.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this way a person who is self-satisfied and freed from envy can think of others' welfare. Therefore when he sees others forgetting Krsna, he cries. He feels the pain that they won't be happy until they are connected with Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat's what drove Prabhupada to expand the Krsna consciousness movement in the way he did within twelve years. He was sleeping two hours a night and waking up at midnight. He was translating Srimad Bhagavatam until four o'clock in the morning. He would then begin his day, go for his morning walk, give Srimad Bhagavatam class. Even during his morning walk he was preaching to his disciples. Then he would meet people. Everything he did, he did with the burning desire to give Krsna to others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe need that example. It gives us impetus. We should think, \"What am I doing with my life? Let me use whatever strength, whatever wealth, whatever intelligence I have to do something for Prabhupada's mission. I cannot be a miser and waste this life.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada is driving us to understand that principle. And if we don't remember Prabhupada and remember his example, we'll so easily forget. We'll think his mission is to become comfortable in life.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada didn't teach that, because he never looked for his own comfort. He never tried. Comfort was offered but he was not interested. He taught how to use all of our energy for spreading Krsna consciousness. He never asked for his own comfort.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes devotees would give comforts to him. We gave a lecture on Sunday explaining why Prabhupada would sometimes accept it. He accepted only out of compassion. Not because he was interested in his own comfort. He accepted it because he wanted to reciprocate the love of his disciples and take that love and place it to Krsna's lotus feet. But he would never ask for his own comfort. His example was to not be interested in one's own personal comfort. His comfort was giving Krsna to others. That was comfort for his heart because he felt he was using his energy for the highest purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada concludes this commentary with that point. He says. \"Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogi interested only in his personal elevation. The yogi who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward Krsna consciousness.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is what's in Srila Prabhupada's purport. When we read Srila Prabhupada's commentaries, these are the realizations we should be getting. He called his commentaries his personal ecstasies.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada was even one time sitting and reading his own book. When the Fifth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam was brought to him, Prabhupada immediately opened it and began reading it. Devotees said, Prabhupada even you read your own books.\" And Prabhupada said, \"Oh yes. I have not written these books. Krsna has written these books. That's why I am reading them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is Prabhupada. Krsna on every page.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is our understanding of this verse:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada knows how to make others really happy and he knows what the cause of distress is. Just one very simple point. We've simply forgotten Krsna. That is the source of distress.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada used to quote Srila Bhaktisiddhanta. He said that there is nothing lacking in this material world. Everything is available except one thing… Krsna consciousness. \"Therefore,\" he said, \"I have come to give to Him to you.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna.\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tLast night we had a wonderful program in Istanbul. Even though the local devotees are not able to go out on harinamas or propagate too visibly in the public here in Turkey, they have found other means through the internet to advertise their programs.

A few had attended only one or two programs before.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was very enlivened to have the opportunity to introduce new people to Krsna consciousness in a country where Krsna consciousness is still being pioneered. It reminded me of the days when I first started lecturing in the former Soviet Union. The devotees here have to be careful about how they propagate Krsna consciousness. Although the government is not aggresively hostile, still, it is not so disposed toward anything which is not Islamic. Much of what the devotees are doing here, therefore, has to be presented under the banner of yoga. And even then, as I was told by the local leader, Nrsimha Krsna dasa, there is currently a significant push among top-level sections of the government to ban the teaching of any form of yoga which does not focus exclusively on the physical benefits of yoga.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately last night's talk was not recorded by anyone so I have no audio file to provide for the site. In summary, I simply took the opportunity to explain in detail the social setting as it was in America in the mid 1960's and early 1970's and how Srila Prabhupada was able to capture an attentive audience from among the hippies because they, more than anyone else, were looking for an alternative way to live. I then talked about the reasons why people, by nature, are keen on finding alternatives to the way they live, but more often than not, by a lack of a choice, most will surrender and try to make the best of a compromised way of living having found no positive alternative.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSomehow this topic seemed to capture the attention of the audience. I therefore took advantage of their attentiveness to explain how Srila Prabhupada was able to give us the positive alternative by convincing us to accept authority, despite our deep-seated inclination to reject all kinds of authority. \"Rejection of authority\" seemed to be another topic which resonated with most, especially the new people who were in attendance. I therefore then explained how Srila Prabhupada was able to \"tip the scales\" so to speak, to the side of submission, by convincing us to accept his authority without forcing it upon us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI then explained how Srila Prabhupada forced us to surrender to him mainly by his example. In Srila Prabhupada, we could see someone who was compassionate, kind, detached, selfless, and able to be satisfied in any condition of life. Without that example, we would have not been able to surrender to him in the way that we did. We wanted so much to please him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI then explained how Sanatana Goswami glorified Haridasa Thakur by saying that some people preach but don't behave properly, and some people behave properly but do not preach, Haridasa Thakur performed both perfectly and was thus able to be the spiritual master for the entire world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI then took the opportunity of speaking about Haridasa Thakur by telling the whole story of Haridasa Thakura's conversion of the prostitute who was sent by Ramacandra Khan to allure him into an illicit connection with her and how he was able to convert her by his example of complete absorption in the Holy Name. We emphasized the point that Haridasa fully knew the reason why the prostitute was sent to him, but tolerated her visits for three consecutive days simply to show his compassion upon her. By the power of Srila Haridasa Thakur's example in pure Krsna consciousness, even a prostitute was able to become a revered Vaisnavi and was able to teach the whole world by her example as well of the importance of chanting the Holy Name.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then returned our focus upon Srila Prabhupada and spent the rest of the talk detailing how he changed our lives, and continues to change the lives of anyone who comes in contact with him through his books, his teachings, and everything he left behind for many generations to come.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe kirtan after the talk was so uplifting. Everyone, without exception, was loudly chanting Krsna's holy names. I could have gone on forever, but it was a weeknight and people had to return home in order to be able to get up for work the next day. We therefore stopped by 9:30 PM, I distributed prasadam, and I then answered questions for another half-hour. Nrsimha Krsna, his wife, and I came back from the program very happy to see how many new people were chanting so enthusiastically. Nrsimha Krsna told me that after the program, some of the new guests even asked if they would be allowed to come again for tonight's program, fearing that their presence might be an imposition. So let's see what tonight will bring.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNrsimha Krsna took a few pictures and shared them with me. They will be posted in the photo section.

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThis morning on my flight from Mumbai to Istanbul, I decided to transcribe and partially edit the talk I gave yesterday to the brahmacaris in Chowpatty. I felt that the topic they asked me to speak on was very relevant, not only now, but for the future as well. Another reason is that I also wanted to avoid sleeping on the flight and thought doing something like this would keep me awake. So here is the partially edited transcript I worked on today.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tSo, I was just now given the topic to speak about… \"Loyalty to the parampara.\" It reminded me of a section in Sri Bhaktyaloka where Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur gives a nice explanation about the importance of following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas. He explains the dangers of not following, the consequences of not following, and the reasons why someone may not follow. So I'm thinking it might be good to read from there. Probably all I have to do is read it because it gives sufficient detail without any need for comment. But we can try to expand on the points he's made and I'm sure that Maharaja will have some comments to share too. Since we have an hour, we can also have a little discussion on the topic. Let's see if we can all benefit from it. So this is in the section entitled \"tat-tat-karma-pravartanat.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tIt's not in sadhu-vritti?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tNot in Sadhu Vritti, interestingly enough. You would think it would be there, but it's actually in the section of tat-tat-karma-pravartanat. Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur explains what are the favorable activities for devotional service and he lists the first five, which are 1) accepting a bona fide spiritual master, 2) inquiring from him, 3) taking initiation from him, 4) serving him, and then 5) following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas. So he elaborates on that within the context of those activities which are favorable for devotional service.&nbsp; So I will read. I think this is the relevant part here…about receiving instructions from the spiritual master. He says: \"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should follow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh<br />\r\n\tpanthah santapa-varjitah<br />\r\n\tanavapta-sramam purve<br />\r\n\tyena santah pratasthire\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That path bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat's the translation of that verse.\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and satisfaction. When we discuss the path of devotional service exhibited by Sri Rupa, Sri Sanatana, Sri Raghunatha, and Sri Haridasa Thakura, then we feel such happiness that it cannot be described. When the miscreant Mohammedans tortured Haridasa Thakura, he said:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tkhanda khanda hai' deha yaya yadi prana<br />\r\n\ttabu ami vadane na chadi hari-nama<br />\r\n\te saba jivere krsna! karaha prasada<br />\r\n\tmora drohe nahu e sabara aparadha\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven if my body is cut into pieces and I loose my life, I will never give up chanting the Lord's holy name. O Krsna, please be merciful upon these poor souls, kindly excuse them for their offense of torturing me.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe're almost the end of this section. I will summarize it shortly. \"Maintaining this type of determination and being compassionate to all living entities while always chanting the holy name of Krsna is the path of devotional service exhibited by the previous mahajanas.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt gives the path. Three things. Can anyone repeat without me having to repeat? What were the three things?&nbsp; Yes. Determination for devotional service, which was? Compassion towards others. Yes. That's the second. And, yes, the holy name. While always chanting the holy name. This was the path of devotional service exhibited by the previous mahajanas. So how did Haridas Thakur manifest that? We just quoted. What did he say? Yes. Correct. He said, \"You can cut my body to pieces and I'll never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" What else did he say? Yes. \"Kindly excuse them.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tAll three of them are right there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tYes. All three of them are right there. So that's the path. Continuing in Sri Bhaktyaloka…\"A path cannot be manufactured. Whatever path is there should be accepted by sadhus. Those who are proud and want fame try vigorously to discover new paths. Those who have good fortune from past lives give up pride and respect the established path. Those who are unfortunate promenade on a new path and thus cheat the world. Regarding such persons the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.46-47) quotes the Brahma-yamala as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsruti-smrti-puranadi-<br />\r\n\tpancaratra-vidhim vina<br />\r\n\taikantiki harer bhaktir<br />\r\n\tutpatayaiva kalpate<br />\r\n\tbhaktir aikantikiveyam<br />\r\n\tavicarat pratiyate<br />\r\n\tvastu tastu tatha naiva<br />\r\n\tyad asastriyateksyate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, Puranas, and Narada Pancaratra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society. Such activities are born out of speculation and therefore they only superficially resemble unalloyed devotion because they are disrespectful to the Vedic injunctions. Disrespecting Vedic injunctions falls in the category of atheism. Whenever there is disrespect for the scriptures, which are the Lord's instructions, that cannot be devotional service.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is one section. There is more and it comes a little bit later. But here Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur is explaining a very important point, that these three principles are the path which has been established by the previous mahajanas… compassion, determination, and constantly chanting the holy name of the Lord. In other words, this is the path given by our previous acaryas. It's the path that all of our previous acaryas followed themselves…constant determination, chanting of the holy name of the Lord, and compassion. And those who deviate from that path, as described here, do so because of pride.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt reminds me of a conversation I oftentimes refer to, which was described by Giriraja Maharaja in Satsvarupa Maharaja's \"Prabhupada Lila.\" He told a story about one Indian man, who spoke out when Prabhupada was having a room conversation. I can't remember where it was. But I'm thinking that it must have been in Bombay. One man was challenging Prabhupada, saying that Prabhupada was being too critical. He said something like, \"Swamiji, why are you speaking so harshly. This is not sama darsinah.\" He was quoting the verse from the Bhagavad-gita, how a humble sage by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision, \"panditah sama darsinah.\" He said, \"You are using such strong language.\" I guess Prabhupada was using, as he oftentimes uses, the word \"rascal\", and the man was challenging Prabhupada, \"Why are you speaking so strongly. You should be equal to everyone.\" And Prabhupada was explaining that, \"Actually, these are not my words, they are Krsna's words. Krsna says, \"na mam duskritino mudha.\" He said, \"I am simply repeating Krsna's words.\" He also said, \"panditah sama darsinah is a very high position. I am not on that position. I have to discriminate. I have to see who is following what Krsna says and who is not following what Krsna says. That is my panditah sama darsinah. I don't discriminate. I give those instructions to everybody. And therefore, those who don't follow Krsna's instructions, Krsna says, 'you are a mudha.' So that's my equal vision. I give Krsna's instructions to everyone indiscriminately and either you are following what Krsna says or you are not following what Krsna says.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe man then further challenged Prabhupada. He said, \"But Swamiji, but what are you doing? All you are doing is just quoting somebody else. Why don't you speak for yourself? And then Prabhupada got very strong with him and he said, \"No. This is our system. We stand solidly on the strength of the words spoken by Krsna in our disciplic succesion. This is my duty. This is my qualification. I do not deviate. We stand on this position firmly. That is our qualification. To repeat what Krsna says.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI think Giriraja Maharaja was also quoted in the story he told, at least the way it was quoted in the \"Prabhupada Lila,\" that after the gathering, while everyone was walking out of the room, the man was heard saying to himself, \"Very interesting. The Swamiji is \"sama darsinah.\"You could say how Prabhupada was not discriminating. He was giving everyone what Krsna said without discrimination. And when Krsna says, \"You are a rascal, then you are a rascal. \"Krsna gives the criteria, therefore I do not discriminate.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tavajananti mam mudha<br />\r\n\tmanusim tanum asritam<br />\r\n\tparam bhavam ajananto<br />\r\n\tmama bhuta-mahesvaram (BG 9.11)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo therefore our position is to always defend the parampara. In fact there is that well-known story when Vallabha Bhatta came to Lord Caitanya and asked him to hear his commentary on Srimad Bhagavatam. And as we know, nobody else would hear it. He was very frustrated. Nobody would listen to it. Of course, Lord Caitanya didn't give him any credibility. He explained the reason was because he did not accept the words of Sridhar Swami. Vallabha Bhatta thought his commentaries surpassed those of Sridhar Swami. Therefore Lord Caitanya said that, \"One who does not accept the swami [husband] as an authority, is a prostitute.\" And therefore he criticized Vallabha Bhatta for thinking he could surpass Sridhar Swami's commentaries, by presenting something better.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo of course, it is always the duty of the spiritual master to present the commentaries of the disciplic succession. If there appears to be discrepancies, he tries to show that there are no discrepancies at all. If he cannot show that there are no discrepancies, then he lets the statements of the acaryas stand by themselves. He doesn't try to impose an interpretation which is does not properly represent the conclusions of the previous acaryas. Therefore here it is stated that those who are proud, neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. And as a result they proceed on their inauspicious path and they ruin themselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we already explained what the path was. So now I am going to just read one other section. Here it is. We will read this section and then we will ask Maharaja to speak a little. Maharaja would you like to speak on this topic?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tYou are doing quite well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tI don't want to eclipse the presence of somebody who can also very nicely explain such an important topic. Why don't you speak about on what we have talked about so far before I go on to the next related topic? Would you like to say something.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tNothing comes to mind except determination, compassion and chanting the holy name.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tAnd we should not introduce anything that contradicts that path which has been established by our previous acaryas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Bhaktivinode Thakur continues: \"Inquiring about sad-dharma, eternal religious principles, is one of the disciple's devotional duties. Therefore Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.47) quotes the following statement from the Sri Naradiya Purana:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tacirad eva sarvarthah<br />\r\n\tsidhyaty esam abhipsitah<br />\r\n\tsad-dharmasyavabodhaya<br />\r\n\tyesam nirbandhini matih\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose who are eager to awaken their spiritual consciousness and who thus have unflinching, undeviated intelligence certainly attain the desired goal of life very soon.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo he is giving the qualification of one who has taken initiation. His qualification is that he wants to receive instructions from the spiritual master so that he can follow the spiritual master and the parampara. And what should be the basis of his inquiry? His inquiry should be based on his eagerness to awaken his spiritual consciousness and have unflinching and undeviated intelligence. And here, a very nice point also.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"As fortunate persons wish to follow the characteristics of the sadhus' devotional service, they similarly desire to know their duty.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis reminds of that verse, I think I spoke about the last time I was here. It is a verse from the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam where the demigods are praying to Krsna, describing Him as one Who reciprocates with the acaryas, by accepting the method by which they crossed the material ocean. And because He accepted their method, He demonstrates His kindness to both the acarya and to those who are still left behind, following the same method that the acarya crossed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact the example the demigods gave in that prayer is that the acaryas cross the ocean and then leave behind the boat for others to cross. In other words, the same method by which they crossed, Krsna accepts from the acarya's followers. In his commentary Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur says that they leave behind a bhakti movement, or an institution. Prabhupada said that their method included chanting, following in the footsteps of Rupa Goswami and giving the books of the previous acaryas. He said that's what he was doing. So that's the method. And he said that our followers should therefore accept that method to cross because Krsna accepted that method and anyone who follows that acarya, will also be able to cross by following the same method.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo here. \"As fortunate persons wish to follow the characteristics of the sadhus' devotional service, they similarly desire to know their duty. Unfortunate proud persons act just the opposite. As they search paths different from those of the sadhus, they disrespect the sadhus' determined conclusions while respecting their own. They do not care to preach the teachings of Mahaprabhu to the people of this world, rather they preach doctrines contradictory to those of Mahaprabhu. They do not know how much misfortune they are creating by this. Those who are simple endeavor to properly learn the teachings of the Lord from Sri Caitanya-caritamrta. The Lord's teachings are our only life. Sad-dharma lies in this alone. The bona fide disciple especially tries to understand sad-dharma. If he cannot understand on his own, then he prays at the feet of his siksa-guru ad learns from him. Those who have this kind of determination to know sad-dharma quickly achieve their desired goal. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.9) says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tanyabhilasita-sunyam<br />\r\n\tjnana-karmady-anavrtam<br />\r\n\tanukulyena krsnanu-<br />\r\n\tsilanam bhaktir uttama\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo sad-dharma means that the disciple should be very interested to know about pure devotional service. In fact, it's interesting. I am going to share a little realization I got…an experience I had just recently in Mayapura.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI gave a Bhagavatam class one day, based on a quote from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta about chanting. He was explaining what is meaningful chanting and what is useless chanting. Since I have the quote right here, I'll read it. It's a very good example from Amrita Vani, by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Pure devotees do not chant the Lord’s names to counteract sinful reactions, accumulate piety, attain heavenly pleasures, to mitigate famine, devastating epidemics, social unrest, disease, civil strife, or to obtain wealth or an earthly kingdom. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to ask Him to fulfill our wishes is to treat Him as our servant. This is an offense. Therefore calling the Lord’s names for any reason other than to attain His devotional service is useless. Jesus Christ told us not to take the Lord’s name in vain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"So I gave a class on this particular topic, quoting different references, explaining that the real purpose for chanting was for pure devotional service. I used different scriptural references from Bhagavatam and Caitanya Caritamrita. After class, one devotee came up and said, \"Maharaja, this is good. But what about me?\" (devotees laugh). It's very common. When devotees hear things like this quote they think, \"Yes. Hearing things about this is good. That's the platform that pure devotees are on. But what has this got to do with me?\" He then asked, \"What am I supposed to do in a situation like this. I'm not a pure devotee.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne important point to understand, which I tried to get across to him, is that none of us should think that we are pure devotees. But our only interest should be to inquire about pure devotional service. By inquiring about pure devotional service, I get opportunites hear the characteristics of pure devotional service. Therefore a devotee's responsibility is to inquire, to hear about, and to want to know the characteristics of pure devotional service. None of use should think that we are on the platform of pure devotional service. But Krsna becomes pleased when the devotees are eager to hear about, to learn about, and to inquire about the characteristics of pure devotional service, in other words, that, which is being quoted here. \"With firm intelligence inquiring about sad-dharma.\" When a devotee become determined to hear, that's how he gets purified. That's our method. That's our means of purification…hearing about the pure devotional service of the Lord's devotees and the Lord's reciprocation with pure devotional service. Should we hear about mixed devotional service so that we can feel good about ourselves? \"Oh I feel better now that I know that I can engage in mixed devotional service. Krsna will still accept me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, Bhagavatam says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\takamah sarva-kamo va<br />\r\n\tmoksa-kama udara-dhih<br />\r\n\ttivrena bhakti-yogena<br />\r\n\tyajeta purusam param\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhether one is full of all material desire, without any material desire, or desiring liberation…tivrena bhakti yogena. He worships the Lord with determination. This is the method for becoming purified from our tendencies to want to take the comfortable path, rather than the path which is set by the previous mahajanas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut without \"tivrena bhakti yogena\" not only do we become inclined to take the easy path, but those who are proud want credit, recognition and fame. Because they still have that within their hearts, they therefore think, \"Let me present a new path so that I can get followers from those who have doubts about following the previous acaryas. They'll think, \"Oh that sounds good. It's something new.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut an actual acarya, although he may apparently present something different, because he is an actual acarya, he doesn't deviate from constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord, compassion for others and determination. In what?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tIn tat-tat-karma-pravartanat\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tIn determination in the execution of devotional service by constant endeavor. This was exemplified by Haridas Thakur. So even though we're not pure devotees, we still follow the path set by the previous mahajanas, and even though we have material desires, we still inquire, \"How can I advance on the path of pure devotional service?\" Not, \"How can I feel comfortable not having achieved pure devotional service.\" That's the point that Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur is going to make here.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service.\" I'll read that again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service.\" What is this pure devotional symptom? The pure devotional symptom is that he wants to know what is sad-dharma. That is a pure devotional symptom. He tries to understand sad-dharma. Bhaktivinode Thakur continues, \"If he cannot understand on his own, then he prays at the feet of his siksa-guru and learns from him. Those who have this kind of determination to know sad-dharma, quickly achieve their desired goal.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service. If one depends on his own speculation, then unalloyed devotional service will not manifest in his heart.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, if one speculates, because he still has attachments and desires, he is going to come up with something not in line with our previous acaryas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBhaktivinode Thakur then says, \"then unalloyed devotional service will not manifest in his heart. We meet many so-called panditas who think they have understood the constitution of bhakti by their knowledge and intelligence. Some of them have concluded that devotional service mixed with jnana is pure bhakti, and some of them have concluded that devotional service mixed with karma is pure bhakti. They are so proud that if they hear the teachings of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, they say, 'Everyone can make their own conclusion. What is the need for taking the conclusion of Caitanya-caritamrta?' These people never come in touch with sad-dharma because they have no desire to know it. The result of performing their own concocted new process of devotional service is they can never relish pure devotion.\" [end of quote from Bhaktyaloka]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tAnd not inquiring about pure devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tbhukti-mukti-sprha yavat<br />\r\n\tpisaci hrdi vartate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs long as these desires for bhukti, for sense enjoyment, and mukti, for liberation, are within the heart, they are like two witches that haunt one like ghosts. As long as these two witches are there haunting one, one will never be able to taste the bliss of pure devotional service. And then they will say, \"What is this pure devotional service? It doesn't bring pleasure. I'm still getting pleasure anyway from this other thing\" (in other words, from a concoction). Then what does Bhaktivinode Thakur say next?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe very next point he makes, \"It is the duty of a sadhaka to give up personal enjoyment for the sake of Krsna. Sense gratification is called enjoyment. Dovetailing one's lust for sense gratification in the service of Krsna is renunciation of enjoyment. When one converts his world of enjoyment into what is favorable for devotional service, thus giving up the spirit of enjoying those objects and accepting everything as krsna-prasada, then this is called renunciation of enjoyment.\"[end of quote from Sri Bhaktyaloka]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAny questions or comments on anything that I've discussed so far? No? Is this the topic you asked me to speak on? Or is this…\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tI want to explain why I chose this topic.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tOh. In other words, I completely missed the whole point of your request?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tWhat happens is that everbody wants to know, in other words, there is only one way to (inaudible). In other words, we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of Srila Prabhupada's going to the West. So that's why this new topic has been brought up. So I don't know, I mean, how does…(inaudible)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tSo we should not deviate from what Srila Prabhupada has given us. Is that what you are saying? But this is the whole basis for not deviating from what Srila Prabhupada has given us. This is exactly it. It's the whole basis. Prabhupada has given us a mission.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tYes. He's teaching pure devotional service, but if we don't inquire about pure devotional service, then in one sense, we deviate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tI think he's looking for the externals. He wants to know what is a deviation from Prabhupada's mission? Is that what you're saying?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tI thought that whatever way we perform our devotional service, any sort of expertise brings pride. So scholarship in scriptures, like Prabhupada, and the Goswamis and all of our (?), we become sort of proud. It seems that there is one person in our project...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tWhat is that?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tYou don't have to say who it is.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tSomebody quoted something?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tNo. Some scholar in ISKCON thinks there is some sort of going against what the acaryas have established. What my next thought is that if certain people do not follow then certain things, or do we just keep it like that? And instead of giving our own personal ....(inaudible)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tAnyway, you don't think this covered that topic?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tI have just given this explanation why we have given this topic to speak on. That's all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tYes. I understand what he's referring to. Do you know what he's talking about?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tI don't need to know. The topic I spoke about speaks for itself. I don't need to know why I was asked to speak about this topic.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf we are going to present ourselves as an acarya then we should make sure that we stand on these three firm principles of our disciplic succession. That is… constantly chanting the holy name of the Lord, being compassionate to others, and being strictly determined to follow the path of the previous acaryas. And if those three items are there, then fine. But if they're not, then Bhaktivinode Thakur says that if one, unfortunately, is proud, having introduced a new path, he promenades on that new path, cheats himself, and unfortunately, he cheats everyone else who follows him. So this is the criteria.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSomeone may look for an excuse. \"Oh this can be very subjective.\" No. Everything can be subjective. But still we must know what is the criteria. How do we know that somebody is following these three things.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tWe might say that one is representing the previous acaryas, but if we jump over the present acaryas and give our own understanding of what the previous acaryas say and apply it in the present situation without following in the footsteps of the present acaryas…in other words, one has to has to follow the present acarya in order to follow the previous acaryas. You can't jump over. Does that make sense?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tYes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tAnd that's what you're indicating, right? If someone is going to the previous acaryas and are getting ideas that are contrary to the present acaryas. Is that a sense of pride, creating your own path based upon your own speculation of what the previous acaryas had said. That's what he's talking about, basically.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tDo we need to discuss details? I don't think so.Yes? You have a question?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tNot being a pure devotee, is that the natural consequence of a deviation. <br />\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tNot being a pure devotee?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tYes. So if you're not a pure devotee then naturally you have deviated. Isn't it?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tSomewhere along the line, there was a deviation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tAnd there would be a natural consequence of the deviation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tYes. And therefore the natural solution is to get back on the right path.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tIf you're following pure devotional service, then you might say that is also a pure devotee. If you're following the principles and inquiring about pure devotional service, that is pure devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tYes. I was hearing a lecture recently, Prabhupada was saying, I'm paraphrasing, but he was saying that even though we may not be able to completely follow, just having the desire to follow, Krsna accepts that as devotional service. The desire in itself. He accepts that as devotional service Krsna is \"bhava grahi janardana.\" He accepts the essence of a person's attitude. Even though he externally may not fully be able to perform things perfectly, but if he's sincere and he has a desire to perform, then Krsna accepts the essence of a devotee's attitude and then helps that devotee to make progress.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tI have a question. So what is the attitude of that person who inquired, \"that is not for me.\" So what is the understanding that he has?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tWhat was the understanding he has? Well actually I have to be honest. When I explained everything to him, he accepted it. He said, \"Thank you, you just cleared up all of my doubts.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tHe's one of many. But why do people think like that? What is the rationale that justifies that type of mentality?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tBecause their faith is weak. There are many reasons. It could be that they don't see an example. That could be another reason. They don't see any example of somebody to follow. But then they have to look within their own hearts to see why they don't see an example. It could be something in their own heart also that prevents them from seeing an example even though examples may still be there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tOr they maybe cultivated a mood of sense gratification...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tYes. As we just read. There is still some desire for karma and jnana, and therefore because there is still some desire for karma and jnana, one thinks, \"Yes. These things are pure bhakti.\" Even though it's mixed with karma, he thinks it's pure bhakti. And when he hears what pure bhakti is from Caitanya Caritamrita, he thinks, \"Why do I have to hear that?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tBut by hearing that, one becomes humble.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tBut by hearing it, by being willing to hear it, his heart becomes humble and he becomes purified. If he hears submissively. Submissive inquiry and service. And then his heart becomes purified. Krsna accepts him. In the Bhagavatam, the sages are saying to Suta Goswami, that because you are submissive, your gurus gave you all the favors necessary so that you can tell us exactly what is the science of devotional service. You can scientifically tell us because you were submissive to your guru. Isn't that the essence of the verse?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tAnd also because you are gentle by nature.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tGentle. Yes. Gentle by nature.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tBecause you are gentle by nature, you can receive it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tYes. Very good point. Instead of challenging due to pride. Yes. Another question?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee<br />\r\n\tWhen these disciples are creating new paths. Is there like a different meaning? Because devotees do have their own styles, they feel like, same mood, but they are ....(inaudible)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tThat's not a new path. If one follows the principles of determination in devotional service, giving up sense gratification, as Bhaktivinode Thakur goes on to explain next, genuine compassion. Genuine compassion means giving…we used Prabhupada as an example. What was his compassion? What was his \"panditah sama darsinah?\" His compassion was giving the conclusions of the previous acaryas. That was his compassion. So because he gave the conclusions of the previous acaryas, he didn't deviate from siddhanta. So that's not a new path, by presenting things in a different way to attract people to pure bhakti. But a new path is when it deviates from these three principles. That's a new path. And therefore we have to see if such a path is deviating from these three principles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot only that…it's one thing to introduce a new way for people to come to Krsna consciousness. But what are we going to bring them to when they come? We have to bring them to the path of the previous mahajanas…not to a new path and think that this is the accepted norm… some new way. It means that we have to teach by our example what is the path of the mahajanas. If we don't teach by own example, what the path is of the mahajanas, we may create a method for bringing others to Krsna consciousness but we may bring them to.... it's a like an example I oftentimes give. People call it \"bridge preaching.\" They build the bridge and then they get occupied with the bridge…they spend all their money and everything on the bridge and just think, \"Why don't we just stay on the bridge? What's the sense of going to other side? Why don't I just live on the bridge and bring everyone with me on the bridge? But the purpose of the bridge is to bring everyone to the other side. But if you don't show the other side, then what's the value of bridge preaching if there's no other side to go to? The other side is pure bhakti. So it means that I have to be engaged in pure bhakti. If I bring everybody to me and say, \"OK this is my bridge.\" But if I'm not engaged in pure bhakti then I'm preventing everybody from getting to the other side of the bridge. Then I'm not really bringing anyone anywhere. So I have to be following pure bhakti. Or at least, I have to bring people to those who are following pure bhakti, so that they can take them to the other side of the bridge. But the difficulty is that people get so obsessed with their new path, with their new mode of presentation, that they think, \"This is it! This is the new way. Let's all of us stay here and be satisfied with this and forget about what's on the other side.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, that example has to be there also. That if we are going to introduce something new, that's different, we better make sure that we are bringing people to pure bhakti. And if we are not interested to bring anybody to the other side, we better be sure that we're on the platform of pure bhakti ourselves. Otherwise, everybody we gather together, are not going anywhere. They are not making it to the other side. They are being cheated. Unfortunately.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tOr, if one is not creating a new path and one is following the present acaryas, but at the same time not bringing people ultimately to the goal. They are presenting in a very (inaudible) or dogmatic way, where is he going?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tThat the path in itself is the goal?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\r\n\tKrsna says something also to Lord Brahma at the end of Brahma Samhita, very similar to these three points, where He sums up the whole process in three statements. Three points which He also says, and glorifies Brahma and says, \"Oh Vidhi, one who is knowledge\", and He describes that the ultimate success is three principles, perserverance in practice, following scriptural evidence and what is that? I can't remember the actual word but the point is that proper Vaisnava culture, etiquette, behavior, in other words, the acara, or the practice, the proper mood of a Vaisnava. We might compare that to compassion and chanting of the holy name would be following the scripture, and determination would be perserverance of practice. It's very similar to what Krsna says to Lord Brahma. That is at the end of the fifth chapter of Brahma Samhita. It's one of the verses of the Brahma Samhita. It's at the very end of that fifth chapter. He glorifies Lord Brahma and then he sums up the whole process. Krsna's responding to Brahma's prayers. And he says, \"perserverance and practice, following scriptural evidence, and I can't remember the actual statement but the proper way to execute. In other words, a Vaisnava's behaviour, culture, which would be compassion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\r\n\tUnfortunately we're supposed to end at five. So we should end here. It's after five. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna. Jaya Srila Prabhupada!\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"safe_value": "<p>\n\tThis morning on my flight from Mumbai to Istanbul, I decided to transcribe and partially edit the talk I gave yesterday to the brahmacaris in Chowpatty. I felt that the topic they asked me to speak on was very relevant, not only now, but for the future as well. Another reason is that I also wanted to avoid sleeping on the flight and thought doing something like this would keep me awake. So here is the partially edited transcript I worked on today.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna<br />\n\t \n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tSo, I was just now given the topic to speak about… \"Loyalty to the parampara.\" It reminded me of a section in Sri Bhaktyaloka where Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur gives a nice explanation about the importance of following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas. He explains the dangers of not following, the consequences of not following, and the reasons why someone may not follow. So I'm thinking it might be good to read from there. Probably all I have to do is read it because it gives sufficient detail without any need for comment. But we can try to expand on the points he's made and I'm sure that Maharaja will have some comments to share too. Since we have an hour, we can also have a little discussion on the topic. Let's see if we can all benefit from it. So this is in the section entitled \"tat-tat-karma-pravartanat.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tIt's not in sadhu-vritti?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tNot in Sadhu Vritti, interestingly enough. You would think it would be there, but it's actually in the section of tat-tat-karma-pravartanat. Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur explains what are the favorable activities for devotional service and he lists the first five, which are 1) accepting a bona fide spiritual master, 2) inquiring from him, 3) taking initiation from him, 4) serving him, and then 5) following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas. So he elaborates on that within the context of those activities which are favorable for devotional service.  So I will read. I think this is the relevant part here…about receiving instructions from the spiritual master. He says: \"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should follow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh<br />\n\tpanthah santapa-varjitah<br />\n\tanavapta-sramam purve<br />\n\tyena santah pratasthire\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That path bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat's the translation of that verse.\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and satisfaction. When we discuss the path of devotional service exhibited by Sri Rupa, Sri Sanatana, Sri Raghunatha, and Sri Haridasa Thakura, then we feel such happiness that it cannot be described. When the miscreant Mohammedans tortured Haridasa Thakura, he said:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tkhanda khanda hai' deha yaya yadi prana<br />\n\ttabu ami vadane na chadi hari-nama<br />\n\te saba jivere krsna! karaha prasada<br />\n\tmora drohe nahu e sabara aparadha\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEven if my body is cut into pieces and I loose my life, I will never give up chanting the Lord's holy name. O Krsna, please be merciful upon these poor souls, kindly excuse them for their offense of torturing me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe're almost the end of this section. I will summarize it shortly. \"Maintaining this type of determination and being compassionate to all living entities while always chanting the holy name of Krsna is the path of devotional service exhibited by the previous mahajanas.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt gives the path. Three things. Can anyone repeat without me having to repeat? What were the three things?  Yes. Determination for devotional service, which was? Compassion towards others. Yes. That's the second. And, yes, the holy name. While always chanting the holy name. This was the path of devotional service exhibited by the previous mahajanas. So how did Haridas Thakur manifest that? We just quoted. What did he say? Yes. Correct. He said, \"You can cut my body to pieces and I'll never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" What else did he say? Yes. \"Kindly excuse them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tAll three of them are right there.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tYes. All three of them are right there. So that's the path. Continuing in Sri Bhaktyaloka…\"A path cannot be manufactured. Whatever path is there should be accepted by sadhus. Those who are proud and want fame try vigorously to discover new paths. Those who have good fortune from past lives give up pride and respect the established path. Those who are unfortunate promenade on a new path and thus cheat the world. Regarding such persons the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.46-47) quotes the Brahma-yamala as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsruti-smrti-puranadi-<br />\n\tpancaratra-vidhim vina<br />\n\taikantiki harer bhaktir<br />\n\tutpatayaiva kalpate<br />\n\tbhaktir aikantikiveyam<br />\n\tavicarat pratiyate<br />\n\tvastu tastu tatha naiva<br />\n\tyad asastriyateksyate\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, Puranas, and Narada Pancaratra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society. Such activities are born out of speculation and therefore they only superficially resemble unalloyed devotion because they are disrespectful to the Vedic injunctions. Disrespecting Vedic injunctions falls in the category of atheism. Whenever there is disrespect for the scriptures, which are the Lord's instructions, that cannot be devotional service.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is one section. There is more and it comes a little bit later. But here Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur is explaining a very important point, that these three principles are the path which has been established by the previous mahajanas… compassion, determination, and constantly chanting the holy name of the Lord. In other words, this is the path given by our previous acaryas. It's the path that all of our previous acaryas followed themselves…constant determination, chanting of the holy name of the Lord, and compassion. And those who deviate from that path, as described here, do so because of pride.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt reminds me of a conversation I oftentimes refer to, which was described by Giriraja Maharaja in Satsvarupa Maharaja's \"Prabhupada Lila.\" He told a story about one Indian man, who spoke out when Prabhupada was having a room conversation. I can't remember where it was. But I'm thinking that it must have been in Bombay. One man was challenging Prabhupada, saying that Prabhupada was being too critical. He said something like, \"Swamiji, why are you speaking so harshly. This is not sama darsinah.\" He was quoting the verse from the Bhagavad-gita, how a humble sage by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision, \"panditah sama darsinah.\" He said, \"You are using such strong language.\" I guess Prabhupada was using, as he oftentimes uses, the word \"rascal\", and the man was challenging Prabhupada, \"Why are you speaking so strongly. You should be equal to everyone.\" And Prabhupada was explaining that, \"Actually, these are not my words, they are Krsna's words. Krsna says, \"na mam duskritino mudha.\" He said, \"I am simply repeating Krsna's words.\" He also said, \"panditah sama darsinah is a very high position. I am not on that position. I have to discriminate. I have to see who is following what Krsna says and who is not following what Krsna says. That is my panditah sama darsinah. I don't discriminate. I give those instructions to everybody. And therefore, those who don't follow Krsna's instructions, Krsna says, 'you are a mudha.' So that's my equal vision. I give Krsna's instructions to everyone indiscriminately and either you are following what Krsna says or you are not following what Krsna says.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe man then further challenged Prabhupada. He said, \"But Swamiji, but what are you doing? All you are doing is just quoting somebody else. Why don't you speak for yourself? And then Prabhupada got very strong with him and he said, \"No. This is our system. We stand solidly on the strength of the words spoken by Krsna in our disciplic succesion. This is my duty. This is my qualification. I do not deviate. We stand on this position firmly. That is our qualification. To repeat what Krsna says.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI think Giriraja Maharaja was also quoted in the story he told, at least the way it was quoted in the \"Prabhupada Lila,\" that after the gathering, while everyone was walking out of the room, the man was heard saying to himself, \"Very interesting. The Swamiji is \"sama darsinah.\"You could say how Prabhupada was not discriminating. He was giving everyone what Krsna said without discrimination. And when Krsna says, \"You are a rascal, then you are a rascal. \"Krsna gives the criteria, therefore I do not discriminate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tavajananti mam mudha<br />\n\tmanusim tanum asritam<br />\n\tparam bhavam ajananto<br />\n\tmama bhuta-mahesvaram (BG 9.11)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo therefore our position is to always defend the parampara. In fact there is that well-known story when Vallabha Bhatta came to Lord Caitanya and asked him to hear his commentary on Srimad Bhagavatam. And as we know, nobody else would hear it. He was very frustrated. Nobody would listen to it. Of course, Lord Caitanya didn't give him any credibility. He explained the reason was because he did not accept the words of Sridhar Swami. Vallabha Bhatta thought his commentaries surpassed those of Sridhar Swami. Therefore Lord Caitanya said that, \"One who does not accept the swami [husband] as an authority, is a prostitute.\" And therefore he criticized Vallabha Bhatta for thinking he could surpass Sridhar Swami's commentaries, by presenting something better.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo of course, it is always the duty of the spiritual master to present the commentaries of the disciplic succession. If there appears to be discrepancies, he tries to show that there are no discrepancies at all. If he cannot show that there are no discrepancies, then he lets the statements of the acaryas stand by themselves. He doesn't try to impose an interpretation which is does not properly represent the conclusions of the previous acaryas. Therefore here it is stated that those who are proud, neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. And as a result they proceed on their inauspicious path and they ruin themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we already explained what the path was. So now I am going to just read one other section. Here it is. We will read this section and then we will ask Maharaja to speak a little. Maharaja would you like to speak on this topic?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tYou are doing quite well.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tI don't want to eclipse the presence of somebody who can also very nicely explain such an important topic. Why don't you speak about on what we have talked about so far before I go on to the next related topic? Would you like to say something.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tNothing comes to mind except determination, compassion and chanting the holy name.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tAnd we should not introduce anything that contradicts that path which has been established by our previous acaryas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Bhaktivinode Thakur continues: \"Inquiring about sad-dharma, eternal religious principles, is one of the disciple's devotional duties. Therefore Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.47) quotes the following statement from the Sri Naradiya Purana:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tacirad eva sarvarthah<br />\n\tsidhyaty esam abhipsitah<br />\n\tsad-dharmasyavabodhaya<br />\n\tyesam nirbandhini matih\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThose who are eager to awaken their spiritual consciousness and who thus have unflinching, undeviated intelligence certainly attain the desired goal of life very soon.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he is giving the qualification of one who has taken initiation. His qualification is that he wants to receive instructions from the spiritual master so that he can follow the spiritual master and the parampara. And what should be the basis of his inquiry? His inquiry should be based on his eagerness to awaken his spiritual consciousness and have unflinching and undeviated intelligence. And here, a very nice point also.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"As fortunate persons wish to follow the characteristics of the sadhus' devotional service, they similarly desire to know their duty.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis reminds of that verse, I think I spoke about the last time I was here. It is a verse from the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam where the demigods are praying to Krsna, describing Him as one Who reciprocates with the acaryas, by accepting the method by which they crossed the material ocean. And because He accepted their method, He demonstrates His kindness to both the acarya and to those who are still left behind, following the same method that the acarya crossed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact the example the demigods gave in that prayer is that the acaryas cross the ocean and then leave behind the boat for others to cross. In other words, the same method by which they crossed, Krsna accepts from the acarya's followers. In his commentary Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur says that they leave behind a bhakti movement, or an institution. Prabhupada said that their method included chanting, following in the footsteps of Rupa Goswami and giving the books of the previous acaryas. He said that's what he was doing. So that's the method. And he said that our followers should therefore accept that method to cross because Krsna accepted that method and anyone who follows that acarya, will also be able to cross by following the same method.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo here. \"As fortunate persons wish to follow the characteristics of the sadhus' devotional service, they similarly desire to know their duty. Unfortunate proud persons act just the opposite. As they search paths different from those of the sadhus, they disrespect the sadhus' determined conclusions while respecting their own. They do not care to preach the teachings of Mahaprabhu to the people of this world, rather they preach doctrines contradictory to those of Mahaprabhu. They do not know how much misfortune they are creating by this. Those who are simple endeavor to properly learn the teachings of the Lord from Sri Caitanya-caritamrta. The Lord's teachings are our only life. Sad-dharma lies in this alone. The bona fide disciple especially tries to understand sad-dharma. If he cannot understand on his own, then he prays at the feet of his siksa-guru ad learns from him. Those who have this kind of determination to know sad-dharma quickly achieve their desired goal. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.9) says:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tanyabhilasita-sunyam<br />\n\tjnana-karmady-anavrtam<br />\n\tanukulyena krsnanu-<br />\n\tsilanam bhaktir uttama\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo sad-dharma means that the disciple should be very interested to know about pure devotional service. In fact, it's interesting. I am going to share a little realization I got…an experience I had just recently in Mayapura.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI gave a Bhagavatam class one day, based on a quote from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta about chanting. He was explaining what is meaningful chanting and what is useless chanting. Since I have the quote right here, I'll read it. It's a very good example from Amrita Vani, by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Pure devotees do not chant the Lord’s names to counteract sinful reactions, accumulate piety, attain heavenly pleasures, to mitigate famine, devastating epidemics, social unrest, disease, civil strife, or to obtain wealth or an earthly kingdom. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to ask Him to fulfill our wishes is to treat Him as our servant. This is an offense. Therefore calling the Lord’s names for any reason other than to attain His devotional service is useless. Jesus Christ told us not to take the Lord’s name in vain.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"So I gave a class on this particular topic, quoting different references, explaining that the real purpose for chanting was for pure devotional service. I used different scriptural references from Bhagavatam and Caitanya Caritamrita. After class, one devotee came up and said, \"Maharaja, this is good. But what about me?\" (devotees laugh). It's very common. When devotees hear things like this quote they think, \"Yes. Hearing things about this is good. That's the platform that pure devotees are on. But what has this got to do with me?\" He then asked, \"What am I supposed to do in a situation like this. I'm not a pure devotee.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne important point to understand, which I tried to get across to him, is that none of us should think that we are pure devotees. But our only interest should be to inquire about pure devotional service. By inquiring about pure devotional service, I get opportunites hear the characteristics of pure devotional service. Therefore a devotee's responsibility is to inquire, to hear about, and to want to know the characteristics of pure devotional service. None of use should think that we are on the platform of pure devotional service. But Krsna becomes pleased when the devotees are eager to hear about, to learn about, and to inquire about the characteristics of pure devotional service, in other words, that, which is being quoted here. \"With firm intelligence inquiring about sad-dharma.\" When a devotee become determined to hear, that's how he gets purified. That's our method. That's our means of purification…hearing about the pure devotional service of the Lord's devotees and the Lord's reciprocation with pure devotional service. Should we hear about mixed devotional service so that we can feel good about ourselves? \"Oh I feel better now that I know that I can engage in mixed devotional service. Krsna will still accept me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, Bhagavatam says:\n</p>\n<p>\n\takamah sarva-kamo va<br />\n\tmoksa-kama udara-dhih<br />\n\ttivrena bhakti-yogena<br />\n\tyajeta purusam param\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhether one is full of all material desire, without any material desire, or desiring liberation…tivrena bhakti yogena. He worships the Lord with determination. This is the method for becoming purified from our tendencies to want to take the comfortable path, rather than the path which is set by the previous mahajanas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut without \"tivrena bhakti yogena\" not only do we become inclined to take the easy path, but those who are proud want credit, recognition and fame. Because they still have that within their hearts, they therefore think, \"Let me present a new path so that I can get followers from those who have doubts about following the previous acaryas. They'll think, \"Oh that sounds good. It's something new.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut an actual acarya, although he may apparently present something different, because he is an actual acarya, he doesn't deviate from constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord, compassion for others and determination. In what?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tIn tat-tat-karma-pravartanat\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tIn determination in the execution of devotional service by constant endeavor. This was exemplified by Haridas Thakur. So even though we're not pure devotees, we still follow the path set by the previous mahajanas, and even though we have material desires, we still inquire, \"How can I advance on the path of pure devotional service?\" Not, \"How can I feel comfortable not having achieved pure devotional service.\" That's the point that Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur is going to make here.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service.\" I'll read that again.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service.\" What is this pure devotional symptom? The pure devotional symptom is that he wants to know what is sad-dharma. That is a pure devotional symptom. He tries to understand sad-dharma. Bhaktivinode Thakur continues, \"If he cannot understand on his own, then he prays at the feet of his siksa-guru and learns from him. Those who have this kind of determination to know sad-dharma, quickly achieve their desired goal.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service. If one depends on his own speculation, then unalloyed devotional service will not manifest in his heart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, if one speculates, because he still has attachments and desires, he is going to come up with something not in line with our previous acaryas.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBhaktivinode Thakur then says, \"then unalloyed devotional service will not manifest in his heart. We meet many so-called panditas who think they have understood the constitution of bhakti by their knowledge and intelligence. Some of them have concluded that devotional service mixed with jnana is pure bhakti, and some of them have concluded that devotional service mixed with karma is pure bhakti. They are so proud that if they hear the teachings of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, they say, 'Everyone can make their own conclusion. What is the need for taking the conclusion of Caitanya-caritamrta?' These people never come in touch with sad-dharma because they have no desire to know it. The result of performing their own concocted new process of devotional service is they can never relish pure devotion.\" [end of quote from Bhaktyaloka]\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tAnd not inquiring about pure devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tbhukti-mukti-sprha yavat<br />\n\tpisaci hrdi vartate\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs long as these desires for bhukti, for sense enjoyment, and mukti, for liberation, are within the heart, they are like two witches that haunt one like ghosts. As long as these two witches are there haunting one, one will never be able to taste the bliss of pure devotional service. And then they will say, \"What is this pure devotional service? It doesn't bring pleasure. I'm still getting pleasure anyway from this other thing\" (in other words, from a concoction). Then what does Bhaktivinode Thakur say next?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe very next point he makes, \"It is the duty of a sadhaka to give up personal enjoyment for the sake of Krsna. Sense gratification is called enjoyment. Dovetailing one's lust for sense gratification in the service of Krsna is renunciation of enjoyment. When one converts his world of enjoyment into what is favorable for devotional service, thus giving up the spirit of enjoying those objects and accepting everything as krsna-prasada, then this is called renunciation of enjoyment.\"[end of quote from Sri Bhaktyaloka]\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAny questions or comments on anything that I've discussed so far? No? Is this the topic you asked me to speak on? Or is this…\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tI want to explain why I chose this topic.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tOh. In other words, I completely missed the whole point of your request?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tWhat happens is that everbody wants to know, in other words, there is only one way to (inaudible). In other words, we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of Srila Prabhupada's going to the West. So that's why this new topic has been brought up. So I don't know, I mean, how does…(inaudible)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tSo we should not deviate from what Srila Prabhupada has given us. Is that what you are saying? But this is the whole basis for not deviating from what Srila Prabhupada has given us. This is exactly it. It's the whole basis. Prabhupada has given us a mission.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tYes. He's teaching pure devotional service, but if we don't inquire about pure devotional service, then in one sense, we deviate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tI think he's looking for the externals. He wants to know what is a deviation from Prabhupada's mission? Is that what you're saying?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tI thought that whatever way we perform our devotional service, any sort of expertise brings pride. So scholarship in scriptures, like Prabhupada, and the Goswamis and all of our (?), we become sort of proud. It seems that there is one person in our project...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tWhat is that?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tYou don't have to say who it is.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tSomebody quoted something?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tNo. Some scholar in ISKCON thinks there is some sort of going against what the acaryas have established. What my next thought is that if certain people do not follow then certain things, or do we just keep it like that? And instead of giving our own personal ....(inaudible)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tAnyway, you don't think this covered that topic?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tI have just given this explanation why we have given this topic to speak on. That's all.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tYes. I understand what he's referring to. Do you know what he's talking about?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tI don't need to know. The topic I spoke about speaks for itself. I don't need to know why I was asked to speak about this topic.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we are going to present ourselves as an acarya then we should make sure that we stand on these three firm principles of our disciplic succession. That is… constantly chanting the holy name of the Lord, being compassionate to others, and being strictly determined to follow the path of the previous acaryas. And if those three items are there, then fine. But if they're not, then Bhaktivinode Thakur says that if one, unfortunately, is proud, having introduced a new path, he promenades on that new path, cheats himself, and unfortunately, he cheats everyone else who follows him. So this is the criteria.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSomeone may look for an excuse. \"Oh this can be very subjective.\" No. Everything can be subjective. But still we must know what is the criteria. How do we know that somebody is following these three things.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tWe might say that one is representing the previous acaryas, but if we jump over the present acaryas and give our own understanding of what the previous acaryas say and apply it in the present situation without following in the footsteps of the present acaryas…in other words, one has to has to follow the present acarya in order to follow the previous acaryas. You can't jump over. Does that make sense?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tYes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tAnd that's what you're indicating, right? If someone is going to the previous acaryas and are getting ideas that are contrary to the present acaryas. Is that a sense of pride, creating your own path based upon your own speculation of what the previous acaryas had said. That's what he's talking about, basically.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tDo we need to discuss details? I don't think so.Yes? You have a question?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tNot being a pure devotee, is that the natural consequence of a deviation. <br />\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tNot being a pure devotee?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tYes. So if you're not a pure devotee then naturally you have deviated. Isn't it?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tSomewhere along the line, there was a deviation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tAnd there would be a natural consequence of the deviation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tYes. And therefore the natural solution is to get back on the right path.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tIf you're following pure devotional service, then you might say that is also a pure devotee. If you're following the principles and inquiring about pure devotional service, that is pure devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tYes. I was hearing a lecture recently, Prabhupada was saying, I'm paraphrasing, but he was saying that even though we may not be able to completely follow, just having the desire to follow, Krsna accepts that as devotional service. The desire in itself. He accepts that as devotional service Krsna is \"bhava grahi janardana.\" He accepts the essence of a person's attitude. Even though he externally may not fully be able to perform things perfectly, but if he's sincere and he has a desire to perform, then Krsna accepts the essence of a devotee's attitude and then helps that devotee to make progress.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tI have a question. So what is the attitude of that person who inquired, \"that is not for me.\" So what is the understanding that he has?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tWhat was the understanding he has? Well actually I have to be honest. When I explained everything to him, he accepted it. He said, \"Thank you, you just cleared up all of my doubts.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tHe's one of many. But why do people think like that? What is the rationale that justifies that type of mentality?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tBecause their faith is weak. There are many reasons. It could be that they don't see an example. That could be another reason. They don't see any example of somebody to follow. But then they have to look within their own hearts to see why they don't see an example. It could be something in their own heart also that prevents them from seeing an example even though examples may still be there.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tOr they maybe cultivated a mood of sense gratification...\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tYes. As we just read. There is still some desire for karma and jnana, and therefore because there is still some desire for karma and jnana, one thinks, \"Yes. These things are pure bhakti.\" Even though it's mixed with karma, he thinks it's pure bhakti. And when he hears what pure bhakti is from Caitanya Caritamrita, he thinks, \"Why do I have to hear that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tBut by hearing that, one becomes humble.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tBut by hearing it, by being willing to hear it, his heart becomes humble and he becomes purified. If he hears submissively. Submissive inquiry and service. And then his heart becomes purified. Krsna accepts him. In the Bhagavatam, the sages are saying to Suta Goswami, that because you are submissive, your gurus gave you all the favors necessary so that you can tell us exactly what is the science of devotional service. You can scientifically tell us because you were submissive to your guru. Isn't that the essence of the verse?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tAnd also because you are gentle by nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tGentle. Yes. Gentle by nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tBecause you are gentle by nature, you can receive it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tYes. Very good point. Instead of challenging due to pride. Yes. Another question?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee<br />\n\tWhen these disciples are creating new paths. Is there like a different meaning? Because devotees do have their own styles, they feel like, same mood, but they are ....(inaudible)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tThat's not a new path. If one follows the principles of determination in devotional service, giving up sense gratification, as Bhaktivinode Thakur goes on to explain next, genuine compassion. Genuine compassion means giving…we used Prabhupada as an example. What was his compassion? What was his \"panditah sama darsinah?\" His compassion was giving the conclusions of the previous acaryas. That was his compassion. So because he gave the conclusions of the previous acaryas, he didn't deviate from siddhanta. So that's not a new path, by presenting things in a different way to attract people to pure bhakti. But a new path is when it deviates from these three principles. That's a new path. And therefore we have to see if such a path is deviating from these three principles.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNot only that…it's one thing to introduce a new way for people to come to Krsna consciousness. But what are we going to bring them to when they come? We have to bring them to the path of the previous mahajanas…not to a new path and think that this is the accepted norm… some new way. It means that we have to teach by our example what is the path of the mahajanas. If we don't teach by own example, what the path is of the mahajanas, we may create a method for bringing others to Krsna consciousness but we may bring them to.... it's a like an example I oftentimes give. People call it \"bridge preaching.\" They build the bridge and then they get occupied with the bridge…they spend all their money and everything on the bridge and just think, \"Why don't we just stay on the bridge? What's the sense of going to other side? Why don't I just live on the bridge and bring everyone with me on the bridge? But the purpose of the bridge is to bring everyone to the other side. But if you don't show the other side, then what's the value of bridge preaching if there's no other side to go to? The other side is pure bhakti. So it means that I have to be engaged in pure bhakti. If I bring everybody to me and say, \"OK this is my bridge.\" But if I'm not engaged in pure bhakti then I'm preventing everybody from getting to the other side of the bridge. Then I'm not really bringing anyone anywhere. So I have to be following pure bhakti. Or at least, I have to bring people to those who are following pure bhakti, so that they can take them to the other side of the bridge. But the difficulty is that people get so obsessed with their new path, with their new mode of presentation, that they think, \"This is it! This is the new way. Let's all of us stay here and be satisfied with this and forget about what's on the other side.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, that example has to be there also. That if we are going to introduce something new, that's different, we better make sure that we are bringing people to pure bhakti. And if we are not interested to bring anybody to the other side, we better be sure that we're on the platform of pure bhakti ourselves. Otherwise, everybody we gather together, are not going anywhere. They are not making it to the other side. They are being cheated. Unfortunately.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tOr, if one is not creating a new path and one is following the present acaryas, but at the same time not bringing people ultimately to the goal. They are presenting in a very (inaudible) or dogmatic way, where is he going?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tThat the path in itself is the goal?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCandramauli Swami<br />\n\tKrsna says something also to Lord Brahma at the end of Brahma Samhita, very similar to these three points, where He sums up the whole process in three statements. Three points which He also says, and glorifies Brahma and says, \"Oh Vidhi, one who is knowledge\", and He describes that the ultimate success is three principles, perserverance in practice, following scriptural evidence and what is that? I can't remember the actual word but the point is that proper Vaisnava culture, etiquette, behavior, in other words, the acara, or the practice, the proper mood of a Vaisnava. We might compare that to compassion and chanting of the holy name would be following the scripture, and determination would be perserverance of practice. It's very similar to what Krsna says to Lord Brahma. That is at the end of the fifth chapter of Brahma Samhita. It's one of the verses of the Brahma Samhita. It's at the very end of that fifth chapter. He glorifies Lord Brahma and then he sums up the whole process. Krsna's responding to Brahma's prayers. And he says, \"perserverance and practice, following scriptural evidence, and I can't remember the actual statement but the proper way to execute. In other words, a Vaisnava's behaviour, culture, which would be compassion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNiranjana Swami<br />\n\tUnfortunately we're supposed to end at five. So we should end here. It's after five. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna. Jaya Srila Prabhupada!\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is a partially edited Sunday Feast Lecture given in Moscow on January 27, 2013 with His Holiness Bhakti Caitanya Swami<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI am very happy to be here today with all of you. I am especially happy to be able to be here with His Holiness Bhakti Caitanya Swami. I think all of you should give him a very warm welcome. It is a great privilege for me to be with him. It may appear to be rather bold of me to be speaking before him but we discussed who should speak first and I didn’t tell him this, but I decided that I should probably speak first so that he could correct me after I finish speaking. He is very learned. I am oftentimes amazed at the depth of not only his scholarship but also his wisdom. He is an unlimited ocean full of nectarian pastimes of Krsna in Vrndavan. This is why I wanted to speak first (laughter), because I have the microphone. I am oftentimes in his presence feeling very much dwarfed by his advancement in spiritual life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(laughing and speaking in Russian referring to Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja’s microphone): It’s not working!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami, speaking in Russian):”It’s not truth.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot only is he a GBC godbrother, but he is also this year’s chairman of the GBC. In other words all of the ISKCON matters come directly into his email box every day. He has fulfilled that responsibility so well that this is the second time that he’s been asked to do it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami speaking in Russian): “Please, speak about Krsna.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Niranjana Swami speaking in Russian): “I am speaking. When I speak about Krsna’s devotee, it is like speaking about Krsna.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami speaking in Russian): “You are talking about a devotee? I am not a devotee”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI will stop. Because I already got my message across, and therefore you fully understand why I won’t speak very long so that he can have the opportunity to enlighten all of us and for that alone I feel very grateful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was requested today to speak on a particular topic. Often times when I visit the temples I ask the leaders: “What would you like me to speak about?” I won’t tell you what I was asked to speak about but I have chosen the verse that’s connected to the topic. I selected it just a few minutes before coming here and I mentioned it to Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja on the way because he said that he will speak about whatever topic I will speak about.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI am reading a verse from the Srimad Bhagavatam 4.8.34. I will read first the Sanskrit and then the translation and commentary\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tgunadhikan mudam lipsed<br />\r\n\tanukrosam gunadhamat<br />\r\n\tmaitrim samanad anvicchen<br />\r\n\tna tapair abhibhuyate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Every man should act like this: when he meets a person more qualified than himself he should be very pleased. When he meets someone less qualified than himself, he should be compassionate towards him, and when he meets someone equal to himself, he should make friendship with him. In this way one is never affected by the three-fold miseries of this world.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGenerally when we find someone more qualified than ourselves, we become envious of him; when we find someone less qualified, we deride him; and when we find someone equal we become very proud of our activities. These are the causes of all material tribulations. The great sage Narada therefore advised that a devotee should act perfectly. Instead of being envious of a more qualified man, one should be jolly to receive him. Instead of being oppressive to a less qualified man, one should be compassionate toward him just to raise him to the proper standard. And when one meets an equal, instead of being proud of one's own activities before him, one should treat him as a friend. One should also have compassion for the people in general, who are suffering due to forgetfulness of Krsna. These important functions will make one happy within this material world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a very nice verse spoken by Sri Narada Muni to Dhruva Maharaja. He is beginning his instructions to Dhruva in order to prepare him for his purification. Whenever there are instructions given by a saintly person, it is understood that they are meant for the purification of the recipient. Narada Muni is giving an important instruction here, which clearly stated, is meant to help one become unaffected by the miseries of this material world. Most people do not fully understand why they experience misery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact one of our great acharyas, Srila Sanatana Goswami, taught by his example. When he came in the presence of his superior, the first question he asked was, “Who am I and why do I have to suffer the three-fold miseries?” In other words he was teaching by his example that an intelligent person should try to understand why he is suffering from miseries. He should not look for a temporary solution but should look for something more permanent than treating the symptom.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOftentimes we may ask ourselves, “Why am I suffering like this?” However, most people will look for a way to relieve the suffering instead of trying to find the root cause of suffering. In their attempt to find more immediate relief they fail to gain the permanent solution. In fact, if we don’t know the root cause of suffering, in our efforts to obtain relief, we may mistake relief for happiness. But the reality is that this relief is the cause of further distress. This is profound if you think about it. Most people will not dig down deep enough to look for the actual cause of suffering. For them, immediate relief is the more suitable solution.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact, a five year old boy, Prahlada Maharaja, had something to say in this regard. He said, “In this material world every materialist is endeavouring for happiness and he is trying to mitigate his distress and therefore he is acting accordingly. Actually one cannot be happy as long as he endeavours for happiness; because as soon as he begins his endeavours for happiness, immediately his conditions for distress appear.”&nbsp; For a five year old boy, that's a profound statement. He is saying that in the material world everyone is trying to be happy and to relieve themselves from distress. And they think, \"If I can achieve some immediate happiness, then I am happy.\" But they don't know the price they have to pay for that temporary relief, and that is: as long as I am only thinking about \"my\" happiness I am creating future distress for myself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat is the nature of the materialistic person: he's motivated by his own happiness even though he may also be motivated to make others happy. It might seem like that’s selfless. But if he is motivated to make others happy as long as it makes him happy, that is not selfless. Sometimes he may try to make others happy by implicating them in sinful activities which will only be the cause of his own distress. He thinks, “I am making him happy.\" But he becomes implicated himself and thus creates his own future distress.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore an intelligent person should understand what is the root cause of suffering in this world and should seek a solution which will be beneficial for everyone and not just himself. When I think only of my own happiness it might not be necessarily beneficial for others. Unfortunately, the nature of this world is that people will do anything for their own happiness at the expense of others. They may say: “Sorry, I didn’t mean to do it. I didn’t mean to cause you suffering.\" There is an expression in English “That’s the way the cookie crumbles.” It’s a very popular statement in America. In other words, what it really means is, \"You'll just have to accept that’s the way it happened, what can I do?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNarada Muni is here giving instructions to Dhruva Maharaja. Of course this is not the complete set of instructions on how to become free from misery. We can think of many instructions on how to become free from misery. But if we analyze his instruction here, he is telling Dhruva Maharaja how to become free from envy, because envy is a fundamental cause of our suffering in this world. Until one’s heart becomes free from envy then, according to a statement of Prahlada Maharaja in another verse in the Fifth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, one will never be able to think of the welfare of others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs much as one may try to help others or to make others happy, until this envy is completely uprooted from one’s heart, there will always be some tinge of selfish motivation. Therefore this instruction is a very good instruction on how to become unaffected by material miseries and how to become genuinely happy in this world and happiness is definitely something that everybody is aspiring for.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Srimad Bhagavatam states:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido<br />\r\n\tna labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah<br />\r\n\ttal labhyate duhkhavad anyatah sukham<br />\r\n\tkalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the lowest planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.\" (SB 1.5.18)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn intelligent person knows that happiness will come, just as miseries come without asking for them. As we have oftentimes explain…nobody makes plans to suffer, nobody asks “How can I be miserable today?” Did anyone wake up in this morning and make plans how to suffer today? An intelligent person doesn’t do that. An intelligent person will think, \"What can I do that’s productive today?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, as Bhagavatam states miseries come without planning for them. I don’t have to make plans for them. They come. An intelligent person also knows that happiness will come in the same way. Therefore an intelligent person endeavors neither for happiness nor distress, specifically speaking about material happiness. However, as far as spiritual happiness is concerned, which is the happiness which satisfies the self, spiritual happiness comes by making efforts to satisfy the Lord and His devotees.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBhajaniya-parama-purusha-sukha-matra-sva-sukhatvam\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn his sandarbhas, Srila Jiva Goswami states that to the degree that we can satisfy the Supreme, to that degree we can also become happy. The benefit of such happiness is that it’s so satisfying to the self that it makes material happiness insignificant, so insignificant that the person who experiences it no longer feels the need to endeavor for it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow, wouldn’t it be nice if every one of us had somebody who was always thinking about our happiness, making arrangements for us without us even having to think about how to be happy? Imagine if you had a real good friend who would always watch every single move that you make, always anticipating what he could do so that you could be happy. If they saw any potential obstacle or difficulty that you would confront, they would immediately arrange to mitigate it for you. Wouldn’t you like to have a friend like that? The fact of the matter is: you do. And everybody does. The difficulty is that we have forgotten our connection with Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn so many places Krsna says in the Bhagavad-gita 9.22, if you make endeavors to Me, I will help you. If you always remember Me, I will carry what you lack and I will preserve what you have. If you endeavor to serve Me, I will illuminate transcendental knowledge within your heart, by which you will be able to realize your full potential, your spiritual identity, and become completely free from all identification with suffering within this world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe fact is that everyone of us has a friend within each and every one of our hearts, who wants nothing more than to make arrangements for our happiness. He is ready, He is waiting for us to turn to Him, to recognize Him, and to follow His dictation on how we can come closer to Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore if we want to find the solution to suffering in this world, if we are intelligent, we will try to understand how to establish our connection with our best friend. Our best friend is trying to tell us, through His representatives, manifesting Himself in so many ways by which we can approach Him. And all He is asking is that we serve Him, cultivate and develop our love for Him, remember Him, follow His instructions, serve those who are dear to Him, and glorify Him. In so many ways He’s giving us the means to establish our connection with Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore an intelligent person should try to make that connection strong. The more we can strengthen our connection with Him, our best friend, the more our best friend says that He will relieve us from the miseries of material life. He says to Arjuna, “If you abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me, I will take all those reactions away that you’ve accumulated for millions of births.” Therefore an intelligent person endeavors to serve the Supreme. By making endeavors to serve the Supreme he automatically transcends the happiness and distress of this world. Now, of course we said automatically&nbsp;&nbsp; it’s not just like that (snapping fingers). It can be like that (snapping fingers). Generally it isn’t. Generally purification of heart has to take place. Srila Rupa Goswami describes,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tiha yasya harer dasye<br />\r\n\tkarmana manasa gira<br />\r\n\tnikhilasv apy avasthasu<br />\r\n\tjivan-muktah sa ucyate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Anyone who fully engages his mind, his body, his words in the service to Krsna, he is already a liberated soul even while within this material body. “\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA devotee of the Lord does not have to wait until he gives up this body for liberation. He can experience liberation, freedom from suffering, even while within the body. Why? Because Krsna is there, removing all obstacles on his path and satisfying the devotee within his heart, making the devotee so satisfied that he is not even conscious of the sufferings of this world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Srimad Bhagavatam 3.25.23 it is stated,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tmad-asrayah katha mrstah<br />\r\n\tsrnvanti kathayanti ca\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Engaged constantly in hearing and chanting about Me, those sadhus are not affected by material miseries in this world, because they are always filled with thought of Me” – Lord Kapiladeva says. Of course in the next verse He says\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi<br />\r\n\tsarva-sańga-vivarjitah&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe says to His mother, Devahuti ,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“O My mother, o virtuous lady, you should seek out the association of saintly persons, become attached to them by hearing from them. When you will become attached it will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachments.” (SB 3.25.24)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo the point is that a devotee must learn how to conduct himself in this world, so that his heart can become purified and free from envy, by knowing how to properly deal with everyone in this world on the spiritual platform. Not on the platform of competition, not on the platform of being envious of the superior or by deriding persons who are not as well off or advanced as ourselves, but by seeing how to properly engage in meaningful relationships with everyone on the spiritual platform, a person can become happy in this world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd now we will hear from Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja who will tell us how to do that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tH. H.Bhakti Caitanya Swami :\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI feel very honored, privileged and embarrassed to be sitting here with Maharaja. Prabhupada talks about the mosquito sitting on the lap of the king, and people are coming and bowing down before the king and the mosquito thinks, “Ha! See, they are bowing down before me!” So that’s my position here.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(speaking in Russian): That’s truth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Niranjana Swami, speaking in Russian): Not truth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami, speaking in Russian): It’s truth, 108 percent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe real reason, from my perspective, why I wanted to speak after Maharaja is because I have nothing to say, but I can pick something up if I listen to Maharaja. He is just so inspired that I can pick some inspiration from him. It’s truth and it’s really, really nice, the association of devotees particularly, special devotees, it’s really very nice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNear Varsana there is a village with still a quite pleasant kunda, that is called Kisori Kund. One day Srimati Radharani was sitting with her gopi friends and preparing to meet with Krsna, Who was due to come any time. They were in some anxiety, \"He might just walk around the corner right now and we are not quite ready.\" So Srimati Radharani was almost ready except she hadn’t put her anjana on her eyes. You know what I mean, anjana, they call it kajal, it’s the black substance ladies put right on the eye lids.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(speaking in Russian): Do you understand? Good!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo she had put some anjana on one eye and Krsna appeared on the scene and He saw Radharani and of course He is stunned. But then He came right up to Radharani and looking at her and He saw how beautiful and just saturated with devotion she was but she didn’t have anjana on. So Krsna called out, “You are nir-anjana!” Yes. And then Krsna put anjana on Radharani’s eyes. So this place is there. It’s called Anjanoka, and this is called nir-anjana lila. It’s there in the sastra. So niranjana – this is special.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaharaja was saying so nicely about associating with different types of devotees and different types of people. You know, Srila Prabhupada said that we will have another ISKCON in the spiritual world and we will all be together in the spiritual world. One devotee was telling me, I won’t mention his name, he said that when he heard that, his spontaneous reaction was, he thought of some devotees he had problems with, and he thought, “We're going to be together forever!? Oh no!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe thing is we have to become such a person, such a devotee, so we can fit in with the other devotees and be at home with the other devotees. It’s one thing to work with someone, oh, you just have to work together, you just may do it. Or, you just meet someone sometimes and you just briefly have to interact in a certain way, but when you share the same home as a person, well you better get on with the people you share the home with. And in Vrndavan, Krsna is at home, Krsna is God at home and Narayana or Vishnu is more like God at work. Vishnu is dealing with all the conditioned souls, He is in the heart of even the greatest demons and most fallen creatures and He does that because it’s like His work you could say. But in Vrndavan, Krsna is God at home. So to go home you have to be that sort of person who Krsna is willing to be at home with. The home is where the heart is. Krsna only lets people into His home if they have really captured His heart. We have to be able to get on with the devotees. At least get on, but actually we should really develop some real affection for the devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne time Narada Muni attended the meeting of all the major holy places. They were having this big debate: which is the king of all of us, the topmost of all the holy places? They were debating and discussing and one holy place was saying, “It’s me!” Another was saying, “No, no, no! It’s me!” In the end they had a vote and Prayag was elected the tirtharaja, or the king of all the holy places. Narada Muni was there and he was witnessing all of this, and at the end he went up and he congratulated Prayag. “You are such a nice holy place, I like to visit you so much” And Prayag said, “Yes, thank you, I feel good about it, but I have one problem: all the holy places here they all respected me, they all accepted me as the king, but where is Vrndavan? Why isn’t Vrndavan here? Why won’t Vrndavan come and accept me as the king? Prayag said “well he associates with Krsna a lot, maybe he got puffed up”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNarada Muni said, “You know, I don’t think it’s like that. I think what you should do is go and ask Krsna.” So Prayag went and he visited Krsna, and he explained that this is the situation: all the holy places respected me but not Vrndavan. Krsna started crying and said, “Vrndavan is not like you. Vrndavan is not just a holy place. Vrndavan is My home and home is where the heart is, so My heart is there in Vrndavan.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVrndavan Dham is unique amongst all the holy places. Krsna only really let’s people into Vrndavan if He feels confident enough, sure enough, “I can let this person have My heart.” Therefore in the Nectar of Devotion, Srila Rupa Goswami explains that Krsna may give material enjoyment, He can easily give impersonal realization, but pure devotional service, particularly on the level of Vrndavan, oh, Krsna is very careful before He gives that!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the 12th chapter of Bhagavad-gita, verses 13 to 20, Krsna explains the characteristics of a person who is very dear to Him. If a person is very humble and kind to others then he is very dear to Him. Krsna gives so many different qualities, which He says, if you have these qualities, you become very dear to Me. So Srila Prabhupada gave one lecture on verses 13 and 14 from that chapter and Srila Prabhupada is making this point that we have to become like that and then Srila Prabhupada says, “Yes, this is Krsna Consciousness. How will Krsna love me? How will I become such a person that Krsna will see me and think: \"There He is! That’s My person, My dear devotee.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is what the process of devotional service is all about. Such an important part of that is how we associate with the devotees. Krsna, before He lets someone into His heart, into Vrndavan, Krsna tests to see: is this person really serious completely? Do they have some other ideas also? Krsna tests the devotees, He is in one sense, you could say, leading the devotees down the path back to His lotus feet, putting devotees through different experiences which will help them to become that sort of person. Sometimes there are tests and we may not appreciate it. But really it is for our benefit and for our development as devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are many interesting stories in this regard and we can mention one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere was a king and he was a devotee something, something, mixed position. He had a minister, they were very close to each other but the minister was really a devotee. The king, of course is a ksatrya, and a traditional ksatrya must keep strong and able to fight. The ksatryas sometimes would go out and hunt animals and this king, he would also do that. One day they were out in the forest and the king was aiming an arrow at some animal and he was just about to fire the arrow but then he slipped. The arrow jumped out of his hand and it cut off the part of his thumb. The king was shocked: “Look at this! What has happened? This is a disaster!” He showed the minister “Look what happened to my thumb!” And you know what the minster said? “It’s Krsna’s mercy” The king said, “What? What do you mean it’s Krsna’s mercy? I lost the part of my thumb, how is this Krsna’s mercy?” The minister said, “No, no. It’s Krsna’s mercy.” The king got really disturbed and angry and he told the soldiers, “Lock him up. He is offensive, he is crazy.” So they locked up the minister.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome days later the king’s thumb, it was still bad but he was able to go out hunting again. So out he went, no minister with him, wandering around in the forest but he got lost. He went wandering and wandering, he got arrested by some aboriginal people. He told them, “You can’t arrest me, I am the king!” The aboriginal people said, “You are the king? That’s wonderful! We have been looking for someone like you. We’ve been looking for a good person to make a human sacrifice to Mother Kali. We will sacrifice you. It is an honor.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe king, of course was not very happy. They were preparing him to be sacrificed to Kali and the priest was dressing the king and decorating him, then he noticed: part of his thumb is missing. The priest said, “Oh no, his body is not whole, we cannot offer him to Kali.” They apologized to the king and they let the king go. The king thought, “Wow! That was Krsna’s mercy!” Then he looked at his thumb and he thought, “Yes. What the minister said was right. It was Krsna’s mercy but I couldn’t recognize it. So I locked the minister up. Oh no! What an offense!” And he went running back and released the minister, he was apologizing and apologizing to the minister, “What an offense! I am such a fool! It’s terrible. I am so sorry.” And you know what the minister said, “No, no, no! It was Krsna’s mercy for me.” The king said, “No, it wasn’t Krsna’s mercy, it was my offense.” The minister said, “No, it was Krsna’s mercy for me. I will explain. If you had not locked me up, I would have been out there in the forest with you hunting. I would have been arrested with you, and of course they would not sacrifice you because your body is not whole, but my body is whole so they would have sacrificed me. So you see, it was Krsna’s mercy for me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna is very amazing actually, how He deals with His devotees. Krsna always deals with the sincere devotees to help them to make progress. Even though sometimes to the neophyte eye it may not seem like what Krsna is arranging is really mercy. We should try to see from this perspective and try to understand this point about association that if we can't fit in with the devotees who are Krsna's dear associates then how can we fit in with Krsna?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore Srila Jiva Goswami in Bhakti Sandarbha gives a very interesting, little analysis. He actually is translating the verse spoken by Krsna in the Eleventh Canto of the Bhagavatam. The way he translates is, he says that Krsna is speaking that: “Serving the devotees and developing love for the devotees is a more effective way of developing love for Me than trying to develop love for Me. This is why Srila Prabhupada has created this ISKCON movement, so everybody could get the association of sincere devotees. Someone may be so called this or that, in certain respects more important and someone less, but any sincere devotee, we should know, they are very dear to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was sitting once in class in Bhaktivedanta Manor while Srila Prabhupada was giving class, and he was saying, \"You should be very careful how you associate with the devotee, because you may not really be able to recognize who the devotee is. You don't know. Right now you might be sitting next to Narada Muni.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWell, I'm very fortunate, because I'm sitting next to Niranjana Maharaja and he was giving class and it was just so nice. Really, truly reminding me so much of Srila Prabhupada giving class, particularly if you listen to Srila Prabhupada's classes, the classes he was giving in America in 1966, Prabhupada speaking in such a heartfelt way, with great emotion. You can hear it and feel it so vividly, how he is just appealing to the people and desiring that the people can get the message and get the opportunity. So I was listening to Maharaja and I was remembering that and he was just reminding me so much and I was feeling, “I'm really safe here.”&nbsp; Until I have to start speaking. That's really different.&nbsp; \"Fasten the seat belts.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, thank you all for coming and participating. Thank you very much to Maharaja for giving me his invaluable association. Thank you to Gaura Nitai for giving Their mercy, and thank you to Srila Prabhupada by whose mercy we have got all of this.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada ki! Jaya!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

I am especially happy to be able to be here with His Holiness Bhakti Caitanya Swami. I think all of you should give him a very warm welcome. It is a great privilege for me to be with him. It may appear to be rather bold of me to be speaking before him but we discussed who should speak first and I didn’t tell him this, but I decided that I should probably speak first so that he could correct me after I finish speaking. He is very learned. I am oftentimes amazed at the depth of not only his scholarship but also his wisdom. He is an unlimited ocean full of nectarian pastimes of Krsna in Vrndavan. This is why I wanted to speak first (laughter), because I have the microphone. I am oftentimes in his presence feeling very much dwarfed by his advancement in spiritual life.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(laughing and speaking in Russian referring to Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja’s microphone): It’s not working!\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami, speaking in Russian):”It’s not truth.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNot only is he a GBC godbrother, but he is also this year’s chairman of the GBC. In other words all of the ISKCON matters come directly into his email box every day. He has fulfilled that responsibility so well that this is the second time that he’s been asked to do it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami speaking in Russian): “Please, speak about Krsna.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(Niranjana Swami speaking in Russian): “I am speaking. When I speak about Krsna’s devotee, it is like speaking about Krsna.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami speaking in Russian): “You are talking about a devotee? I am not a devotee”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI will stop. Because I already got my message across, and therefore you fully understand why I won’t speak very long so that he can have the opportunity to enlighten all of us and for that alone I feel very grateful.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was requested today to speak on a particular topic. Often times when I visit the temples I ask the leaders: “What would you like me to speak about?” I won’t tell you what I was asked to speak about but I have chosen the verse that’s connected to the topic. I selected it just a few minutes before coming here and I mentioned it to Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja on the way because he said that he will speak about whatever topic I will speak about.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI am reading a verse from the Srimad Bhagavatam 4.8.34. I will read first the Sanskrit and then the translation and commentary\n</p>\n<p>\n\tgunadhikan mudam lipsed<br />\n\tanukrosam gunadhamat<br />\n\tmaitrim samanad anvicchen<br />\n\tna tapair abhibhuyate\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Every man should act like this: when he meets a person more qualified than himself he should be very pleased. When he meets someone less qualified than himself, he should be compassionate towards him, and when he meets someone equal to himself, he should make friendship with him. In this way one is never affected by the three-fold miseries of this world.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGenerally when we find someone more qualified than ourselves, we become envious of him; when we find someone less qualified, we deride him; and when we find someone equal we become very proud of our activities. These are the causes of all material tribulations. The great sage Narada therefore advised that a devotee should act perfectly. Instead of being envious of a more qualified man, one should be jolly to receive him. Instead of being oppressive to a less qualified man, one should be compassionate toward him just to raise him to the proper standard. And when one meets an equal, instead of being proud of one's own activities before him, one should treat him as a friend. One should also have compassion for the people in general, who are suffering due to forgetfulness of Krsna. These important functions will make one happy within this material world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a very nice verse spoken by Sri Narada Muni to Dhruva Maharaja. He is beginning his instructions to Dhruva in order to prepare him for his purification. Whenever there are instructions given by a saintly person, it is understood that they are meant for the purification of the recipient. Narada Muni is giving an important instruction here, which clearly stated, is meant to help one become unaffected by the miseries of this material world. Most people do not fully understand why they experience misery.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact one of our great acharyas, Srila Sanatana Goswami, taught by his example. When he came in the presence of his superior, the first question he asked was, “Who am I and why do I have to suffer the three-fold miseries?” In other words he was teaching by his example that an intelligent person should try to understand why he is suffering from miseries. He should not look for a temporary solution but should look for something more permanent than treating the symptom. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tOftentimes we may ask ourselves, “Why am I suffering like this?” However, most people will look for a way to relieve the suffering instead of trying to find the root cause of suffering. In their attempt to find more immediate relief they fail to gain the permanent solution. In fact, if we don’t know the root cause of suffering, in our efforts to obtain relief, we may mistake relief for happiness. But the reality is that this relief is the cause of further distress. This is profound if you think about it. Most people will not dig down deep enough to look for the actual cause of suffering. For them, immediate relief is the more suitable solution.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, a five year old boy, Prahlada Maharaja, had something to say in this regard. He said, “In this material world every materialist is endeavouring for happiness and he is trying to mitigate his distress and therefore he is acting accordingly. Actually one cannot be happy as long as he endeavours for happiness; because as soon as he begins his endeavours for happiness, immediately his conditions for distress appear.”  For a five year old boy, that's a profound statement. He is saying that in the material world everyone is trying to be happy and to relieve themselves from distress. And they think, \"If I can achieve some immediate happiness, then I am happy.\" But they don't know the price they have to pay for that temporary relief, and that is: as long as I am only thinking about \"my\" happiness I am creating future distress for myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is the nature of the materialistic person: he's motivated by his own happiness even though he may also be motivated to make others happy. It might seem like that’s selfless. But if he is motivated to make others happy as long as it makes him happy, that is not selfless. Sometimes he may try to make others happy by implicating them in sinful activities which will only be the cause of his own distress. He thinks, “I am making him happy.\" But he becomes implicated himself and thus creates his own future distress.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore an intelligent person should understand what is the root cause of suffering in this world and should seek a solution which will be beneficial for everyone and not just himself. When I think only of my own happiness it might not be necessarily beneficial for others. Unfortunately, the nature of this world is that people will do anything for their own happiness at the expense of others. They may say: “Sorry, I didn’t mean to do it. I didn’t mean to cause you suffering.\" There is an expression in English “That’s the way the cookie crumbles.” It’s a very popular statement in America. In other words, what it really means is, \"You'll just have to accept that’s the way it happened, what can I do?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNarada Muni is here giving instructions to Dhruva Maharaja. Of course this is not the complete set of instructions on how to become free from misery. We can think of many instructions on how to become free from misery. But if we analyze his instruction here, he is telling Dhruva Maharaja how to become free from envy, because envy is a fundamental cause of our suffering in this world. Until one’s heart becomes free from envy then, according to a statement of Prahlada Maharaja in another verse in the Fifth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, one will never be able to think of the welfare of others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs much as one may try to help others or to make others happy, until this envy is completely uprooted from one’s heart, there will always be some tinge of selfish motivation. Therefore this instruction is a very good instruction on how to become unaffected by material miseries and how to become genuinely happy in this world and happiness is definitely something that everybody is aspiring for.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Srimad Bhagavatam states:\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido<br />\n\tna labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah<br />\n\ttal labhyate duhkhavad anyatah sukham<br />\n\tkalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the lowest planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.\" (SB 1.5.18)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAn intelligent person knows that happiness will come, just as miseries come without asking for them. As we have oftentimes explain…nobody makes plans to suffer, nobody asks “How can I be miserable today?” Did anyone wake up in this morning and make plans how to suffer today? An intelligent person doesn’t do that. An intelligent person will think, \"What can I do that’s productive today?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, as Bhagavatam states miseries come without planning for them. I don’t have to make plans for them. They come. An intelligent person also knows that happiness will come in the same way. Therefore an intelligent person endeavors neither for happiness nor distress, specifically speaking about material happiness. However, as far as spiritual happiness is concerned, which is the happiness which satisfies the self, spiritual happiness comes by making efforts to satisfy the Lord and His devotees. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tBhajaniya-parama-purusha-sukha-matra-sva-sukhatvam\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his sandarbhas, Srila Jiva Goswami states that to the degree that we can satisfy the Supreme, to that degree we can also become happy. The benefit of such happiness is that it’s so satisfying to the self that it makes material happiness insignificant, so insignificant that the person who experiences it no longer feels the need to endeavor for it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, wouldn’t it be nice if every one of us had somebody who was always thinking about our happiness, making arrangements for us without us even having to think about how to be happy? Imagine if you had a real good friend who would always watch every single move that you make, always anticipating what he could do so that you could be happy. If they saw any potential obstacle or difficulty that you would confront, they would immediately arrange to mitigate it for you. Wouldn’t you like to have a friend like that? The fact of the matter is: you do. And everybody does. The difficulty is that we have forgotten our connection with Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn so many places Krsna says in the Bhagavad-gita 9.22, if you make endeavors to Me, I will help you. If you always remember Me, I will carry what you lack and I will preserve what you have. If you endeavor to serve Me, I will illuminate transcendental knowledge within your heart, by which you will be able to realize your full potential, your spiritual identity, and become completely free from all identification with suffering within this world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is that everyone of us has a friend within each and every one of our hearts, who wants nothing more than to make arrangements for our happiness. He is ready, He is waiting for us to turn to Him, to recognize Him, and to follow His dictation on how we can come closer to Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore if we want to find the solution to suffering in this world, if we are intelligent, we will try to understand how to establish our connection with our best friend. Our best friend is trying to tell us, through His representatives, manifesting Himself in so many ways by which we can approach Him. And all He is asking is that we serve Him, cultivate and develop our love for Him, remember Him, follow His instructions, serve those who are dear to Him, and glorify Him. In so many ways He’s giving us the means to establish our connection with Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore an intelligent person should try to make that connection strong. The more we can strengthen our connection with Him, our best friend, the more our best friend says that He will relieve us from the miseries of material life. He says to Arjuna, “If you abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me, I will take all those reactions away that you’ve accumulated for millions of births.” Therefore an intelligent person endeavors to serve the Supreme. By making endeavors to serve the Supreme he automatically transcends the happiness and distress of this world. Now, of course we said automatically   it’s not just like that (snapping fingers). It can be like that (snapping fingers). Generally it isn’t. Generally purification of heart has to take place. Srila Rupa Goswami describes,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tiha yasya harer dasye<br />\n\tkarmana manasa gira<br />\n\tnikhilasv apy avasthasu<br />\n\tjivan-muktah sa ucyate\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Anyone who fully engages his mind, his body, his words in the service to Krsna, he is already a liberated soul even while within this material body. “\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA devotee of the Lord does not have to wait until he gives up this body for liberation. He can experience liberation, freedom from suffering, even while within the body. Why? Because Krsna is there, removing all obstacles on his path and satisfying the devotee within his heart, making the devotee so satisfied that he is not even conscious of the sufferings of this world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Srimad Bhagavatam 3.25.23 it is stated,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tmad-asrayah katha mrstah<br />\n\tsrnvanti kathayanti ca\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Engaged constantly in hearing and chanting about Me, those sadhus are not affected by material miseries in this world, because they are always filled with thought of Me” – Lord Kapiladeva says. Of course in the next verse He says\n</p>\n<p>\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi<br />\n\tsarva-sańga-vivarjitah \n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe says to His mother, Devahuti ,\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“O My mother, o virtuous lady, you should seek out the association of saintly persons, become attached to them by hearing from them. When you will become attached it will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachments.” (SB 3.25.24)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is that a devotee must learn how to conduct himself in this world, so that his heart can become purified and free from envy, by knowing how to properly deal with everyone in this world on the spiritual platform. Not on the platform of competition, not on the platform of being envious of the superior or by deriding persons who are not as well off or advanced as ourselves, but by seeing how to properly engage in meaningful relationships with everyone on the spiritual platform, a person can become happy in this world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd now we will hear from Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja who will tell us how to do that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tH. H.Bhakti Caitanya Swami :\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI feel very honored, privileged and embarrassed to be sitting here with Maharaja. Prabhupada talks about the mosquito sitting on the lap of the king, and people are coming and bowing down before the king and the mosquito thinks, “Ha! See, they are bowing down before me!” So that’s my position here.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(speaking in Russian): That’s truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(Niranjana Swami, speaking in Russian): Not truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami, speaking in Russian): It’s truth, 108 percent.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe real reason, from my perspective, why I wanted to speak after Maharaja is because I have nothing to say, but I can pick something up if I listen to Maharaja. He is just so inspired that I can pick some inspiration from him. It’s truth and it’s really, really nice, the association of devotees particularly, special devotees, it’s really very nice.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNear Varsana there is a village with still a quite pleasant kunda, that is called Kisori Kund. One day Srimati Radharani was sitting with her gopi friends and preparing to meet with Krsna, Who was due to come any time. They were in some anxiety, \"He might just walk around the corner right now and we are not quite ready.\" So Srimati Radharani was almost ready except she hadn’t put her anjana on her eyes. You know what I mean, anjana, they call it kajal, it’s the black substance ladies put right on the eye lids.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(speaking in Russian): Do you understand? Good!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo she had put some anjana on one eye and Krsna appeared on the scene and He saw Radharani and of course He is stunned. But then He came right up to Radharani and looking at her and He saw how beautiful and just saturated with devotion she was but she didn’t have anjana on. So Krsna called out, “You are nir-anjana!” Yes. And then Krsna put anjana on Radharani’s eyes. So this place is there. It’s called Anjanoka, and this is called nir-anjana lila. It’s there in the sastra. So niranjana – this is special.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMaharaja was saying so nicely about associating with different types of devotees and different types of people. You know, Srila Prabhupada said that we will have another ISKCON in the spiritual world and we will all be together in the spiritual world. One devotee was telling me, I won’t mention his name, he said that when he heard that, his spontaneous reaction was, he thought of some devotees he had problems with, and he thought, “We're going to be together forever!? Oh no!”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe thing is we have to become such a person, such a devotee, so we can fit in with the other devotees and be at home with the other devotees. It’s one thing to work with someone, oh, you just have to work together, you just may do it. Or, you just meet someone sometimes and you just briefly have to interact in a certain way, but when you share the same home as a person, well you better get on with the people you share the home with. And in Vrndavan, Krsna is at home, Krsna is God at home and Narayana or Vishnu is more like God at work. Vishnu is dealing with all the conditioned souls, He is in the heart of even the greatest demons and most fallen creatures and He does that because it’s like His work you could say. But in Vrndavan, Krsna is God at home. So to go home you have to be that sort of person who Krsna is willing to be at home with. The home is where the heart is. Krsna only lets people into His home if they have really captured His heart. We have to be able to get on with the devotees. At least get on, but actually we should really develop some real affection for the devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne time Narada Muni attended the meeting of all the major holy places. They were having this big debate: which is the king of all of us, the topmost of all the holy places? They were debating and discussing and one holy place was saying, “It’s me!” Another was saying, “No, no, no! It’s me!” In the end they had a vote and Prayag was elected the tirtharaja, or the king of all the holy places. Narada Muni was there and he was witnessing all of this, and at the end he went up and he congratulated Prayag. “You are such a nice holy place, I like to visit you so much” And Prayag said, “Yes, thank you, I feel good about it, but I have one problem: all the holy places here they all respected me, they all accepted me as the king, but where is Vrndavan? Why isn’t Vrndavan here? Why won’t Vrndavan come and accept me as the king? Prayag said “well he associates with Krsna a lot, maybe he got puffed up”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNarada Muni said, “You know, I don’t think it’s like that. I think what you should do is go and ask Krsna.” So Prayag went and he visited Krsna, and he explained that this is the situation: all the holy places respected me but not Vrndavan. Krsna started crying and said, “Vrndavan is not like you. Vrndavan is not just a holy place. Vrndavan is My home and home is where the heart is, so My heart is there in Vrndavan.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVrndavan Dham is unique amongst all the holy places. Krsna only really let’s people into Vrndavan if He feels confident enough, sure enough, “I can let this person have My heart.” Therefore in the Nectar of Devotion, Srila Rupa Goswami explains that Krsna may give material enjoyment, He can easily give impersonal realization, but pure devotional service, particularly on the level of Vrndavan, oh, Krsna is very careful before He gives that!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the 12th chapter of Bhagavad-gita, verses 13 to 20, Krsna explains the characteristics of a person who is very dear to Him. If a person is very humble and kind to others then he is very dear to Him. Krsna gives so many different qualities, which He says, if you have these qualities, you become very dear to Me. So Srila Prabhupada gave one lecture on verses 13 and 14 from that chapter and Srila Prabhupada is making this point that we have to become like that and then Srila Prabhupada says, “Yes, this is Krsna Consciousness. How will Krsna love me? How will I become such a person that Krsna will see me and think: \"There He is! That’s My person, My dear devotee.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is what the process of devotional service is all about. Such an important part of that is how we associate with the devotees. Krsna, before He lets someone into His heart, into Vrndavan, Krsna tests to see: is this person really serious completely? Do they have some other ideas also? Krsna tests the devotees, He is in one sense, you could say, leading the devotees down the path back to His lotus feet, putting devotees through different experiences which will help them to become that sort of person. Sometimes there are tests and we may not appreciate it. But really it is for our benefit and for our development as devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are many interesting stories in this regard and we can mention one.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was a king and he was a devotee something, something, mixed position. He had a minister, they were very close to each other but the minister was really a devotee. The king, of course is a ksatrya, and a traditional ksatrya must keep strong and able to fight. The ksatryas sometimes would go out and hunt animals and this king, he would also do that. One day they were out in the forest and the king was aiming an arrow at some animal and he was just about to fire the arrow but then he slipped. The arrow jumped out of his hand and it cut off the part of his thumb. The king was shocked: “Look at this! What has happened? This is a disaster!” He showed the minister “Look what happened to my thumb!” And you know what the minster said? “It’s Krsna’s mercy” The king said, “What? What do you mean it’s Krsna’s mercy? I lost the part of my thumb, how is this Krsna’s mercy?” The minister said, “No, no. It’s Krsna’s mercy.” The king got really disturbed and angry and he told the soldiers, “Lock him up. He is offensive, he is crazy.” So they locked up the minister.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSome days later the king’s thumb, it was still bad but he was able to go out hunting again. So out he went, no minister with him, wandering around in the forest but he got lost. He went wandering and wandering, he got arrested by some aboriginal people. He told them, “You can’t arrest me, I am the king!” The aboriginal people said, “You are the king? That’s wonderful! We have been looking for someone like you. We’ve been looking for a good person to make a human sacrifice to Mother Kali. We will sacrifice you. It is an honor.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe king, of course was not very happy. They were preparing him to be sacrificed to Kali and the priest was dressing the king and decorating him, then he noticed: part of his thumb is missing. The priest said, “Oh no, his body is not whole, we cannot offer him to Kali.” They apologized to the king and they let the king go. The king thought, “Wow! That was Krsna’s mercy!” Then he looked at his thumb and he thought, “Yes. What the minister said was right. It was Krsna’s mercy but I couldn’t recognize it. So I locked the minister up. Oh no! What an offense!” And he went running back and released the minister, he was apologizing and apologizing to the minister, “What an offense! I am such a fool! It’s terrible. I am so sorry.” And you know what the minister said, “No, no, no! It was Krsna’s mercy for me.” The king said, “No, it wasn’t Krsna’s mercy, it was my offense.” The minister said, “No, it was Krsna’s mercy for me. I will explain. If you had not locked me up, I would have been out there in the forest with you hunting. I would have been arrested with you, and of course they would not sacrifice you because your body is not whole, but my body is whole so they would have sacrificed me. So you see, it was Krsna’s mercy for me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna is very amazing actually, how He deals with His devotees. Krsna always deals with the sincere devotees to help them to make progress. Even though sometimes to the neophyte eye it may not seem like what Krsna is arranging is really mercy. We should try to see from this perspective and try to understand this point about association that if we can't fit in with the devotees who are Krsna's dear associates then how can we fit in with Krsna?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore Srila Jiva Goswami in Bhakti Sandarbha gives a very interesting, little analysis. He actually is translating the verse spoken by Krsna in the Eleventh Canto of the Bhagavatam. The way he translates is, he says that Krsna is speaking that: “Serving the devotees and developing love for the devotees is a more effective way of developing love for Me than trying to develop love for Me. This is why Srila Prabhupada has created this ISKCON movement, so everybody could get the association of sincere devotees. Someone may be so called this or that, in certain respects more important and someone less, but any sincere devotee, we should know, they are very dear to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was sitting once in class in Bhaktivedanta Manor while Srila Prabhupada was giving class, and he was saying, \"You should be very careful how you associate with the devotee, because you may not really be able to recognize who the devotee is. You don't know. Right now you might be sitting next to Narada Muni.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, I'm very fortunate, because I'm sitting next to Niranjana Maharaja and he was giving class and it was just so nice. Really, truly reminding me so much of Srila Prabhupada giving class, particularly if you listen to Srila Prabhupada's classes, the classes he was giving in America in 1966, Prabhupada speaking in such a heartfelt way, with great emotion. You can hear it and feel it so vividly, how he is just appealing to the people and desiring that the people can get the message and get the opportunity. So I was listening to Maharaja and I was remembering that and he was just reminding me so much and I was feeling, “I'm really safe here.”  Until I have to start speaking. That's really different.  \"Fasten the seat belts.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, thank you all for coming and participating. Thank you very much to Maharaja for giving me his invaluable association. Thank you to Gaura Nitai for giving Their mercy, and thank you to Srila Prabhupada by whose mercy we have got all of this.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada ki! Jaya!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna\n</p>\n",

Such transcendental devotees are completely situated in an uncontaminated state of life. By the process of devotional service I shall surely be able to cross the nescient ocean of material existence, which is filled with the waves of blazing, firelike dangers. It will be very easy for me, for I am becoming mad to hear about Your transcendental qualities and pastimes, which are eternally existent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe significant point in Dhruva Maharaja's statement is that he wanted the association of pure devotees. Transcendental devotional service cannot be complete and cannot be relishable without the association of devotees. We have therefore established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Anyone who is trying to be aloof from this Krishna Consciousness Society and yet engage in Krsna consciousness is living in a great hallucination, for this is not possible. From this statement by Dhruva Maharaja it is clear that unless one is associated with devotees, his devotional service does not mature; it does not become distinct from material activities. The Lord says, satam prasangan mama virya-samvido bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah (SB 3.25.25). Only in the association of pure devotees can the words of Lord Krsna be fully potent and relishable to the heart and ear. Dhruva Maharaja explicitly wanted the association of devotees. That association in devotional activities is just like the waves of an incessantly flowing river. In our Krishna Consciousness Society we have full engagement twenty-four hours a day. Every moment of our time is always busily engaged in the service of the Lord. This is called the incessant flow of devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA Mayavadi philosopher may question us, \"You may be very happy in the association of devotees, but what is your plan for crossing the ocean of material existence?\" Dhruva Maharaja's answer is that it is not very difficult. He clearly says that this ocean can be crossed very easily if one simply becomes mad to hear the glories of the Lord. Bhavad-guna-katha: for anyone who persistently engages in hearing the topics of the Lord from Srimad Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam and Caitanya-caritamrta and who is actually addicted to this process, just as one becomes addicted to intoxicants, it is very easy to cross the nescience of material existence. The ocean of material nescience is compared to a blazing fire, but to a devotee this blazing fire is insignificant because he is completely absorbed in devotional service. Although the material world is blazing fire, to a devotee it appears full of pleasure (visvam purna-sukhayate).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe purport of this statement by Dhruva Maharaja is that devotional service in the association of devotees is the cause of the development of further devotional service. By devotional service only is one elevated to the transcendental planet Goloka Vrndavana, and there also there is only devotional service, for the activities of devotional service both in this world and in the spiritual world are one and the same. Devotional service does not change. The example of a mango can be given here. If one gets an unripe mango, it is still a mango, and when it is ripe it remains the same mango, but it has become more tasteful and relishable. Similarly, there is devotional service performed according to the direction of the spiritual master and the injunctions and regulative principles of sastra, and there is devotional service in the spiritual world, rendered directly in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But they are both the same. There is no change. The difference is that one stage is unripe and the other is ripe and more relishable. It is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, yesterday Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja brought us to the point in his introduction to this topic of how Dhruva Maharaja began to speak here in these verses. Now we are hearing in these verses a very important point about the necessity to associate with devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is interesting to note that Dhruva Maharaja here has association with the Lord, but still what is he asking the Lord for? He is asking for the association of devotees. We oftentimes hear such requests from devotees in the presence of the Lord. Upon achieving darshan of the Lord and the opportunity to obtain a benediction from the Lord, the devotee asks for the opportunity to always be in the association of His devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the presence of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Haridasa Thakura requested the Lord for a benediction. Not only did he ask for association of the devotees, but he also begged the Lord to forgive him for asking something further from Him. He said, “Please Lord, I beg that you simply give me the opportunity to take the remnants of foodstuffs from your devotees.” He said, “I know that I am not deserving of such a benediction, and forgive me for my arrogance for asking something so great from You. But I know nothing else.” He expressed that desire to the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, from these examples… the request made by Haridasa Thakura, this prayer of Dhruva Maharaja, and the prayers of so many others devotees who have achieved the darshan of the Lord, they demonstrate by their own example, what they consider to be most important to them. Bhaktivinoda Thakura even prays that better than to take birth as Lord Brahma is that he be given an opportunity to take birth as an insect in a house of the devotee. Therefore, we can appreciate from these examples just how great and important it is to obtain the benediction of the association of the Lord’s devotees. But what is that association? What is Dhruva Maharaja asking for in this verse? He says, “I want to be in association of those devotees who are constantly engaged in describing Your transcendental glories. I am begging from You the opportunity to always hear from these devotees.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Srimad Bhagavatam, Fourth Canto, Narada Muni, in his instructions to King Pracinabarhisat, explains what takes place when one has the opportunity to be in the association of devotees who are possessed of this quality. He says, “In a place, where pure devotees meet, following the rules and regulations, and who are purely conscious, because they are always hankering and eager to discuss and hear about the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which are like a continuous flow of nectar from their mouths… In that place, if one gets a chance to hear the flow of nectar, one will forget about all necessities of life such as hunger and thirst, and one will become free from all kinds of illusion, lamentation and fear.\" Narada Muni is explaining what takes place when devotees come together.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada also speaks about that here in the commentary. He alludes to it in some places, and in some places he is very specific. He is saying that our Krishna consciousness society has been established for this constant flow of devotional activities. He says that association in devotional activities is just like the waves of an incessantly flowing river. In our Krishna consciousness society we have full engagement 24 hours a day. Every moment of our time is always busily engaged in the service of the Lord. This is called the incessant flow of devotional service. Prabhupada is explaining just what one should be looking for when one attains association of devotees. One should be looking for that opportunity, as Prabhupada says here also in this commentary, to make progress on this path. He quotes the verse\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsatam prasangan mama virya-samvido<br />\r\n\tbhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah<br />\r\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani<br />\r\n\tsraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati<br />\r\n\tSB 3.25.25\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the association of devotees discussions of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead become very pleasing to the ear and enter into the heart. As one advances along that path, then what happens? Gradually he loses his attraction for material things and increases his attachment for Krishna. In that state the real devotion and devotional service begins.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe quotes that verse in the commentary, saying that the symptom of real devotional service is when there is attachment for Krishna. That same attachment has to be there for Krishna’s devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tprasangam ajaram pasam<br />\r\n\tatmanah kavayo viduh<br />\r\n\tsa eva sadhusu krto<br />\r\n\tmoksa-dvaram apavrtam<br />\r\n\tSB 3.25.20\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEvery learned person knows that attachment for material things is the cause of bondage for the living entity. But, when that same attachment is applied to self-realized devotees - moksa-dvaram apavrtam - the gate to liberation has become widely open.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada also speaks about this in the commentary. He said, “Mayavadis may ask, oh yes, you are very happy now, you have the association of the devotees, but what is your plan for liberation? You are enjoying now, yes that is very nice, but do you have any plan?” Prabhupada says, “Dhruva Maharaja has a very clear answer to this question of the mayavadis. Yes, my plan is to become attached to hearing the pastimes of the Lord.” Because once one becomes attached to hearing the pastimes of the Lord, everything else naturally follows. Simply by becoming attached…\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada even says, “Like a person, a drug addict becomes addicted to drugs.” The word used in this verse is mattah. Mattah means mad, nunam pramattah, Lord Rishabhadeva explains, mad after sense gratification. He describes the characteristics of persons who are mad after sense gratification. They become addicted to all kinds of sinful activities. Or Prahlada Maharaja also describes the symptoms of such persons who are mad after sense gratification. He says that they make progress towards hellish conditions of life and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed. They make progress too. Everybody makes progress, when you become mad after something. You become mad after sense gratification? Prahlada Maharaja says, “Yes you can make progress towards hellish conditions of life. And you can go on chewing that, which you always had been chewing before and it lost its taste.” He says, “Their inclination towards Krishna is never aroused even by their own efforts, by the efforts of others or by a combination of both.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore Prabhupada explains (he uses this word mattah, which is also presents in this verse in a different way) that in answer to those impersonalists, those mayavadis, who say, “What is your plan?”, the response is, “My plan is to become mad after hearing the topics of Krishna, to become addicted to hearing about Krishna.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Tenth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Sukadeva Goswami says to Pariksit Maharaja. He describes characteristics of paramahamsas, who accepted the essence of life, and who are attached to Lord Krishna within the core of their hearts, and He is the only aim of their life. He says, “It is their nature to speak about the topics of Krishna at every moment, as if they are newer and newer. They are attached to discussing topics of Lord Krishna in the same way as materialists are attached to discussing the topic of women and sex.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the example that Sukadeva Goswami gives. They are addicted, just like a materialist is addicted to sense gratification. Why? because they are always absorbed in these things within the core of their hearts. And because they are always absorbed in these things, whatever they see immediately creates a stimulus for such thoughts. If the heart is filled with lusty desires, there is so much stimulus for lusty thoughts. And from lusty thoughts come lusty topics, from lusty topics come lusty actions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, he explains that they are addicted. Such persons, who are addicted to such topics, mundane topics, they are always discussing these things. But \"paramahamsas, who have accepted the essence of life, are attached to having Lord Krishna within the core of their hearts, and He is the aim of their life.\" That is the characteristic of a devotee of the Lord. For the devotee of the Lord, his aim in life, his progress is “How much am I proceeding along the path to achieve that goal. Am I making progress in spiritual life? Am I actually associating with devotees?”, because association is more than just simple physical proximity. In fact, we are going to talk about this later today.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe started speaking about it yesterday in our talk about \"sanga tyaga\". We were explaining what is bad sanga, but Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura also explains, what is sanga. He says that sanga is not simply physical proximity. There is more to sanga than physical proximity. He gives a beautiful definition of sanga. He quotes Rupa Goswami’s verse from Upadesamrta, dadati pratigrhnati guhyam akhyati prcchati, which means that love is exchanged between devotees by accepting gifts, giving gifts, inquiring confidentially, revealing one‘s mind in confidence, accepting prasadam and giving prasadam.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt‘s not possible to go on to analyze his use of this verse in relationship to association within the few minutes we have left. Nonetheless, he emphasizes the point that sanga begins when these activities are performed with affection. That is sanga, when these activities are performed with the symptoms of love. Symptoms of love and loving exchanges cannot be understood by non-devotees. They can only be understood by devotees; devotees whose aim in life is to please the Supreme Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust as we were explaining yesterday, the jnanis cannot be considered devotees. Why? Because the jnanis are not interested in the mercy of the Lord. Jnanis are thinking, “By my own intelligence, by my knowledge I will achieve perfection. Just as the Supreme has achieved perfection by knowledge, I will achieve the same position.” Therefore they always keep themselves independent from the Supreme, because they think, “I can do it myself.” They keep themselves independent from the mercy of the Lord and the mercy of His devotees, although they may display some small interest in mercy for some time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBhaktivinoda Thakura gives the example. He says, “They may say ‘Yes, give me some mercy’, but their only interest is to achieve their impersonal realization and to deny the personal existence of the Supreme, to merge into the oneness.” So they take it and then they give it up afterwards. “I don‘t need it anymore.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe gave that example of Prabhupada, when he was walking across the ditch. He accepted the hand of the devotee, and then devotee helped him to cross, and then Prabhupada pushed him away. He said this is the mentality of the impersonalists. Impersonalists think, “Yes, let me get mercy from the spiritual master, and then I don‘t need it anymore.” But a devotee is one who knows he is always dependent on mercy. When he gets the mercy of the Lord, what does he ask for? He asks, “Please, give me Your mercy and always keep me in the association of Your devotees. They are the receptacles of Your mercy.” It‘s not that I‘ve achieved the Lord and now it‘s just the Lord and me. No, Prabhupada says, “Devotional service here and devotional service in the spiritual world is the same.” If we want to go to the spiritual world, we better be prepared to associate with devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, the Lord reciprocates in such a way that the devotee sometimes thinks, it‘s only Him and the Lord. But the point is that a devotee understands that “As long as I am here, in this world, I am fully dependent upon Your mercy manifesting in the form of Your devotees. Therefore, please give me the association of those devotees who have this nectar constantly flowing. If I can get caught up in this constant flow of nectar, I may be able even for a few minutes to forget how hungry I am. I may be able to forget how thirsty I am, I may even forget about necessities of life. I may even become free from illusion, temporarily; lamentation, temporarily; fear, maybe temporarily. Therefore, I need that association constantly. I am always dependent.” That is Vaishnava. The Vaishnava knows that he is incessantly, constantly, continuously and always dependent upon the mercy of the Lord and the mercy of the Lord's devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat happens when he becomes greedy, mad? He becomes the receptacle of that mercy. So, Dhruva Maharaja says, “That‘s my plan. You asked me, what my plan is? That‘s my plan. My plan is to always keep myself in the association of Krishna‘s devotees. That‘s all I need.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThank you all very much for your association. Hare Krishna.\r\n</p>\r\n",

But I know nothing else.” He expressed that desire to the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, from these examples… the request made by Haridasa Thakura, this prayer of Dhruva Maharaja, and the prayers of so many others devotees who have achieved the darshan of the Lord, they demonstrate by their own example, what they consider to be most important to them. Bhaktivinoda Thakura even prays that better than to take birth as Lord Brahma is that he be given an opportunity to take birth as an insect in a house of the devotee. Therefore, we can appreciate from these examples just how great and important it is to obtain the benediction of the association of the Lord’s devotees. But what is that association? What is Dhruva Maharaja asking for in this verse? He says, “I want to be in association of those devotees who are constantly engaged in describing Your transcendental glories. I am begging from You the opportunity to always hear from these devotees.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Srimad Bhagavatam, Fourth Canto, Narada Muni, in his instructions to King Pracinabarhisat, explains what takes place when one has the opportunity to be in the association of devotees who are possessed of this quality. He says, “In a place, where pure devotees meet, following the rules and regulations, and who are purely conscious, because they are always hankering and eager to discuss and hear about the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which are like a continuous flow of nectar from their mouths… In that place, if one gets a chance to hear the flow of nectar, one will forget about all necessities of life such as hunger and thirst, and one will become free from all kinds of illusion, lamentation and fear.\" Narada Muni is explaining what takes place when devotees come together.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada also speaks about that here in the commentary. He alludes to it in some places, and in some places he is very specific. He is saying that our Krishna consciousness society has been established for this constant flow of devotional activities. He says that association in devotional activities is just like the waves of an incessantly flowing river. In our Krishna consciousness society we have full engagement 24 hours a day. Every moment of our time is always busily engaged in the service of the Lord. This is called the incessant flow of devotional service. Prabhupada is explaining just what one should be looking for when one attains association of devotees. One should be looking for that opportunity, as Prabhupada says here also in this commentary, to make progress on this path. He quotes the verse\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsatam prasangan mama virya-samvido<br />\n\tbhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah<br />\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani<br />\n\tsraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati<br />\n\tSB 3.25.25\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the association of devotees discussions of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead become very pleasing to the ear and enter into the heart. As one advances along that path, then what happens? Gradually he loses his attraction for material things and increases his attachment for Krishna. In that state the real devotion and devotional service begins.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe quotes that verse in the commentary, saying that the symptom of real devotional service is when there is attachment for Krishna. That same attachment has to be there for Krishna’s devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tprasangam ajaram pasam<br />\n\tatmanah kavayo viduh<br />\n\tsa eva sadhusu krto<br />\n\tmoksa-dvaram apavrtam<br />\n\tSB 3.25.20\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery learned person knows that attachment for material things is the cause of bondage for the living entity. But, when that same attachment is applied to self-realized devotees - moksa-dvaram apavrtam - the gate to liberation has become widely open.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada also speaks about this in the commentary. He said, “Mayavadis may ask, oh yes, you are very happy now, you have the association of the devotees, but what is your plan for liberation? You are enjoying now, yes that is very nice, but do you have any plan?” Prabhupada says, “Dhruva Maharaja has a very clear answer to this question of the mayavadis. Yes, my plan is to become attached to hearing the pastimes of the Lord.” Because once one becomes attached to hearing the pastimes of the Lord, everything else naturally follows. Simply by becoming attached…\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada even says, “Like a person, a drug addict becomes addicted to drugs.” The word used in this verse is mattah. Mattah means mad, nunam pramattah, Lord Rishabhadeva explains, mad after sense gratification. He describes the characteristics of persons who are mad after sense gratification. They become addicted to all kinds of sinful activities. Or Prahlada Maharaja also describes the symptoms of such persons who are mad after sense gratification. He says that they make progress towards hellish conditions of life and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed. They make progress too. Everybody makes progress, when you become mad after something. You become mad after sense gratification? Prahlada Maharaja says, “Yes you can make progress towards hellish conditions of life. And you can go on chewing that, which you always had been chewing before and it lost its taste.” He says, “Their inclination towards Krishna is never aroused even by their own efforts, by the efforts of others or by a combination of both.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore Prabhupada explains (he uses this word mattah, which is also presents in this verse in a different way) that in answer to those impersonalists, those mayavadis, who say, “What is your plan?”, the response is, “My plan is to become mad after hearing the topics of Krishna, to become addicted to hearing about Krishna.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Tenth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Sukadeva Goswami says to Pariksit Maharaja. He describes characteristics of paramahamsas, who accepted the essence of life, and who are attached to Lord Krishna within the core of their hearts, and He is the only aim of their life. He says, “It is their nature to speak about the topics of Krishna at every moment, as if they are newer and newer. They are attached to discussing topics of Lord Krishna in the same way as materialists are attached to discussing the topic of women and sex.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the example that Sukadeva Goswami gives. They are addicted, just like a materialist is addicted to sense gratification. Why? because they are always absorbed in these things within the core of their hearts. And because they are always absorbed in these things, whatever they see immediately creates a stimulus for such thoughts. If the heart is filled with lusty desires, there is so much stimulus for lusty thoughts. And from lusty thoughts come lusty topics, from lusty topics come lusty actions.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, he explains that they are addicted. Such persons, who are addicted to such topics, mundane topics, they are always discussing these things. But \"paramahamsas, who have accepted the essence of life, are attached to having Lord Krishna within the core of their hearts, and He is the aim of their life.\" That is the characteristic of a devotee of the Lord. For the devotee of the Lord, his aim in life, his progress is “How much am I proceeding along the path to achieve that goal. Am I making progress in spiritual life? Am I actually associating with devotees?”, because association is more than just simple physical proximity. In fact, we are going to talk about this later today.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe started speaking about it yesterday in our talk about \"sanga tyaga\". We were explaining what is bad sanga, but Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura also explains, what is sanga. He says that sanga is not simply physical proximity. There is more to sanga than physical proximity. He gives a beautiful definition of sanga. He quotes Rupa Goswami’s verse from Upadesamrta, dadati pratigrhnati guhyam akhyati prcchati, which means that love is exchanged between devotees by accepting gifts, giving gifts, inquiring confidentially, revealing one‘s mind in confidence, accepting prasadam and giving prasadam.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt‘s not possible to go on to analyze his use of this verse in relationship to association within the few minutes we have left. Nonetheless, he emphasizes the point that sanga begins when these activities are performed with affection. That is sanga, when these activities are performed with the symptoms of love. Symptoms of love and loving exchanges cannot be understood by non-devotees. They can only be understood by devotees; devotees whose aim in life is to please the Supreme Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJust as we were explaining yesterday, the jnanis cannot be considered devotees. Why? Because the jnanis are not interested in the mercy of the Lord. Jnanis are thinking, “By my own intelligence, by my knowledge I will achieve perfection. Just as the Supreme has achieved perfection by knowledge, I will achieve the same position.” Therefore they always keep themselves independent from the Supreme, because they think, “I can do it myself.” They keep themselves independent from the mercy of the Lord and the mercy of His devotees, although they may display some small interest in mercy for some time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBhaktivinoda Thakura gives the example. He says, “They may say ‘Yes, give me some mercy’, but their only interest is to achieve their impersonal realization and to deny the personal existence of the Supreme, to merge into the oneness.” So they take it and then they give it up afterwards. “I don‘t need it anymore.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe gave that example of Prabhupada, when he was walking across the ditch. He accepted the hand of the devotee, and then devotee helped him to cross, and then Prabhupada pushed him away. He said this is the mentality of the impersonalists. Impersonalists think, “Yes, let me get mercy from the spiritual master, and then I don‘t need it anymore.” But a devotee is one who knows he is always dependent on mercy. When he gets the mercy of the Lord, what does he ask for? He asks, “Please, give me Your mercy and always keep me in the association of Your devotees. They are the receptacles of Your mercy.” It‘s not that I‘ve achieved the Lord and now it‘s just the Lord and me. No, Prabhupada says, “Devotional service here and devotional service in the spiritual world is the same.” If we want to go to the spiritual world, we better be prepared to associate with devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, the Lord reciprocates in such a way that the devotee sometimes thinks, it‘s only Him and the Lord. But the point is that a devotee understands that “As long as I am here, in this world, I am fully dependent upon Your mercy manifesting in the form of Your devotees. Therefore, please give me the association of those devotees who have this nectar constantly flowing. If I can get caught up in this constant flow of nectar, I may be able even for a few minutes to forget how hungry I am. I may be able to forget how thirsty I am, I may even forget about necessities of life. I may even become free from illusion, temporarily; lamentation, temporarily; fear, maybe temporarily. Therefore, I need that association constantly. I am always dependent.” That is Vaishnava. The Vaishnava knows that he is incessantly, constantly, continuously and always dependent upon the mercy of the Lord and the mercy of the Lord's devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat happens when he becomes greedy, mad? He becomes the receptacle of that mercy. So, Dhruva Maharaja says, “That‘s my plan. You asked me, what my plan is? That‘s my plan. My plan is to always keep myself in the association of Krishna‘s devotees. That‘s all I need.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much for your association. Hare Krishna.\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is a partially edited transcription of a talk given in a \"Sadhaka Class\" on August 19, 2012 in Boston.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] Program me. What would you want me to speak about?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[A devotee:] Hearing and chanting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] Hearing and chanting? Ok. Well, I can think of a verse we can speak from. Maybe you can tell me a little bit, in three minutes or less, how things have evolved since this program has begun?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[A devotee, indistinctly:] We came with that idea in October. I was able to have anyone to help me to run it. The idea is that, first since the time we have started it in October, this process… We have a gradual progression from levels one to four, with level one as a very beginning with only chanting four rounds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] When did it start and at what level it is at present?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Devotee:] This is week three. Week one: we talk basically, what is the Hare Krsna mantra, where it come from, in the Vedas, little bit about the process of chanting, very very basics, what is the meaning of the mantra. We chanted a round together. Week two. We… and chanted again as well. I was going to go to reading. Because part of the process is also reading a chapter of Bhagavad-gita each day. We started this week, reading from Bhagavad-gita, basicly reading from introduction of Bhagavad-gita, with what mood one should read Bhagavad Gita. Example of calf and a cow and so on and so forth. Then about three different parts in Bhagavad-gita. Like that…\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] Okay… When you said, “Hearing and chanting”, it made me think of a verse that I spoke on not a long ago. Somebody else asked me to speak from this verse. So, it’s a good verse about hearing and chanting. Maybe we can just read it and talk about it? It is actually from 11th Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, Chapter 3, Text 30:&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tparasparanukathanam pavanam bhagavad-yasah mitho ratir mithas tustir nivrttir mitha atmanah\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTranslation\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“One should learn how to associate with the devotees of the Lord by gathering with them to chant the glories of the Lord. This process is most purifying. As devotees thus develop their loving friendship, they feel mutual happiness and satisfaction. And by thus encouraging one another they are able to give up material sense gratification, which is the cause of all suffering.” [End of translation.]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA good verse, isn’t it? Yes? You like it? Okay.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Srila Sridhara Svami, those who are advanced in Krsna consciousness should not envy one another or quarrel among themselves. Giving up all such mundane feelings, they should gather together and chant the glories of the Supreme Lord for mutual purification. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has pointed out that glorification of the Supreme Lord is especially potent when performed in the association of pure devotees. When devotees engage in sankirtana, chanting the glories of the Lord together, they experience the highest transcendental bliss and satisfaction. Thus they encourage one another to give up material sense gratification, which is based on illicit sexual connections with women. One devotee will say to another, “Oh, you have given up sense gratification. Starting today, I shall also give it up.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne should learn to increase one’s love for the devotees, to satisfy them and to give up sense objects unfavorable to serving Krsna. And one should learn to view the entire universe as paraphernalia for the Lord’s service. By engaging the objects of the senses in Krsna’s service, one automatically becomes detached from them. And as one passes one’s days in the association of the Lord’s devotees, one’s transcendental ecstasy increases more and more, through discussions about the topics of Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. Therefore, one who wants to be free from the harassment of maya in the form of sense gratification must constantly associate with pure devotees of the Lord who have no engagement other than chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord and carrying out His mission on earth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Madhvacarya has pointed out that just as one should cultivate friendship with devotees, one must cultivate a spirit of friendship toward the demigods, who manage the universe on the Lord’s behalf. Thus one should live peacefully within this world. [End of purport.]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAny questions? I can talk more. I’m just curious if anyone has any questions yet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Devotee:] You said something about carrying out Lords mission… can you explain that?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] At the very end of the commentary, you mean?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Devotee:] Right.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] “Therefore, one who wants to be free from the harassment of&nbsp;maya&nbsp;in the form of sense gratification must constantly associate with pure devotees of the Lord who have no engagement other than chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord and carrying out His mission on earth.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Devotee:] I’m trying to understand “The mission on earth.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] Well, let’s try to answer that question, but include it in the essence of the topic of the verse as well. Krsna comes, obviously, for many purposes. Queen Kunti in her prayers gives many reasons for the Lord’s appearance. Certainly, as He Himself says, He comes to re-establish the principles of religion, paritranaya sadhunam - to deliver the devotees, annihilate the miscreants and re-establish principles of religion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, the Lord has different missions according to different times and according to different circumstances, but we should understand that the mission that is described here, in this commentary, refers to the verse itself. Queen Kunti says that one of the reasons why Krsna appears is to renovate the principles of hearing and chanting about Him, because when He appears in this world, He engages in many wonderful transcendental activities, which are later recorded in the form of scripture and then later discussed by His devotees. When His devotees are discussing His activities, which are always transcendental, it is understood that such topics of the Lord are non-different from the Lord Himself. Therefore, to discuss His transcendental activities is also absolute and has the same potency as if Krsna Himself was present. Therefore, there are verses such as:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnaham tisthami vaikunthe yoginam hrdayesu va tatra tisthami narada yatra gayanti mad-bhaktah\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna says to Narada, “Narada, I am not in the Vaikuntha planets, nor am I in the hearts of yogis, but wherever My devotees are discussing My glories. That’s where I go. That’s where you’ll find Me.” (Padma Purana)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, when the devotees are purely, and here the reference is given in the commentary, when devotees are endeavouring to purely speak of Krsna’s pastimes for no other purpose than to glorify Him. They want to simply hear the topics of the Supreme Lord and glorify the Supreme Lord. They have no other agenda. So when it’s done purely, without any other motivations and free from envy, which is also spoken about in the commentary, Krsna becomes very attracted to that place where such topics are discussed. Therefore, being attracted He says, “I come, I go there. You’ll find Me there. I manifest there.” Therefore Krsna’s purpose, His mission in this world is fulfilled by those devotees who discuss His pastimes and hear them purely. Purity, of course, is a very important quality. Purity means there is no motivation other than to please the Lord. So, how to achieve that state of purity? Bhagavatam also says:&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya vasudeva-katha-rucih syan mahat-sevaya viprah punya-tirtha-nisevanat\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“By serving devotees who are freed from vice, great service is done. By that service one develops attraction for hearing and chanting about Krsna.” (SB 1.2.16)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore we see, for example, Krsna says in the Bhagavad Gita:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tya idam paramam guhyam mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“For one who explains the supreme secret about devotional service to others, for him this devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he comes back to Me. There is no servant in this world that is more dear to Me nor will there ever be one more dear.” (BG 18.68)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna establishes very clearly right in Bhagavad Gita that His mission, mission of those who are most confidential and dear servants, is to tell others about Him. What service can we render to those who are engaged in spreading the glories of the Lord and telling others about Him? The first service, we can render, is hearing from them, because, what is the most important way to serve somebody who is spreading the glories of the Lord? First is hearing. Prabhupada explains: sravanam, kirtanam, visnu smaranam. First is hearing, and when one has heard then what happens?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsatam prasangan mama virya-samvido bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen one hears, it goes into the ear, when it goes into the ear, then it goes into the heart. Then, when it goes into the heart:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt goes into the ear then it goes into the heart. Then one gradually gives up attraction to this material world, his attachment to Krsna becomes fixed and then his devotional service begins. (SB 3.25.25)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, very important service… sometimes people they have this fixed conception in their mind that, when they have heard from somebody, then they need a mission, they need… “What’s my service? What’s my mission? What am I going to do?” They start thinking that mission means doing something with the body. If they don’t go on hearing, then sometimes due to impurities that are still within the heart – anarthas, a lot of anarthas, unwanted things within the heart – if one doesn’t go on hearing, then one can lose sight of the goal of the service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, in this verse, we’ve just quoted, it is stated: sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati, hearing has to be there from sraddha all the way to prema. This hearing is not something that is given up at any stage. From sraddha, which is the beginning - sraddha means that faith is awakened within the heart - to sadhu sanga, associating with the devotees, then to bhajana kriya. Bhajana kriya means engaging in the service or worship. Bhajana kriya specifically means the processes of:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNine processes of devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes we think that bhajana kriya means… Yes, these other things are relevant, the other types of service that one can do: giving donations to the temple, so many other things, unlimited things that one can do. They are purifying and beneficial. But bhajana kriya means to actually engage in one, two, or even all nine processes of devotional service beginning with hearing and chanting. Then what happens after this bhajana kriya, beginning with hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord? The next stage is anartha nivritti.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnartha nivritti means that the anarthas become cleansed from the heart gradually and then... I’ve only got an hour, a little bit more than 40 minutes to spend, so I am not going to give a very, very detailed description, I am giving only a general topic. Then the next stage is nistha. Nistha means that attachment becomes fixed, one becomes convinced. When one comes to that stage of nistha, then gradually one gets ruci, one gets some taste, he extracts some taste, a higher taste and that taste is steady, consistent. Then from the attachment asakti is the next stage, then bhava and then prema.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn all of these stages, from sraddha to prema, pure love of God, there is always hearing about Krsna, except that it becomes deeper, it becomes thicker, it becomes more relishable, and therefore devotees never give up this process of hearing and chanting. But most important in the beginning stage, there must be hearing. That is devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes people who are too much motivated think that, “I am going to do something really big so that I can get somebody’s attention. I’ve got to do something that shows the big results, big this, big that”. They get so much into thinking of the results, of the big thing. But the real big result is supposed to take place right here, in the heart. That’s the big result that we are actually supposed to offer-- it is a clean heart. Because when there is a clean heart, then one becomes very potent, and one can actually become very instrumental to the Lord’s mission. Very instrumental… When the heart is clean, pure. So, how is it going to be clean?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya vasudeva-katha-rucih (SB 1.2.16)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe have to serve devotees who are freed from vice. Then great service is done. By that service we develop an affinity for hearing more and more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo yes, we should go on and do service to the devotees who are freed from vice. We should assist them in their mission, which is spreading the glories of the Lord. But also we should not neglect that all these services are supposed to awaken our attraction for hearing about Krsna, without which srama eva hi kevalam (SB 1.2.8) we are wasting our time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt’s said in the Bhagavatam :\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tdharmah svanusthitah pumsam visvaksena-kathasu yah notpadayed yadi ratim srama eva hi kevalam\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe verse basically says that even if one engages in his occupational duties but he doesn’t awaken attraction to hearing and chanting, then he is wasting his time, srama eva hi kevalam.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat is the Lord’s mission, and those who are sincere servants of the Lord they continue His mission by discussing His activities and pastimes in this world in the association of others, who are eager to hear such transcendental narrations. The more one goes on hearing the more that desire is awakened within the heart to tell others, and then the Lord's mission continues. So that is the Lord’s mission, and that’s how it’s applied in a very general way to the process of hearing and chanting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore we’ve tried to place emphasis on a very important point that at no stage from sraddha – the very first stage – all the way to ecstatic love of God, manifesting in all the asta-sattvika bhavas, at no stage does one ever neglect hearing about Krsna. Because, those persons who are situated on the topmost platform of devotional service,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tprayena munayo rajan nivrtta vidhi-sedhatah nairgunya-stha ramante sma gunanukathane hareh\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe topmost transcendentalists, Bhagavatam states, the topmost transcendentalists derive their greatest pleasure from always hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. That’s their ecstasy, that’s their bliss. Obviously Krsna is very pleased by their state of consciousness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, even when one comes to the topmost stage, hearing and chanting goes on. What to speak of the beginning stage, when the heart is still filled with so many unwanted things? What is going to clean it? And that’s what this verse is all about: “One should learn how to associate with the devotees of the Lord by gathering with them to chant the glories of the Lord. This process is most purifying.” Not even said ‘more pure’, it’s most purifying!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs devotees develop their loving friendship, they feel mutual happiness and satisfaction. When devotees get together to discuss, then they actually begin to experience what is the real basis of friendship amongst devotees. It’s not physical proximity, it’s not working together. Sometimes we say, “Yes, I’m with devotees all the time. I am up here, she is over there, he is over there, they are over there, we are in the same building together, and every time we cross, we think how to avoid each other. But I am always associating with devotees!” No, association is not a physical proximity. If association would mean physical proximity, we’d all be pretty pure! It’s not just physical proximity, it’s more to it than that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes devotees say, “Yes, I work with devotees in the same place. We do the same business together”, and things like that. But what do they talk about? They talk about taxes; they talk about profit, this and that. Yes, there is some association, but what is association? Association is mac-citta mad-gata-prana bodhayantah parasparam (Bg10.9) hearing and discussing topics related to Lord Krsna. That is association. Therefore, when one actually begins to associate on this platform, then the whole paradigm of day to day identifying with one another according to the different roles we play in the material world, the whole paradigm gets smashed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe tend to see people according to the roles we play in social intercourse. If we're not careful, we start thinking, “He does this, he does that. I don’t like the way he does that, I don’t like the way she does this”, and we start categorizing people according to the habits we don’t like about them. Because we play different social roles and because the material world is not completely harmonious, we become disharmonious. We avoid doing anything together which would break down this barrier, and which would allow us to see each other as a servant of Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat allows us to see each other for who we really are (or should be) is seeing others as devotees who want to become purified by the process of hearing and chanting about Krsna. When we associate with each other on that platform, it is very purifying. What happens is that friendship begins to strengthen, there is a bonding because there is communality between everybody. “Yes, we are all in this together. We are all in this together! We are all trying to become purified by hearing and chanting about Krsna.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, in the commentary it says, “According to Srila Sridhar Swami, those who are advanced in Krsna consciousness should not envy one another or quarrel among themselves. Giving up all such mundane feelings, they should gather together and chant the glories of the Supreme Lord for mutual purification.” Here it is in a nutshell! He said, “Give up all these mundane feelings, ‘He did this, she said that, I don’t like the way he did this, I don’t like to listen… Well I’m doing all this, and what is she doing? I am working so hard but they are just not doing anything.’” All these different attitudes build up, and as soon as you see somebody the only thing you see is the attitude, because you don’t see anything else. You see your own attitude towards them and that’s what happens.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada says, “Familiarity breeds contempt.” Prabhupada even said that about his own disciple who was very close to him. He said, “Actually he became too familiar, and familiarity breeds contempt.” And what happens? In the same way you become too familiar and start thinking, “They are ordinary people, they are doing…” and then you don’t want to associate with them anymore. But when you associate with each other by hearing and chanting, these feelings can be put aside because there's a higher goal, a higher objective. Not only that, it’s purifying. It’s very purifying. And what comes out is the feeling like, “Wow, there is some benefit being around these people. I don’t have to hide in my room all the time and try to avoid them in the hallway.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, there is so much emphasis, “Yes, come to class!” – “No, not to class. I am too busy doing this, doing that.” “No, this is it. This is what it is all for – to sit in front of Radha-Gopivallabha and hear and chant about Them, that’s what it’s all about, that’s what the building is here for, otherwise what’s the value?” It’s not here to run around, working hard, doing this, doing that and forgetting the whole goal. So, this is the importance of being a sadhaka and actually putting emphasis on hearing and chanting. And I think my time is up...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Devotee:] (indistinct)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] But this is what association means. This is actually supposed to awaken an inspiration, not pain. It is painful, because… What is it? What is it, the verse? Rupa Goswami, “Upadesamrita”, verse Seven:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Holy Name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are all naturally sweet, but one who has been afflicted by the jaundice of avidya tastes it as very bitter. Therefore it’s very wonderful that if one goes on very carefully chanting these sweet names of the Lord, very carefully chanting every day, then a natural relish awakens within the tongue and the disease becomes destroyed at the root.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo it is painful sometimes. Like a person who has jaundice – it’s painful to eat sugar. Therefore, we are all in the same condition. It’s not that anyone is exempt. We are all in the same condition. It’s painful for all of us. But if we stay fixed on what is the purpose, what is the goal, why did I come, why was I attracted to Prabhupada’s books, why was I attracted to visiting the temple, why was I attracted in the first place, we'll remember why we are here. If we are not careful we may forget, very easily forget, because that’s the nature of the material world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, daily hearing and chanting about Krsna is supposed to serve as a constant reminder, and in the beginning stages it is a process of purification, but gradually, as one advances on the path, it becomes very relishable. And relish - that is of course, as we said, in the more advanced stages of relishing that sweet taste of Krsna’s name, form, qualities and pastimes, but it works. It works, when the motive is correct.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI remember seeing sometimes in the temples that had strict policies requiring all residents to attend class, that some devotees would come, but resentfully. They would make sure they were busy doing something else during class so that they didn’t have to hear. But since their bodies were there, nobody challenged them. “I’m here, I’m in the temple room,” – but they are doing something else, their mind is not even… Don’t want to hear, stubborn, just stubborn, don’t want to hear... Their excuse is, “It’s not inspiring. I am not inspired to hear this person.” But here is a very interesting point; it’s brought out here in the purport. It says that devotees gather for mutual purification. Everybody comes for the same reason… wanting to hear, but can also discuss.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf we actually have a desire to hear something, we may actually hear something from somebody who not necessarily may be such an inspirational speaker, but it may resonate with something that we really have a strong desire for. A part of our bhajan, a part of our daily service is supposed to be praying for answers, to increase our understanding. Krsna is within the heart. Sometimes He can arrange for a very profound message to come from somebody else’s mouth that you never even expected it to come from. Because we desired it, Krsna arranged it to come from somebody else’s mouth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI’ve had that situation. Sometimes I’ve heard things from a non-devotee, and it was profound, completely profound! It really just depends on our earnest and fervent desire to catch something that is relevant to our spiritual life. It’s also based upon our own desire to hear, to find answers and to get inspiration. So, again, it is not just the principle of being physically present. It’s also hearing and cultivating the desire to hear more and more for the purpose of increasing our attachment to the lotus feet of the Lord. The result from having adequately heard is that the desire to serve the Lord becomes naturally awakened within the heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat’s all on the process of hearing and chanting. And we are supposed to chant japa together, right? One round together and then end at eleven o’clock. Should we see if anyone else has any question? Is this painful for everyone?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Another devotee:] (not clear) What happens is that we get lost in a mundane way of doing things. We begin with intense chanting. And then it does happen in fact, while chanting and while listening, it becomes mundane. It becomes mundane, it becomes routine. So when it becomes routine, at that point you can move all the… The factors of doing it. Because then it becomes .... you are simply looking for something else and your Hare Krsna japa is ruined...&nbsp; So you are returning from Himalayas... You have to get back on to focusing on that, on mantra.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] In other words, you are just confirming what I said?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Another devotee:] Exactly. It’s natural.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[NRS:] Of course, it happens to everybody. Why do you think I am able to speak about it so distinctly? But we have to at least be aware of it. One of the anarthas is not to be aware of the pitfalls of devotional service. It’s called tattva-vibrahma. It’s an anartha. It’s not to know, what the pitfalls are and to stay ignorant of it. The best way to clear that anartha is to know what are the pitfalls so that we can consciously try to avoid them while engaged in sadhana.&nbsp; Therefore, sometimes we have to bring out these painful topics.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOkay. Hare Krsna. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. I guess we chant japa now, one round.\r\n</p>\r\n",

What would you want me to speak about?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[A devotee:] Hearing and chanting.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] Hearing and chanting? Ok. Well, I can think of a verse we can speak from. Maybe you can tell me a little bit, in three minutes or less, how things have evolved since this program has begun?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[A devotee, indistinctly:] We came with that idea in October. I was able to have anyone to help me to run it. The idea is that, first since the time we have started it in October, this process… We have a gradual progression from levels one to four, with level one as a very beginning with only chanting four rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] When did it start and at what level it is at present?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Devotee:] This is week three. Week one: we talk basically, what is the Hare Krsna mantra, where it come from, in the Vedas, little bit about the process of chanting, very very basics, what is the meaning of the mantra. We chanted a round together. Week two. We… and chanted again as well. I was going to go to reading. Because part of the process is also reading a chapter of Bhagavad-gita each day. We started this week, reading from Bhagavad-gita, basicly reading from introduction of Bhagavad-gita, with what mood one should read Bhagavad Gita. Example of calf and a cow and so on and so forth. Then about three different parts in Bhagavad-gita. Like that…\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] Okay… When you said, “Hearing and chanting”, it made me think of a verse that I spoke on not a long ago. Somebody else asked me to speak from this verse. So, it’s a good verse about hearing and chanting. Maybe we can just read it and talk about it? It is actually from 11th Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, Chapter 3, Text 30: \n</p>\n<p>\n\tparasparanukathanam pavanam bhagavad-yasah mitho ratir mithas tustir nivrttir mitha atmanah\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTranslation\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“One should learn how to associate with the devotees of the Lord by gathering with them to chant the glories of the Lord. This process is most purifying. As devotees thus develop their loving friendship, they feel mutual happiness and satisfaction. And by thus encouraging one another they are able to give up material sense gratification, which is the cause of all suffering.” [End of translation.]\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA good verse, isn’t it? Yes? You like it? Okay.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Srila Sridhara Svami, those who are advanced in Krsna consciousness should not envy one another or quarrel among themselves. Giving up all such mundane feelings, they should gather together and chant the glories of the Supreme Lord for mutual purification. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has pointed out that glorification of the Supreme Lord is especially potent when performed in the association of pure devotees. When devotees engage in sankirtana, chanting the glories of the Lord together, they experience the highest transcendental bliss and satisfaction. Thus they encourage one another to give up material sense gratification, which is based on illicit sexual connections with women. One devotee will say to another, “Oh, you have given up sense gratification. Starting today, I shall also give it up.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne should learn to increase one’s love for the devotees, to satisfy them and to give up sense objects unfavorable to serving Krsna. And one should learn to view the entire universe as paraphernalia for the Lord’s service. By engaging the objects of the senses in Krsna’s service, one automatically becomes detached from them. And as one passes one’s days in the association of the Lord’s devotees, one’s transcendental ecstasy increases more and more, through discussions about the topics of Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. Therefore, one who wants to be free from the harassment of maya in the form of sense gratification must constantly associate with pure devotees of the Lord who have no engagement other than chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord and carrying out His mission on earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Madhvacarya has pointed out that just as one should cultivate friendship with devotees, one must cultivate a spirit of friendship toward the demigods, who manage the universe on the Lord’s behalf. Thus one should live peacefully within this world. [End of purport.]\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAny questions? I can talk more. I’m just curious if anyone has any questions yet.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Devotee:] You said something about carrying out Lords mission… can you explain that?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] At the very end of the commentary, you mean?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Devotee:] Right.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] “Therefore, one who wants to be free from the harassment of maya in the form of sense gratification must constantly associate with pure devotees of the Lord who have no engagement other than chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord and carrying out His mission on earth.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Devotee:] I’m trying to understand “The mission on earth.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] Well, let’s try to answer that question, but include it in the essence of the topic of the verse as well. Krsna comes, obviously, for many purposes. Queen Kunti in her prayers gives many reasons for the Lord’s appearance. Certainly, as He Himself says, He comes to re-establish the principles of religion, paritranaya sadhunam - to deliver the devotees, annihilate the miscreants and re-establish principles of religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, the Lord has different missions according to different times and according to different circumstances, but we should understand that the mission that is described here, in this commentary, refers to the verse itself. Queen Kunti says that one of the reasons why Krsna appears is to renovate the principles of hearing and chanting about Him, because when He appears in this world, He engages in many wonderful transcendental activities, which are later recorded in the form of scripture and then later discussed by His devotees. When His devotees are discussing His activities, which are always transcendental, it is understood that such topics of the Lord are non-different from the Lord Himself. Therefore, to discuss His transcendental activities is also absolute and has the same potency as if Krsna Himself was present. Therefore, there are verses such as:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tnaham tisthami vaikunthe yoginam hrdayesu va tatra tisthami narada yatra gayanti mad-bhaktah\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna says to Narada, “Narada, I am not in the Vaikuntha planets, nor am I in the hearts of yogis, but wherever My devotees are discussing My glories. That’s where I go. That’s where you’ll find Me.” (Padma Purana)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, when the devotees are purely, and here the reference is given in the commentary, when devotees are endeavouring to purely speak of Krsna’s pastimes for no other purpose than to glorify Him. They want to simply hear the topics of the Supreme Lord and glorify the Supreme Lord. They have no other agenda. So when it’s done purely, without any other motivations and free from envy, which is also spoken about in the commentary, Krsna becomes very attracted to that place where such topics are discussed. Therefore, being attracted He says, “I come, I go there. You’ll find Me there. I manifest there.” Therefore Krsna’s purpose, His mission in this world is fulfilled by those devotees who discuss His pastimes and hear them purely. Purity, of course, is a very important quality. Purity means there is no motivation other than to please the Lord. So, how to achieve that state of purity? Bhagavatam also says: \n</p>\n<p>\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya vasudeva-katha-rucih syan mahat-sevaya viprah punya-tirtha-nisevanat\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“By serving devotees who are freed from vice, great service is done. By that service one develops attraction for hearing and chanting about Krsna.” (SB 1.2.16)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore we see, for example, Krsna says in the Bhagavad Gita:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tya idam paramam guhyam mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“For one who explains the supreme secret about devotional service to others, for him this devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he comes back to Me. There is no servant in this world that is more dear to Me nor will there ever be one more dear.” (BG 18.68)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna establishes very clearly right in Bhagavad Gita that His mission, mission of those who are most confidential and dear servants, is to tell others about Him. What service can we render to those who are engaged in spreading the glories of the Lord and telling others about Him? The first service, we can render, is hearing from them, because, what is the most important way to serve somebody who is spreading the glories of the Lord? First is hearing. Prabhupada explains: sravanam, kirtanam, visnu smaranam. First is hearing, and when one has heard then what happens?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsatam prasangan mama virya-samvido bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen one hears, it goes into the ear, when it goes into the ear, then it goes into the heart. Then, when it goes into the heart:\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt goes into the ear then it goes into the heart. Then one gradually gives up attraction to this material world, his attachment to Krsna becomes fixed and then his devotional service begins. (SB 3.25.25)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, very important service… sometimes people they have this fixed conception in their mind that, when they have heard from somebody, then they need a mission, they need… “What’s my service? What’s my mission? What am I going to do?” They start thinking that mission means doing something with the body. If they don’t go on hearing, then sometimes due to impurities that are still within the heart – anarthas, a lot of anarthas, unwanted things within the heart – if one doesn’t go on hearing, then one can lose sight of the goal of the service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, in this verse, we’ve just quoted, it is stated: sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati, hearing has to be there from sraddha all the way to prema. This hearing is not something that is given up at any stage. From sraddha, which is the beginning - sraddha means that faith is awakened within the heart - to sadhu sanga, associating with the devotees, then to bhajana kriya. Bhajana kriya means engaging in the service or worship. Bhajana kriya specifically means the processes of:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNine processes of devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes we think that bhajana kriya means… Yes, these other things are relevant, the other types of service that one can do: giving donations to the temple, so many other things, unlimited things that one can do. They are purifying and beneficial. But bhajana kriya means to actually engage in one, two, or even all nine processes of devotional service beginning with hearing and chanting. Then what happens after this bhajana kriya, beginning with hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord? The next stage is anartha nivritti.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnartha nivritti means that the anarthas become cleansed from the heart gradually and then... I’ve only got an hour, a little bit more than 40 minutes to spend, so I am not going to give a very, very detailed description, I am giving only a general topic. Then the next stage is nistha. Nistha means that attachment becomes fixed, one becomes convinced. When one comes to that stage of nistha, then gradually one gets ruci, one gets some taste, he extracts some taste, a higher taste and that taste is steady, consistent. Then from the attachment asakti is the next stage, then bhava and then prema.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn all of these stages, from sraddha to prema, pure love of God, there is always hearing about Krsna, except that it becomes deeper, it becomes thicker, it becomes more relishable, and therefore devotees never give up this process of hearing and chanting. But most important in the beginning stage, there must be hearing. That is devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes people who are too much motivated think that, “I am going to do something really big so that I can get somebody’s attention. I’ve got to do something that shows the big results, big this, big that”. They get so much into thinking of the results, of the big thing. But the real big result is supposed to take place right here, in the heart. That’s the big result that we are actually supposed to offer-- it is a clean heart. Because when there is a clean heart, then one becomes very potent, and one can actually become very instrumental to the Lord’s mission. Very instrumental… When the heart is clean, pure. So, how is it going to be clean?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya vasudeva-katha-rucih (SB 1.2.16)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have to serve devotees who are freed from vice. Then great service is done. By that service we develop an affinity for hearing more and more.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo yes, we should go on and do service to the devotees who are freed from vice. We should assist them in their mission, which is spreading the glories of the Lord. But also we should not neglect that all these services are supposed to awaken our attraction for hearing about Krsna, without which srama eva hi kevalam (SB 1.2.8) we are wasting our time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s said in the Bhagavatam :\n</p>\n<p>\n\tdharmah svanusthitah pumsam visvaksena-kathasu yah notpadayed yadi ratim srama eva hi kevalam\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe verse basically says that even if one engages in his occupational duties but he doesn’t awaken attraction to hearing and chanting, then he is wasting his time, srama eva hi kevalam.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is the Lord’s mission, and those who are sincere servants of the Lord they continue His mission by discussing His activities and pastimes in this world in the association of others, who are eager to hear such transcendental narrations. The more one goes on hearing the more that desire is awakened within the heart to tell others, and then the Lord's mission continues. So that is the Lord’s mission, and that’s how it’s applied in a very general way to the process of hearing and chanting.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t \n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore we’ve tried to place emphasis on a very important point that at no stage from sraddha – the very first stage – all the way to ecstatic love of God, manifesting in all the asta-sattvika bhavas, at no stage does one ever neglect hearing about Krsna. Because, those persons who are situated on the topmost platform of devotional service,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tprayena munayo rajan nivrtta vidhi-sedhatah nairgunya-stha ramante sma gunanukathane hareh\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe topmost transcendentalists, Bhagavatam states, the topmost transcendentalists derive their greatest pleasure from always hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. That’s their ecstasy, that’s their bliss. Obviously Krsna is very pleased by their state of consciousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, even when one comes to the topmost stage, hearing and chanting goes on. What to speak of the beginning stage, when the heart is still filled with so many unwanted things? What is going to clean it? And that’s what this verse is all about: “One should learn how to associate with the devotees of the Lord by gathering with them to chant the glories of the Lord. This process is most purifying.” Not even said ‘more pure’, it’s most purifying!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs devotees develop their loving friendship, they feel mutual happiness and satisfaction. When devotees get together to discuss, then they actually begin to experience what is the real basis of friendship amongst devotees. It’s not physical proximity, it’s not working together. Sometimes we say, “Yes, I’m with devotees all the time. I am up here, she is over there, he is over there, they are over there, we are in the same building together, and every time we cross, we think how to avoid each other. But I am always associating with devotees!” No, association is not a physical proximity. If association would mean physical proximity, we’d all be pretty pure! It’s not just physical proximity, it’s more to it than that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes devotees say, “Yes, I work with devotees in the same place. We do the same business together”, and things like that. But what do they talk about? They talk about taxes; they talk about profit, this and that. Yes, there is some association, but what is association? Association is mac-citta mad-gata-prana bodhayantah parasparam (Bg10.9) hearing and discussing topics related to Lord Krsna. That is association. Therefore, when one actually begins to associate on this platform, then the whole paradigm of day to day identifying with one another according to the different roles we play in the material world, the whole paradigm gets smashed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe tend to see people according to the roles we play in social intercourse. If we're not careful, we start thinking, “He does this, he does that. I don’t like the way he does that, I don’t like the way she does this”, and we start categorizing people according to the habits we don’t like about them. Because we play different social roles and because the material world is not completely harmonious, we become disharmonious. We avoid doing anything together which would break down this barrier, and which would allow us to see each other as a servant of Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat allows us to see each other for who we really are (or should be) is seeing others as devotees who want to become purified by the process of hearing and chanting about Krsna. When we associate with each other on that platform, it is very purifying. What happens is that friendship begins to strengthen, there is a bonding because there is communality between everybody. “Yes, we are all in this together. We are all in this together! We are all trying to become purified by hearing and chanting about Krsna.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, in the commentary it says, “According to Srila Sridhar Swami, those who are advanced in Krsna consciousness should not envy one another or quarrel among themselves. Giving up all such mundane feelings, they should gather together and chant the glories of the Supreme Lord for mutual purification.” Here it is in a nutshell! He said, “Give up all these mundane feelings, ‘He did this, she said that, I don’t like the way he did this, I don’t like to listen… Well I’m doing all this, and what is she doing? I am working so hard but they are just not doing anything.’” All these different attitudes build up, and as soon as you see somebody the only thing you see is the attitude, because you don’t see anything else. You see your own attitude towards them and that’s what happens.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada says, “Familiarity breeds contempt.” Prabhupada even said that about his own disciple who was very close to him. He said, “Actually he became too familiar, and familiarity breeds contempt.” And what happens? In the same way you become too familiar and start thinking, “They are ordinary people, they are doing…” and then you don’t want to associate with them anymore. But when you associate with each other by hearing and chanting, these feelings can be put aside because there's a higher goal, a higher objective. Not only that, it’s purifying. It’s very purifying. And what comes out is the feeling like, “Wow, there is some benefit being around these people. I don’t have to hide in my room all the time and try to avoid them in the hallway.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, there is so much emphasis, “Yes, come to class!” – “No, not to class. I am too busy doing this, doing that.” “No, this is it. This is what it is all for – to sit in front of Radha-Gopivallabha and hear and chant about Them, that’s what it’s all about, that’s what the building is here for, otherwise what’s the value?” It’s not here to run around, working hard, doing this, doing that and forgetting the whole goal. So, this is the importance of being a sadhaka and actually putting emphasis on hearing and chanting. And I think my time is up...\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Devotee:] (indistinct)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] But this is what association means. This is actually supposed to awaken an inspiration, not pain. It is painful, because… What is it? What is it, the verse? Rupa Goswami, “Upadesamrita”, verse Seven:\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Holy Name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are all naturally sweet, but one who has been afflicted by the jaundice of avidya tastes it as very bitter. Therefore it’s very wonderful that if one goes on very carefully chanting these sweet names of the Lord, very carefully chanting every day, then a natural relish awakens within the tongue and the disease becomes destroyed at the root.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is painful sometimes. Like a person who has jaundice – it’s painful to eat sugar. Therefore, we are all in the same condition. It’s not that anyone is exempt. We are all in the same condition. It’s painful for all of us. But if we stay fixed on what is the purpose, what is the goal, why did I come, why was I attracted to Prabhupada’s books, why was I attracted to visiting the temple, why was I attracted in the first place, we'll remember why we are here. If we are not careful we may forget, very easily forget, because that’s the nature of the material world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, daily hearing and chanting about Krsna is supposed to serve as a constant reminder, and in the beginning stages it is a process of purification, but gradually, as one advances on the path, it becomes very relishable. And relish - that is of course, as we said, in the more advanced stages of relishing that sweet taste of Krsna’s name, form, qualities and pastimes, but it works. It works, when the motive is correct.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI remember seeing sometimes in the temples that had strict policies requiring all residents to attend class, that some devotees would come, but resentfully. They would make sure they were busy doing something else during class so that they didn’t have to hear. But since their bodies were there, nobody challenged them. “I’m here, I’m in the temple room,” – but they are doing something else, their mind is not even… Don’t want to hear, stubborn, just stubborn, don’t want to hear... Their excuse is, “It’s not inspiring. I am not inspired to hear this person.” But here is a very interesting point; it’s brought out here in the purport. It says that devotees gather for mutual purification. Everybody comes for the same reason… wanting to hear, but can also discuss. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we actually have a desire to hear something, we may actually hear something from somebody who not necessarily may be such an inspirational speaker, but it may resonate with something that we really have a strong desire for. A part of our bhajan, a part of our daily service is supposed to be praying for answers, to increase our understanding. Krsna is within the heart. Sometimes He can arrange for a very profound message to come from somebody else’s mouth that you never even expected it to come from. Because we desired it, Krsna arranged it to come from somebody else’s mouth.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI’ve had that situation. Sometimes I’ve heard things from a non-devotee, and it was profound, completely profound! It really just depends on our earnest and fervent desire to catch something that is relevant to our spiritual life. It’s also based upon our own desire to hear, to find answers and to get inspiration. So, again, it is not just the principle of being physically present. It’s also hearing and cultivating the desire to hear more and more for the purpose of increasing our attachment to the lotus feet of the Lord. The result from having adequately heard is that the desire to serve the Lord becomes naturally awakened within the heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s all on the process of hearing and chanting. And we are supposed to chant japa together, right? One round together and then end at eleven o’clock. Should we see if anyone else has any question? Is this painful for everyone?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Another devotee:] (not clear) What happens is that we get lost in a mundane way of doing things. We begin with intense chanting. And then it does happen in fact, while chanting and while listening, it becomes mundane. It becomes mundane, it becomes routine. So when it becomes routine, at that point you can move all the… The factors of doing it. Because then it becomes .... you are simply looking for something else and your Hare Krsna japa is ruined...  So you are returning from Himalayas... You have to get back on to focusing on that, on mantra.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] In other words, you are just confirming what I said?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Another devotee:] Exactly. It’s natural.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[NRS:] Of course, it happens to everybody. Why do you think I am able to speak about it so distinctly? But we have to at least be aware of it. One of the anarthas is not to be aware of the pitfalls of devotional service. It’s called tattva-vibrahma. It’s an anartha. It’s not to know, what the pitfalls are and to stay ignorant of it. The best way to clear that anartha is to know what are the pitfalls so that we can consciously try to avoid them while engaged in sadhana.  Therefore, sometimes we have to bring out these painful topics.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay. Hare Krsna. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. I guess we chant japa now, one round.\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tThe following is a partially edited transcription of a lecture delivered on August 1, 2013 in St. Petersburg, Russia from the \"Teachings of Queen Kunti\" on the chapter entitled \"Bewildering Pastimes\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI am happy to be here with all of you today. I haven’t been here in St. Petersburg for eight years. I used to make an annual pilgrimage here which began twenty-five years ago. I've been away too long. I am relieved. I'm very fond of coming here. As soon as I got out of the airport and began driving through the streets, I began reflecting on those memories. Not all of them were good, some were difficult, some were funny - like my confrontation with a KGB agent. It was here in Leningrad in 1989. He grabbed my scarf, started tightening it around my neck and said, “Are you an anarchist?” I replied “I do tend to be a little independent at times.Why do you ask?” He made some kind of remark like, “People who wear purple scarves in the Soviet Union are anarchists.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt that time I didn’t know that this wasn’t true, but he was tightening the scarf around my neck. He then stopped, threw it in my face and said, “We’ll be watching you.” But that was the last day of my tour. I was flying from Leningrad to Warsaw. He didn’t bother me anymore after that. I wasn’t here. But it was one of my memories here. Most of them were very memorable. Different places I preached in, different halls and different flats I preached in and especially the devotees I met - I have fond memories of all of them. I hope to see some of them here as I do – Gargacharya Prabhu, Sri Nathaji Prabhu, who were here back in those days. Who else?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThank you for receiving me. I’m going to do a bit of speaking from the Teachings of Queen Kunti. For several weeks I’ve been speaking from this book. From time to time I like to read and speak from it. In some of the places I’ve been travelling to, I shared my reasons for my attraction to the lectures from this book. I’ll share some of them with you today. I do it only because I feel that I want to increase you appreciation for these lectures that Srila Prabhupada gave in the early 1970's in Los Angeles. Of course, all of his lectures are brilliant and deeply devotional but these particular lectures had a very deep impression on me because Prabhupada was giving them at the same time I started coming to the Krsna consciousness movement.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada was speaking from the prayers of Queen Kunti from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1. Every day he would speak from a verse from these prayers. Although Prabhupada was in Los Angeles at that time, I was on the east coast; I wasn’t personally there to hear these lectures. During those days when Prabhupada would give a lecture, devotees would immediately record it and&nbsp; then send it out very quickly to different places throughout the world. One Godbrother of mine, his name was Kesava (I have very fond memories of him also) shared some of those cassettes with me when I was visiting the temple. The only contact I had with Srila Prabhupada – except for his books - was through these cassette recordings. There was one particular lecture, the first one he gave me, which I took home and was listening to every day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt that time it was very difficult for me to understand Srila Prabhupada’s accent. His English is, of course, perfect but nonetheless he has this Bengali accent and for my ear it was very difficult to understand. I went with the cassette-player, rewound and played it again and again listening to every single thing that he said. For me it was like a daily event - listening to this lecture and slowly every day going through the lecture, one little piece at a time. There was one particular point that Prabhupada made in one particular lecture that struck me very deeply. It was a short section of the lecture but it had a deep impression on my heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact, in the Baltic festival last week, I gave a series of lectures on that short quote. Prabhupada had said that in the material world there would always be difficulties. We should not expect peace as long as we are in the material world. Being in the material world is like being in the middle of the ocean. Without any warning at any time there could be disturbance created by the waves. Therefore, a devotee should take shelter of Krsna, take shelter of service to Krsna, because in the beginning there will be a lot of tests by maya. Maya is Krsna’s agent. As Krsna’s agent, she will be testing each and every one of us to see if we are coming to Krsna to serve Him or to disturb Him. I remember when I heard that, because I was just coming to Krsna consciousness, and Prabhupada specifically stated in the beginning that there will be many tests. He warned that maya, as Krsna’s agent, will come to see if I’m sincere or if I wanted to disturb Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI really accepted those words in my heart and I felt that they were directed to me, or in other words, that Prabhupada was personally speaking to me. I felt sheltered because I was thinking, “Well, now I know that if any disturbances will come, it will be maya testing me.” I had strength from that, knowing at least what it was going to be because sometimes things happen to us and we don’t know why they are happening. But I had Prabhupada’s explanation as to why it was going to happen. So, I felt, “OK, I’m ready for maya.” As soon as there will be a test, I will immediately say, “Well, I know who you are. You are maya and Krsna sent you to test me. You want to see if I’ve come to serve Krsna or disturb Krsna, right? Well, I’m going to show you that I’m coming to serve Krsna.” I felt completely empowered on the strength of those words.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd surely, after I got that lecture from my Godbrother and listened to it very carefully (of course, I had also read Srila Prabhupada’s Bhagavad-gita and the 1st Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam), I moved into the temple. To me, that’s what Prabhupada meant by \"the beginning\" - I just assumed it had meant when I moved into the temple.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I moved into the temple, there were no tests. It was just completely blissful. It was difficult before moving into the temple because there were a lot of attachments I had to give up. I spoke about that when I was in Lithuania two or three days ago. One of the attachments was my dog. Anyway, I got over that pretty quickly. I was saying, “OK, maya, test me.” And there were no tests. I went for a few weeks thinking, “What was Prabhupada talking about? He said that in the beginning there were going to be a lot of tests, and I don't see it, don't hear it, nothing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGradually one thing started to become a little bit difficult for me and that was getting up for mangala-arati. After a few weeks I started to realize that three o’clock in the morning was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. Every day it started to become a little bit more difficult. The temple commander was a former Air Force sergeant. He lost his arm in the military in Vietnam. He only had one arm but still he was pretty strong. Just as I remembered some words of Srila Prabhupada, he also remembered some words of Srila Prabhupada. The words he remembered were, “When you come to Krsna consciousness you should surrender as if in a military fashion.” He quoted it often. In the commentary to Bhagavad-gita Prabhupada says that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, he was the person who was getting me up for mangala-arati. He started to adopt drastic measures for getting me up. I won’t tell you all the things he did, you might wonder about the early days of ISKCON but it included throwing water on me and shaking me out of the sleeping bag. One morning I specifically remember it was very-very difficult and I hit my fist against the floor and said, “That’s it. I can’t do it anymore.” For some reason I had forgotten that I was prepared for maya’s test. I was ready for it before, but now when it came I for some reason completely forgot about it. At that particular point I had that resolve, “That’s it. I can’t do it anymore.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was thinking that I was going to leave the temple but then all of a sudden, right at that moment, those words resonated in my heart. I heard them because I played them so many times on the tape recorder. I could hear Prabhupada’s voice that - in the beginning there will be so many disturbances that maya will be testing you to see if you sincerely come to serve or disturb Krsna. Right at that moment I felt like Prabhupada was massaging my heart. It was very illuminating. I made the connection finally between the test and Prabhupada’s words. It was right at that point when I realized that Prabhupada saved me. From that morning on I was able to overcome that difficulty of getting up in the morning.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, that was my first real test. It’s not that they all ended after that. As all of you know, maya is always ready to test us every step of the way. The stronger we get, the stronger she apparently gets. Her tests become more and more subtle. So it’s not just in the beginning that maya is going to test us to see if we come to serve Krsna or to disturb Krsna. They will be all the way until we actually become completely pure. This was one lecture that Prabhupada gave from the Teachings of Queen Kunti that I was listening to at that time. My Godbrother Kesava used to share with me many of those lectures that Prabhupada was giving at that time. Those lectures were like my daily nourishment in my early days of Krsna consciousness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe word is pusti, nourishment, like a person gets nourishment from eating good food. We also have to get strength and nourishment from the words of Srila Prabhupada. Those lectures, therefore, have very deep meaning for me because of the nourishment I got during those early days. Of course, I got a lot of nourishment from the temple devotees as well. My Godbrother Kesava just recently departed from this world, just a few months ago. I am very much indebted to him. It was very painful when I learned that he departed because I had not seen him since 1973. He was visiting in Boston temple from San Francisco at that time. He had a lot of association with Prabhupada because he was a very senior devotee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe was very personal. The way he treated me was unforgettable. He had a lot of association with Prabhupada. Although he looked very fixed up in Krsna consciousness to me, he never looked down on me. He never preached down to me. He was just like a friend. For me that friendship was transformational. As soon as I would come to the temple, immediately he was there, he took me to his room, we talked, and he told me stories about Prabhupada. And this is also funny. Prabhupada would often give the example, that if you are nice to the dog of a person, immediately you get the attention of a person. He once quoted ‘Love me, love my dog’ when he talked about the spiritual master as Krsna’s representative.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, whenever I came to the temple (because I couldn’t bring my dog into the temple) Kesava would often throw capatis out of the window for my dog. It captured my heart. He asked, “Where is your dog?” “I left her outside. She is out there waiting for me.” “Which side of the building is she?” “That side.” So he would go to the window with the stack of chapatis and throw them out. He was a very, very warm, friendly person.When I was visiting the temple at that time I had very long hair, I was a hippie. I used to think, “What did I do to deserve so much attention from him?” And he never wanted anything. He just wanted to talk with me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact, the reason why I joined was because of him. He told me, “You are a preacher. I can see that you are a preacher. You should travel and preach with me. Whenever you decide that you want to join, just come with me. We’ll travel and preach together.” I didn’t join right away. Just before he left the temple, he said, “I’m going to South America, to Guyana. Nobody has ever preached there before. I am going there to start preaching. When you decide you want to join, come down there and we will travel together.” When I finally did get the determination to join, I came to the temple with this in mind -that I’m coming to get my head shaved and to get my robes. I also had enough money for the ticket to go with Kesava to Guyana.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI came to the temple and said, “I want to join Prabhupada’s mission and Kesava said he wants me to preach with him.” The temple leader said, “You are not going anywhere.” “But Kesava is waiting for me.” “You are surrendering to Krsna, aren’t you?” “Yes, I surrender to Krsna.” “Then give us your money.” He took all my money and said, “You are staying here.” I never saw Kesava again. Forty years. I never saw him again. I was never able to thank him because I never travelled to South America. Although I did go to Guyana once, he was living in some other place in South America. It was very painful for me when I heard that he departed because I never was able to personally thank him. Anyway, this is the story that came to my mind at the lecture. We should always feel very grateful to those devotees who are instrumental in helping us come to Srila Prabhupada’s lotus feet. He is one devotee to whom I am extremely grateful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI’m going to read from Teachings of Queen Kunti and we’ll speak a little bit from these lectures.<br />\r\n\tChapter Twelve “Bewildering Pastimes”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tna veda kascid bhagavams cikirsitam<br />\r\n\ttavehamanasya nrnam vidambanam<br />\r\n\tna yasya kascid dayito 'sti karhicid<br />\r\n\tdvesyas ca yasmin visama matir nrnam\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“O Lord, no one can understand Your transcendental pastimes, which appear to be human and are so misleading. You have no specific object of favor, nor do You have any object of envy. People only imagine that You are partial.” (SB 1.8.29)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Lord’s mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of hostility. The very conception of the Personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. His pastimes appear to be exactly like a human being’s, but actually they are transcendental and without any tinge of material contamination. He is undoubtedly known as partial to His pure devotees, but in fact He is never partial, as much as the sun is never partial to anyone. By utilizing the sunrays, sometimes even the stones become valuable, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun, although there are enough sunrays before him. Darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in distributing its rays. The sunrays are open to everyone, but the capacities of the receptacles differ. Foolish people think that devotional service is flattering the Lord to get special mercy. Factually the pure devotees who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are not a mercantile community. A mercantile house renders service to someone in exchange for values. The pure devotee does not render service unto the Lord for such exchange, and therefore the full mercy of the Lord is open for him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we said, these prayers are very beautiful. Queen Kunti-devi is revealing the depth of her heart in her prayers to Krsna. She is perfectly displaying her completely unmotivated service to Him. This is a very common thing that Srila Prabhupada speaks about in his commentaries and in his lectures. Of course, Srila Prabhupada always speaks about unmotivated devotional service because it is the duty of the acharya, when speaking, to preach the glories of devotional service in the beginning, middle and end— everywhere in Srimad Bhagavatam to enunciate these glories.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes when we read Srila Prabhupada’s commentaries we might wonder how it is that Srila Prabhupada always seems to present everything in terms of pure devotional service. Obviously it’s because he understood that the purpose of all the scriptures is to bring us to the platform of pure devotional service. He knew the purpose behind Narada Muni’s instructions to Vyasadeva. When Vyasadeva was feeling dissatisfaction because he had neglected to adequately glorify the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Narada instructed him to present the Srimad Bhagavatam. Therefore, we see consistently everywhere in Srila Prabhupada's commentaries that the glories of pure devotional service are always expanded. He speaks a lot in these lectures about unmotivated, devotional service to Krsna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes we may think that it is difficult to always hear about unmotivated devotional service. We think, “That’s way up there and I am down here. If I always hear about unmotivated service, I’ll get discouraged because I am not unmotivated.” Or we may think, “Krsna’s asking too much for unmotivated devotional service.” Or we may think, “Hearing about unmotivated devotional service somehow doesn’t resonate in my heart because my heart is filled with so many desires, therefore when I hear about the unmotivated devotional service it doesn’t do anything to me.” Actually, these phenomena are explained in the Bhagavatam. In the 1st Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah<br />\r\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah<br />\r\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani<br />\r\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam (SB 1.2.17)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Krsna who is the Supersoul in the heart of all living beings cleanses the desire for material enjoyment in the heart of those persons who develops the urge to hear His messages which are themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Bhagavatam states that Krsna cleans the hearts of those who develop the urge to hear the Bhagavatam. Therefore, when one hears the glories of pure devotional service, it’s supposed to act in this way— cleaning the heart —but sometimes the cleaning is painful. In the process of cleaning sometimes we see that the dirt in our hearts starts to come to the surface.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada gives the example of ghee. When you put butter on a low flame, it starts boiling gradually - you see the things that you didn’t see before. You never knew that all of these impurities were there when you first melted the butter. But if you keep it on the flame, you’ll see ph-ph-ph start coming to the surface and you start recognizing, “Wow! I didn’t know it was there.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnybody who makes pure ghee knows that you have to use a ladle with holes in it to take the impurities off the top and separate them from the pure ghee. Prabhupada says that purification is like this. Cleansing the heart means that all of the impurities start to come to the surface. Therefore, in His instructions to Srila Rupa Goswami, Lord Caitanya explains that upon receiving the Holy Name of the Lord from the spiritual master, or in other words, when the seed of devotion is planted in the heart, one has to continue the watering process. The watering process waters both the devotional creeper as well as the weeds that are there within the heart. Lord Caitanya says that one has to discriminate between the devotional plant and the weeds that can choke the devotional plant. If one doesn’t discriminate properly and can’t see “this is the seed of the devotional plant and these are the weeds,” one will mistakenly continue to water the weeds. Although the weeds were barely visible before, all of a sudden they begin to grow faster and can choke that plant. If you have ever cultivated a garden, you must have had that experience - that weeds tend to grow everywhere and if you don’t pull out the weeds, there won’t be sufficient nourishment for the plant. They’ll take all the nourishment for themselves and the plants will become unhealthy, they will wither and eventually die.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakura describes it in a different way, “When sraddha takes birth in the heart, it’s like the appearance of a new-born baby-girl.” What is sraddha? Sraddha is the seed of bhakti. It’s faith in pure devotional service. That’s what initially attracts us, that faith in pure devotional service. Those who preach the glories of pure devotional service can awaken that faith of pure devotional service in the hearts of those who previously had no faith. I remember one lecture Prabhupada gave on the verse,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya<br />\r\n\tvasudeva-katha-rucih<br />\r\n\tsyan mahat-sevaya viprah<br />\r\n\tpunya-tirtha-nisevanat (SB 1.2.16)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy serving devotees who are completely free from vice great service is done. By such service one develops the affinity for hearing the glories of pure devotional service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this lecture Srila Prabhupada said something very profound. He said, “I have created your faith.” In other words, as Bhaktivinoda Thakura said that sraddha is like a birth of a new-born baby girl, Srila Prabhupada says, “I have impregnated you and now a baby girl (faith) is taking birth.” Because Prabhupada is potent, therefore, he can impregnate or awaken that faith.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur whole method of preaching Krsna consciousness is based on awakening faith. Lord Nityananda, the original spiritual master, by His method of distributing Krsna consciousness awakened faith in the hearts of those who previously had no faith. He awakened faith in Jagai and Madhai, he awakened faith in Lord Caitanya to Jagai and Madhai because His method itself was to awaken that faith, because the method was so purely motivated, no tinge of karma and jnana, no personal interest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLord Nityananda and Haridasa Thakura are like two patrolmen who go out on Ajna Tahal. They wander about the streets begging everybody, “Please chant Krsna’s names, serve Krsna, make Krsna’s teachings your life.” Wherever they go, this was their message. Lord Caitanya sent them out on sankirtana every day. When He sent them out He said, “Every day you come back from sankirtana and give me your results.” Lord Caitanya was an original sankirtana leader sending Nityananda and Haridasa out on sankirtana every day and said, “Tell me who chanted Krsna’s name today.” Haridasa Thakura and Nityananda would go out with His order on their heads begging others to please chant Krsna’s name.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey had no other motive except to serve the order of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Therefore their method of distribution was so pure that it awakened faith. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says in the Vaisnava-siddhanta-mala that this type of patrolling has to be performed. One shouldn’t go out asking for milk and rice. This will not awaken faith. Nityananda awakened faith because the only result He wanted to offer to Lord Caitanya were those who were chanting Krsna’s names.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe would cry, sometimes He would fall on the ground with tears on His eyes, “Please chant Krsna’s name.” Just seeing that awakened faith. Such is the power of pure Vaisnavas. Not only do they speak but their words impregnated them in such a way that it awakened faith.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada said in that lecture, “I have created your faith.” Of course, the potential is already there within the heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnitya-siddha krsna-prema ‘sadhya' kabhu naya<br />\r\n\tsravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya (CC Madhya 22.107)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPure love for Krsna is eternally situated within the heart of every living being. It doesn’t come from any other source. sravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya. When one hears about Krsna from the right source, it’s brought out. Prabhupada says, “The catalyst has to be there to bring it out. Just like fire is in the wood, it’s lying dormant, but unless you touch it with the catalyst, you can’t bring it out. Pure love is situated in the heart but it needs a catalyst to bring it out.” Prabhupada said in this lecture, “I have given you this faith.” His words were potent with prema-bhakti. His words were potent with love for Krsna. Coming in contact with his words and seeing his example was such a totally consistent experience that you couldn’t help but have faith.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, one had to have adhikara as well. But even if one didn’t have adhikara, Prabhupada still had that potency to awaken faith in those who didn’t even know … (a short pause in the recording). Therefore he spoke only about devotional service. Of course, you sometimes hear in his conversations that Prabhupada would talk about many other topics, but he always brought it to the siddhanta and he was always prepared to speak uncompromisingly to anyone about siddhanta. Prabhupada wouldn’t mince words. He would speak boldly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBhaktivinoda Thakura gives this example that shraddha, faith, when it’s awakened within the heart, is like the birth of a new-born baby-girl. When a girl takes her birth, the mother has to be very careful to protect her. She protects her from heat and cold, hunger and thirst and from dangerous creatures. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, “Just as mother protects a new-born girl, she also gives nourishment, pusti. Simultaneously along with protecting, the mother continues to nourish the child to give strength to fight off these bad elements themselves. In this same way, sraddha, faith in pure devotional service, is established within the heart.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Prabhupada says in Caitanya Caritamrita, “There are many seeds that can be planted within the heart.” For instance, there’s the karma-bija, the jnana-bija and so many other bijas. But in Sri Caitanya’s instructions to Srila Rupa Goswami He speaks about bhakti-lata-bija. Bhakti-lata-bija is the seed of pure devotional service. When that seed of pure devotional service is planted and awakened, then nourishment has to continue. What does nourishment mean? It means that one has to continue hearing about pure devotional service. And then just as a mother protects her child from heat and cold, hunger and thirst, the guardians of devotional service are supposed to protect our hearts from the influence of karma and jnana.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore Prabhupada often quoted the verse,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tbhukti-mukti-sprha yavat pisaci hrdi vartate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBhukti is the desire for material enjoyment, and mukti is the desire for liberation. They are like two witches that haunt one like a ghost. As long as these two witches are there in the heart haunting one, one will never taste the bliss of bhakti. Bhakti will always remain a mystery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe may hear so much about pure bhakti, about the bliss of devotional service. Rupa Goswami makes the comparison that one drop of bhakti can inundate the whole universe. It makes the pleasure derived from jnana to be so insignificant. Srila Prabhupada would quote the verse by Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate<br />\r\n\t(Sri Caitanya-candramrta 5, Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati Thakura)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne who has, just once, caught a merciful glance of Lord Caitanya then kaivalyam narakayate, liberation for him becomes like hell. tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate, the pleasure of the heavenly planets becomes like a phantasmagoria and the venomous serpents of the senses become like serpents with broken fangs. They no longer have any poisonous effect. Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati gives this example also. He says, “Senses are like venomous serpents. A venomous serpent always looks for an object to strike. Senses are also looking for an object to strike. But if anyone gets a merciful glance of Lord Caitanya, then the venomous serpents of the senses become like serpents with broken fangs.” They no longer have a poisonous effect. And then he says, “visvam purna-sukhayate – the whole universe becomes joyful by that merciful glance. And the positions of Brahma and Indra – they become like insignificant insects.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat’s one merciful glance of Lord Caitanya. That merciful glance of Lord Caitanya is compared to the awakening of faith in pure bhakti. But that bliss of pure devotional service will always remain a mystery as long as the desires for bhukti and mukti are within the heart. Therefore, one has to be very careful, as Lord Caitanya instructed, to discriminate between the weeds and the devotional creeper. “What is the weed that will choke my devotional plant? How do we get rid of those weeds?” That is the science of devotional service, how to get rid of those weeds. So many instructions are given in the Bhagavatam.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we were having the Bhagavatam class at the Baltic festival last week, we were reading the verses told by Kapiladeva to Devahuti. Lord Kapiladeva told Devahuti,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi<br />\r\n\tsarva-sanga-vivarjitah<br />\r\n\tsangas tesv atha te prarthyah<br />\r\n\tsanga-dosa-hara hi te (SB 3.25.24)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“My mother, o virtuous lady, you have to seek the attachment of those who are always talking about Krsna, who are always talking about pure devotional service. Seek out for their association and become attached to hearing from them. It will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachment.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the science of devotional service. This is the method of cleaning the heart. We can’t eradicate these attachments ourselves. We don’t have the strength to fight maya. Just like, when I had my first test from maya and said, “I can’t do it.” I was foolishly thinking that I was the doer and therefore said, “I can’t do it”. But it did not depend upon me. I can never do it alone. I am always dependent on the mercy of Vaisnavas. ”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat’s what Lord Kapiladeva is saying also. Lord Kapiladeva says, “You can’t do it. But if you depend on the mercy of Vaisnavas, you can do it because they give you the extra strength to overcome your attachments. All you have to do is to become attached to hearing from them because they are speaking about pure devotional service.” Become attached to hearing about pure devotional service even though, “I know I know. It’s so far away. I can’t do it. It’s too much.” But an honest and sincere person will realize, “These are things I don’t want. I don’t want these attachments. They are dragging me down. I can’t get rid of them myself.” The Bhagavatam says, “Ok. Don’t get rid of your attachments. Feed them.” How do you feed your attachments? Become attached to Vaisnavas. Lord Kapiladeva says, “Every learned person knows that attachment to the material things is the cause of bondage for the living entity but when the same attachment is applied to a self-realized devotee, moksa-dvaram apavrtam, the gates to liberation are open. Don’t give up attachment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe’ve been reading Queen Kunti’s prayers. Queen Kunti says to Krsna, “You are the property of the materially-impoverished.” Prabhupada says, “The living entity is finished as soon as he has nothing to possess. Everyone has to possess something. He is finished if he has nothing to possess.” It’s the symptom of life to possess something. The first words Prabhupada says right there in the commentary, “The living entity is finished as soon as he has nothing to possess.” Everybody who hears this says, “Wow! Prabhupada knows my heart. He knows that I have to possess something.” Of course, Prabhupada goes on to explain what the most valuable possession is. The most valuable possession is when one possesses Krsna within the core of his heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, Prabhupada says, “Don’t give up your attachments. Change your attachments. Become attached to hearing from Vaisnavas.” Lord Kapiladeva says the same thing in the Bhagavatam, “If you become attached to Vaisnavas, this will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachment.” It’s not that, “I’ll give it up by myself.” We can’t give it up ourselves. That’s what the impersonalists try to do. Due to intense frustration, impersonalists say “I give it up.” They try to renounce everything. But Lord Brahma says that you can’t become fully liberated by such a method of giving up. He says “You’ll fall down from that position of imagined superiority because you never become attached to Krsna’s lotus feet.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo the symptom of life is to be attached. The Vaisnavas are so kind that they are giving us what we should be attached to even before we realize it, even before we have the desire to want it. They are giving it even before we’ve asked for it. Prabhupada says, “That’s the method of distribution.” Lord Caitanya says, “Take!” Previously when Krsna came, He said, “Abandon all varieties of religions and surrender unto Me.” When Krsna came, He said, “First surrender and then I’ll deliver you from sinful reactions.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut when Lord Caitanya came, He said, “Take!” All conditions removed. “Take this Holy Name of the Lord. Take this pure devotional service. Take it, make it your life. Take the Holy name but chant it sincerely. Serve the holy name. The Holy name will eradicate, will cleanse all the desires within your heart.” Without any previous qualification someone came and said, “Take!” Just like my Godbrother Kesava who gave me that tape, “Take.” I took it. No questions asked. I didn’t say, “I don’t deserve it.” I was greedy. I took it. I listened to it every day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is Lord Caitanya’s method of helping us to overcome our attachments. If we don’t take, we won’t advance. There’s plenty to take but we have to take it. The Bhagavatam says,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah<br />\r\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah<br />\r\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani<br />\r\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam (SB 1.2.17)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul in the heart of all living entities, cleanses the desire for material enjoyment from the heart of that person who developed the urge to take.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat’s what Bhagavatam says. Just develop the urge to take. Don’t ask, \"Why should I take it?\" Don’t fight. Just take it. What happens then? The more we take, the more we begin to see that pure devotional service and we see the other things that start to come to the surface of our hearts. The Bhagavatam says, “That’s OK. Just keep on taking.” But we think, “I don’t know. These things that are coming up in my heart they are consuming me. How can I think about taking? I might lose. If I keep on taking and taking, Krsna in my heart might take too. He might take something away that I didn’t give Him. I’m going to protect this. Because if I keep hearing about pure devotional service, when I might not be looking, Krsna might take something away. So, I have to keep watching. Krsna, I’m holding on to it so You won’t take it. But if I keep on hearing how You are going to take my attachments away from me, that’s too disturbing. Maybe I should hear from people who are going to tell me I can keep them. Let me hear from those who talk about karma and jnana. I’m not ready for pure bhakti yet. Let me hear about these other things that let me feel more comfortable about my attachments.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf one is not careful, he abandons hearing about pure devotional service or he could lose his taste.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tbhogaisvarya-prasaktanam<br />\r\n\ttayapahrta-cetasam<br />\r\n\tvyavasayatmika buddhih<br />\r\n\tsamadhau na vidhiyate (Bg 2.44)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“In the minds of those who are too much attached to material opulence and sense enjoyment and who are bewildered by such things, there’s no resolute determination to take to pure bhakti.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna is warning us that if we refuse to keep on taking the medicine of pure devotional service, the urge to go on hearing these messages will gradually wane within the heart. One can lose taste or one can begin to think that there are many other tastes that are nicer right now. “I’ll come back to this other taste some other time.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Narada Muni was already way ahead of you. When he told Vyasadeva to compile the Bhagavatam he already knew that some people would think like this. Therefore, in order to convince Vyasa to compile the Bhagavatam, he told him, “Those who forsake their material occupational duties in order to take pure devotional service may fall down at an immature stage, but there’s no danger of being unsuccessful. On the other hand, even though a non-devotee is perfectly engaged in his occupational duties, he doesn’t gain anything.” He says, “My dear Vyasa, even though a devotee of Lord Krsna sometimes falls down somehow or other he cannot become a fruitive worker again because anyone who once has had the taste of Krsna’s lotus feet will never be able to forget that ecstasy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe may try. We may try very hard. We may do so many things to try to forget, but it won’t last permanently. Sooner or later it will bring us back to Krsna’s lotus feet. But of course, a foolish person should never try to lose the shelter of Krsna’s lotus feet. If one tries to forget the shelter of Krsna’s lotus feet and wanders about into all other activities, it will only lead to suffering. That’s all. An intelligent person should avoid these things.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, Prabhupada would oftentimes quote the verse from Caitanya Caritamrita, “My devotee engages in devotional service but at the same time he wants to taste something else too. Why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him take shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget these things.” Therefore, Krsna fulfills the desires of His devotees in such a way that a devotee will come back and never ask for it again. This is not very intelligent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada says in the Sixth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam that an intelligent person learns from hearing. The less intelligent person hears, but thinks, “I’ll still do it.” He could have avoided the suffering but he thinks, “I’ll still do it.” The least intelligent person has heard, he is punished, he suffers but he will still do it again. Therefore, one should become intelligent. An intelligent person will simply go on hearing even though his heart is filled with desires and attachments. “Just go on hearing the glories of pure devotional service. It will give you the strength to overcome all of the attachment that are there within your heart. Don’t lose hope and don’t give it up.” It will act.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada says just like fire burns. A child may not know that the fire burns but when the child touches the fire, it burns. The fire doesn’t think, “This is a child. I won’t burn him.” No, it will act. In the same way, hearing the glories of pure devotional service will act.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI want to add just by reading one verse. It’s the verse from the Bhagavatam I quoted the other day where Srila Prabhupada speaks about this point in Srila Prabhupada’s own unique way. Prabhupada has a way with words. It’s his trademark.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt’s the verse from the Fifth Canto of the Bhagavatam. The verse speaks about pure devotees and what happens in an assembly of pure devotees. It’s the verse from the Fifth Canto, Chapter 12, Text 13. Who are the pure devotees mentioned here?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tyatrottamasloka-gunanuvadah<br />\r\n\tprastuyate gramya-katha-vighatah<br />\r\n\tnisevyamano 'nudinam mumuksor<br />\r\n\tmatim satim yacchati vasudeve\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Who are the pure devotees mentioned here? In an assembly of pure devotees, there is no question of discussing material subjects like politics and sociology. In an assembly of pure devotees, there is discussion only of the qualities, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is praised and worshiped with full attention. In the association of pure devotees, by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vāsudeva.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe symptoms of pure devotees are described in this verse. The pure devotee is never interested in material topics. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has strictly prohibited His devotees to talk about worldly matters. Gramya-varta na kahibe: one should not indulge in talking unnecessarily about news of the material world. One should not waste time in this way. This is a very important feature in the life of a devotee. A devotee has no other ambition than to serve Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was started to engage people twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord and in His glorification. The students in this institution engage in the cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness from five in the morning to ten at night. They actually have no opportunity to waste their time unnecessarily by discussing politics, sociology and current events. This will go their own way. A devotee is concerned only with serving Kṛṣṇa positively and seriously.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPURPORT by Niranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrabhupada says in many places (I can show you so many places) in the Bhagavatam that our Krsna consciousness movement is established for this purpose. It was established for Hari-katha. Devotees understand the importance of regularly hearing Hari-katha, the glories of pure devotional service. When they actually make it their daily nourishment, they will see that this is the method of dealing with all of those attachments. “Just go on hearing. Don’t give it up. Don’t think there are some other topics that are more important.” These are the most important topics for those who are aspiring for Krsna’s lotus feet. Of course, if we are not aspiring for Krsna’s lotus feet, we’ll find many other topics to hear about. But those who are aspiring for Krsna’s lotus feet will see that these topics will gradually bring us to Krsna’s lotus feet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, Lord Brahma says anyone who has faith in hearing these topics or, as Lord Krsna says to Uddhava, “Having awakened faith in hearing narrations of Krsna, being disgusted with material life, knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering but still not able to give it up this is My devotee should simply remain happy and continue serving Me with faith. Because My devotee knows that all sense gratification leads to suffering because he has awakened faith in hearing these narrations - he will sincerely repent in his heart for his inability to give it up.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat’s the symptom of a devotee – he sincerely repents within his heart for his inability to give it up. He prays to Krsna, “Please help me to eradicate these attachments.” He doesn’t justify them in his heart. “Oh, no, actually these things are more important.” He knows, “I have to give these things up. I can’t do it alone. I’m completely dependent on Krsna’s mercy and completely dependent on the mercy of Vaisnavas to clean my heart who are very mercifully giving me the Holy name and who are watering the Holy name by discussing the glories of the Holy name.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn Caitanya Caritamrita it is stated that one should learn the truth and the beauty of the Holy name by hearing the revealed scriptures from the mouths of Vaisnavas. There’s no other way to taste the sweetness of Krsna’s Holy name. Prabhupada is doing this for us in his beautiful, beautiful commentaries to Srimad Bhagavatam. His lectures are like nectar. Have all of you read this book? Is there anyone who hasn’t read this book? Nectar! Take it. Hare Krsna. Thank you very much.\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"safe_value": "<p>\n\tThe following is a partially edited transcription of a lecture delivered on August 1, 2013 in St. Petersburg, Russia from the \"Teachings of Queen Kunti\" on the chapter entitled \"Bewildering Pastimes\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI am happy to be here with all of you today. I haven’t been here in St. Petersburg for eight years. I used to make an annual pilgrimage here which began twenty-five years ago. I've been away too long. I am relieved. I'm very fond of coming here. As soon as I got out of the airport and began driving through the streets, I began reflecting on those memories. Not all of them were good, some were difficult, some were funny - like my confrontation with a KGB agent. It was here in Leningrad in 1989. He grabbed my scarf, started tightening it around my neck and said, “Are you an anarchist?” I replied “I do tend to be a little independent at times.Why do you ask?” He made some kind of remark like, “People who wear purple scarves in the Soviet Union are anarchists.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt that time I didn’t know that this wasn’t true, but he was tightening the scarf around my neck. He then stopped, threw it in my face and said, “We’ll be watching you.” But that was the last day of my tour. I was flying from Leningrad to Warsaw. He didn’t bother me anymore after that. I wasn’t here. But it was one of my memories here. Most of them were very memorable. Different places I preached in, different halls and different flats I preached in and especially the devotees I met - I have fond memories of all of them. I hope to see some of them here as I do – Gargacharya Prabhu, Sri Nathaji Prabhu, who were here back in those days. Who else?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you for receiving me. I’m going to do a bit of speaking from the Teachings of Queen Kunti. For several weeks I’ve been speaking from this book. From time to time I like to read and speak from it. In some of the places I’ve been travelling to, I shared my reasons for my attraction to the lectures from this book. I’ll share some of them with you today. I do it only because I feel that I want to increase you appreciation for these lectures that Srila Prabhupada gave in the early 1970's in Los Angeles. Of course, all of his lectures are brilliant and deeply devotional but these particular lectures had a very deep impression on me because Prabhupada was giving them at the same time I started coming to the Krsna consciousness movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada was speaking from the prayers of Queen Kunti from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1. Every day he would speak from a verse from these prayers. Although Prabhupada was in Los Angeles at that time, I was on the east coast; I wasn’t personally there to hear these lectures. During those days when Prabhupada would give a lecture, devotees would immediately record it and  then send it out very quickly to different places throughout the world. One Godbrother of mine, his name was Kesava (I have very fond memories of him also) shared some of those cassettes with me when I was visiting the temple. The only contact I had with Srila Prabhupada – except for his books - was through these cassette recordings. There was one particular lecture, the first one he gave me, which I took home and was listening to every day.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt that time it was very difficult for me to understand Srila Prabhupada’s accent. His English is, of course, perfect but nonetheless he has this Bengali accent and for my ear it was very difficult to understand. I went with the cassette-player, rewound and played it again and again listening to every single thing that he said. For me it was like a daily event - listening to this lecture and slowly every day going through the lecture, one little piece at a time. There was one particular point that Prabhupada made in one particular lecture that struck me very deeply. It was a short section of the lecture but it had a deep impression on my heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, in the Baltic festival last week, I gave a series of lectures on that short quote. Prabhupada had said that in the material world there would always be difficulties. We should not expect peace as long as we are in the material world. Being in the material world is like being in the middle of the ocean. Without any warning at any time there could be disturbance created by the waves. Therefore, a devotee should take shelter of Krsna, take shelter of service to Krsna, because in the beginning there will be a lot of tests by maya. Maya is Krsna’s agent. As Krsna’s agent, she will be testing each and every one of us to see if we are coming to Krsna to serve Him or to disturb Him. I remember when I heard that, because I was just coming to Krsna consciousness, and Prabhupada specifically stated in the beginning that there will be many tests. He warned that maya, as Krsna’s agent, will come to see if I’m sincere or if I wanted to disturb Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI really accepted those words in my heart and I felt that they were directed to me, or in other words, that Prabhupada was personally speaking to me. I felt sheltered because I was thinking, “Well, now I know that if any disturbances will come, it will be maya testing me.” I had strength from that, knowing at least what it was going to be because sometimes things happen to us and we don’t know why they are happening. But I had Prabhupada’s explanation as to why it was going to happen. So, I felt, “OK, I’m ready for maya.” As soon as there will be a test, I will immediately say, “Well, I know who you are. You are maya and Krsna sent you to test me. You want to see if I’ve come to serve Krsna or disturb Krsna, right? Well, I’m going to show you that I’m coming to serve Krsna.” I felt completely empowered on the strength of those words.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd surely, after I got that lecture from my Godbrother and listened to it very carefully (of course, I had also read Srila Prabhupada’s Bhagavad-gita and the 1st Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam), I moved into the temple. To me, that’s what Prabhupada meant by \"the beginning\" - I just assumed it had meant when I moved into the temple.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I moved into the temple, there were no tests. It was just completely blissful. It was difficult before moving into the temple because there were a lot of attachments I had to give up. I spoke about that when I was in Lithuania two or three days ago. One of the attachments was my dog. Anyway, I got over that pretty quickly. I was saying, “OK, maya, test me.” And there were no tests. I went for a few weeks thinking, “What was Prabhupada talking about? He said that in the beginning there were going to be a lot of tests, and I don't see it, don't hear it, nothing.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGradually one thing started to become a little bit difficult for me and that was getting up for mangala-arati. After a few weeks I started to realize that three o’clock in the morning was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. Every day it started to become a little bit more difficult. The temple commander was a former Air Force sergeant. He lost his arm in the military in Vietnam. He only had one arm but still he was pretty strong. Just as I remembered some words of Srila Prabhupada, he also remembered some words of Srila Prabhupada. The words he remembered were, “When you come to Krsna consciousness you should surrender as if in a military fashion.” He quoted it often. In the commentary to Bhagavad-gita Prabhupada says that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, he was the person who was getting me up for mangala-arati. He started to adopt drastic measures for getting me up. I won’t tell you all the things he did, you might wonder about the early days of ISKCON but it included throwing water on me and shaking me out of the sleeping bag. One morning I specifically remember it was very-very difficult and I hit my fist against the floor and said, “That’s it. I can’t do it anymore.” For some reason I had forgotten that I was prepared for maya’s test. I was ready for it before, but now when it came I for some reason completely forgot about it. At that particular point I had that resolve, “That’s it. I can’t do it anymore.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was thinking that I was going to leave the temple but then all of a sudden, right at that moment, those words resonated in my heart. I heard them because I played them so many times on the tape recorder. I could hear Prabhupada’s voice that - in the beginning there will be so many disturbances that maya will be testing you to see if you sincerely come to serve or disturb Krsna. Right at that moment I felt like Prabhupada was massaging my heart. It was very illuminating. I made the connection finally between the test and Prabhupada’s words. It was right at that point when I realized that Prabhupada saved me. From that morning on I was able to overcome that difficulty of getting up in the morning.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, that was my first real test. It’s not that they all ended after that. As all of you know, maya is always ready to test us every step of the way. The stronger we get, the stronger she apparently gets. Her tests become more and more subtle. So it’s not just in the beginning that maya is going to test us to see if we come to serve Krsna or to disturb Krsna. They will be all the way until we actually become completely pure. This was one lecture that Prabhupada gave from the Teachings of Queen Kunti that I was listening to at that time. My Godbrother Kesava used to share with me many of those lectures that Prabhupada was giving at that time. Those lectures were like my daily nourishment in my early days of Krsna consciousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe word is pusti, nourishment, like a person gets nourishment from eating good food. We also have to get strength and nourishment from the words of Srila Prabhupada. Those lectures, therefore, have very deep meaning for me because of the nourishment I got during those early days. Of course, I got a lot of nourishment from the temple devotees as well. My Godbrother Kesava just recently departed from this world, just a few months ago. I am very much indebted to him. It was very painful when I learned that he departed because I had not seen him since 1973. He was visiting in Boston temple from San Francisco at that time. He had a lot of association with Prabhupada because he was a very senior devotee.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe was very personal. The way he treated me was unforgettable. He had a lot of association with Prabhupada. Although he looked very fixed up in Krsna consciousness to me, he never looked down on me. He never preached down to me. He was just like a friend. For me that friendship was transformational. As soon as I would come to the temple, immediately he was there, he took me to his room, we talked, and he told me stories about Prabhupada. And this is also funny. Prabhupada would often give the example, that if you are nice to the dog of a person, immediately you get the attention of a person. He once quoted ‘Love me, love my dog’ when he talked about the spiritual master as Krsna’s representative.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, whenever I came to the temple (because I couldn’t bring my dog into the temple) Kesava would often throw capatis out of the window for my dog. It captured my heart. He asked, “Where is your dog?” “I left her outside. She is out there waiting for me.” “Which side of the building is she?” “That side.” So he would go to the window with the stack of chapatis and throw them out. He was a very, very warm, friendly person.When I was visiting the temple at that time I had very long hair, I was a hippie. I used to think, “What did I do to deserve so much attention from him?” And he never wanted anything. He just wanted to talk with me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, the reason why I joined was because of him. He told me, “You are a preacher. I can see that you are a preacher. You should travel and preach with me. Whenever you decide that you want to join, just come with me. We’ll travel and preach together.” I didn’t join right away. Just before he left the temple, he said, “I’m going to South America, to Guyana. Nobody has ever preached there before. I am going there to start preaching. When you decide you want to join, come down there and we will travel together.” When I finally did get the determination to join, I came to the temple with this in mind -that I’m coming to get my head shaved and to get my robes. I also had enough money for the ticket to go with Kesava to Guyana.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI came to the temple and said, “I want to join Prabhupada’s mission and Kesava said he wants me to preach with him.” The temple leader said, “You are not going anywhere.” “But Kesava is waiting for me.” “You are surrendering to Krsna, aren’t you?” “Yes, I surrender to Krsna.” “Then give us your money.” He took all my money and said, “You are staying here.” I never saw Kesava again. Forty years. I never saw him again. I was never able to thank him because I never travelled to South America. Although I did go to Guyana once, he was living in some other place in South America. It was very painful for me when I heard that he departed because I never was able to personally thank him. Anyway, this is the story that came to my mind at the lecture. We should always feel very grateful to those devotees who are instrumental in helping us come to Srila Prabhupada’s lotus feet. He is one devotee to whom I am extremely grateful.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI’m going to read from Teachings of Queen Kunti and we’ll speak a little bit from these lectures.<br />\n\tChapter Twelve “Bewildering Pastimes”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tna veda kascid bhagavams cikirsitam<br />\n\ttavehamanasya nrnam vidambanam<br />\n\tna yasya kascid dayito 'sti karhicid<br />\n\tdvesyas ca yasmin visama matir nrnam\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“O Lord, no one can understand Your transcendental pastimes, which appear to be human and are so misleading. You have no specific object of favor, nor do You have any object of envy. People only imagine that You are partial.” (SB 1.8.29)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord’s mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of hostility. The very conception of the Personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. His pastimes appear to be exactly like a human being’s, but actually they are transcendental and without any tinge of material contamination. He is undoubtedly known as partial to His pure devotees, but in fact He is never partial, as much as the sun is never partial to anyone. By utilizing the sunrays, sometimes even the stones become valuable, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun, although there are enough sunrays before him. Darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in distributing its rays. The sunrays are open to everyone, but the capacities of the receptacles differ. Foolish people think that devotional service is flattering the Lord to get special mercy. Factually the pure devotees who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are not a mercantile community. A mercantile house renders service to someone in exchange for values. The pure devotee does not render service unto the Lord for such exchange, and therefore the full mercy of the Lord is open for him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we said, these prayers are very beautiful. Queen Kunti-devi is revealing the depth of her heart in her prayers to Krsna. She is perfectly displaying her completely unmotivated service to Him. This is a very common thing that Srila Prabhupada speaks about in his commentaries and in his lectures. Of course, Srila Prabhupada always speaks about unmotivated devotional service because it is the duty of the acharya, when speaking, to preach the glories of devotional service in the beginning, middle and end— everywhere in Srimad Bhagavatam to enunciate these glories.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes when we read Srila Prabhupada’s commentaries we might wonder how it is that Srila Prabhupada always seems to present everything in terms of pure devotional service. Obviously it’s because he understood that the purpose of all the scriptures is to bring us to the platform of pure devotional service. He knew the purpose behind Narada Muni’s instructions to Vyasadeva. When Vyasadeva was feeling dissatisfaction because he had neglected to adequately glorify the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Narada instructed him to present the Srimad Bhagavatam. Therefore, we see consistently everywhere in Srila Prabhupada's commentaries that the glories of pure devotional service are always expanded. He speaks a lot in these lectures about unmotivated, devotional service to Krsna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes we may think that it is difficult to always hear about unmotivated devotional service. We think, “That’s way up there and I am down here. If I always hear about unmotivated service, I’ll get discouraged because I am not unmotivated.” Or we may think, “Krsna’s asking too much for unmotivated devotional service.” Or we may think, “Hearing about unmotivated devotional service somehow doesn’t resonate in my heart because my heart is filled with so many desires, therefore when I hear about the unmotivated devotional service it doesn’t do anything to me.” Actually, these phenomena are explained in the Bhagavatam. In the 1st Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah<br />\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah<br />\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani<br />\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam (SB 1.2.17)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Krsna who is the Supersoul in the heart of all living beings cleanses the desire for material enjoyment in the heart of those persons who develops the urge to hear His messages which are themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bhagavatam states that Krsna cleans the hearts of those who develop the urge to hear the Bhagavatam. Therefore, when one hears the glories of pure devotional service, it’s supposed to act in this way— cleaning the heart —but sometimes the cleaning is painful. In the process of cleaning sometimes we see that the dirt in our hearts starts to come to the surface.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada gives the example of ghee. When you put butter on a low flame, it starts boiling gradually - you see the things that you didn’t see before. You never knew that all of these impurities were there when you first melted the butter. But if you keep it on the flame, you’ll see ph-ph-ph start coming to the surface and you start recognizing, “Wow! I didn’t know it was there.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnybody who makes pure ghee knows that you have to use a ladle with holes in it to take the impurities off the top and separate them from the pure ghee. Prabhupada says that purification is like this. Cleansing the heart means that all of the impurities start to come to the surface. Therefore, in His instructions to Srila Rupa Goswami, Lord Caitanya explains that upon receiving the Holy Name of the Lord from the spiritual master, or in other words, when the seed of devotion is planted in the heart, one has to continue the watering process. The watering process waters both the devotional creeper as well as the weeds that are there within the heart. Lord Caitanya says that one has to discriminate between the devotional plant and the weeds that can choke the devotional plant. If one doesn’t discriminate properly and can’t see “this is the seed of the devotional plant and these are the weeds,” one will mistakenly continue to water the weeds. Although the weeds were barely visible before, all of a sudden they begin to grow faster and can choke that plant. If you have ever cultivated a garden, you must have had that experience - that weeds tend to grow everywhere and if you don’t pull out the weeds, there won’t be sufficient nourishment for the plant. They’ll take all the nourishment for themselves and the plants will become unhealthy, they will wither and eventually die.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakura describes it in a different way, “When sraddha takes birth in the heart, it’s like the appearance of a new-born baby-girl.” What is sraddha? Sraddha is the seed of bhakti. It’s faith in pure devotional service. That’s what initially attracts us, that faith in pure devotional service. Those who preach the glories of pure devotional service can awaken that faith of pure devotional service in the hearts of those who previously had no faith. I remember one lecture Prabhupada gave on the verse,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya<br />\n\tvasudeva-katha-rucih<br />\n\tsyan mahat-sevaya viprah<br />\n\tpunya-tirtha-nisevanat (SB 1.2.16)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBy serving devotees who are completely free from vice great service is done. By such service one develops the affinity for hearing the glories of pure devotional service.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this lecture Srila Prabhupada said something very profound. He said, “I have created your faith.” In other words, as Bhaktivinoda Thakura said that sraddha is like a birth of a new-born baby girl, Srila Prabhupada says, “I have impregnated you and now a baby girl (faith) is taking birth.” Because Prabhupada is potent, therefore, he can impregnate or awaken that faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOur whole method of preaching Krsna consciousness is based on awakening faith. Lord Nityananda, the original spiritual master, by His method of distributing Krsna consciousness awakened faith in the hearts of those who previously had no faith. He awakened faith in Jagai and Madhai, he awakened faith in Lord Caitanya to Jagai and Madhai because His method itself was to awaken that faith, because the method was so purely motivated, no tinge of karma and jnana, no personal interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLord Nityananda and Haridasa Thakura are like two patrolmen who go out on Ajna Tahal. They wander about the streets begging everybody, “Please chant Krsna’s names, serve Krsna, make Krsna’s teachings your life.” Wherever they go, this was their message. Lord Caitanya sent them out on sankirtana every day. When He sent them out He said, “Every day you come back from sankirtana and give me your results.” Lord Caitanya was an original sankirtana leader sending Nityananda and Haridasa out on sankirtana every day and said, “Tell me who chanted Krsna’s name today.” Haridasa Thakura and Nityananda would go out with His order on their heads begging others to please chant Krsna’s name.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThey had no other motive except to serve the order of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Therefore their method of distribution was so pure that it awakened faith. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says in the Vaisnava-siddhanta-mala that this type of patrolling has to be performed. One shouldn’t go out asking for milk and rice. This will not awaken faith. Nityananda awakened faith because the only result He wanted to offer to Lord Caitanya were those who were chanting Krsna’s names.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe would cry, sometimes He would fall on the ground with tears on His eyes, “Please chant Krsna’s name.” Just seeing that awakened faith. Such is the power of pure Vaisnavas. Not only do they speak but their words impregnated them in such a way that it awakened faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada said in that lecture, “I have created your faith.” Of course, the potential is already there within the heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tnitya-siddha krsna-prema ‘sadhya' kabhu naya<br />\n\tsravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya (CC Madhya 22.107)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPure love for Krsna is eternally situated within the heart of every living being. It doesn’t come from any other source. sravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya. When one hears about Krsna from the right source, it’s brought out. Prabhupada says, “The catalyst has to be there to bring it out. Just like fire is in the wood, it’s lying dormant, but unless you touch it with the catalyst, you can’t bring it out. Pure love is situated in the heart but it needs a catalyst to bring it out.” Prabhupada said in this lecture, “I have given you this faith.” His words were potent with prema-bhakti. His words were potent with love for Krsna. Coming in contact with his words and seeing his example was such a totally consistent experience that you couldn’t help but have faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, one had to have adhikara as well. But even if one didn’t have adhikara, Prabhupada still had that potency to awaken faith in those who didn’t even know … (a short pause in the recording). Therefore he spoke only about devotional service. Of course, you sometimes hear in his conversations that Prabhupada would talk about many other topics, but he always brought it to the siddhanta and he was always prepared to speak uncompromisingly to anyone about siddhanta. Prabhupada wouldn’t mince words. He would speak boldly.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBhaktivinoda Thakura gives this example that shraddha, faith, when it’s awakened within the heart, is like the birth of a new-born baby-girl. When a girl takes her birth, the mother has to be very careful to protect her. She protects her from heat and cold, hunger and thirst and from dangerous creatures. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, “Just as mother protects a new-born girl, she also gives nourishment, pusti. Simultaneously along with protecting, the mother continues to nourish the child to give strength to fight off these bad elements themselves. In this same way, sraddha, faith in pure devotional service, is established within the heart.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSrila Prabhupada says in Caitanya Caritamrita, “There are many seeds that can be planted within the heart.” For instance, there’s the karma-bija, the jnana-bija and so many other bijas. But in Sri Caitanya’s instructions to Srila Rupa Goswami He speaks about bhakti-lata-bija. Bhakti-lata-bija is the seed of pure devotional service. When that seed of pure devotional service is planted and awakened, then nourishment has to continue. What does nourishment mean? It means that one has to continue hearing about pure devotional service. And then just as a mother protects her child from heat and cold, hunger and thirst, the guardians of devotional service are supposed to protect our hearts from the influence of karma and jnana.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore Prabhupada often quoted the verse,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tbhukti-mukti-sprha yavat pisaci hrdi vartate\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBhukti is the desire for material enjoyment, and mukti is the desire for liberation. They are like two witches that haunt one like a ghost. As long as these two witches are there in the heart haunting one, one will never taste the bliss of bhakti. Bhakti will always remain a mystery.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe may hear so much about pure bhakti, about the bliss of devotional service. Rupa Goswami makes the comparison that one drop of bhakti can inundate the whole universe. It makes the pleasure derived from jnana to be so insignificant. Srila Prabhupada would quote the verse by Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate<br />\n\t(Sri Caitanya-candramrta 5, Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati Thakura)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne who has, just once, caught a merciful glance of Lord Caitanya then kaivalyam narakayate, liberation for him becomes like hell. tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate, the pleasure of the heavenly planets becomes like a phantasmagoria and the venomous serpents of the senses become like serpents with broken fangs. They no longer have any poisonous effect. Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati gives this example also. He says, “Senses are like venomous serpents. A venomous serpent always looks for an object to strike. Senses are also looking for an object to strike. But if anyone gets a merciful glance of Lord Caitanya, then the venomous serpents of the senses become like serpents with broken fangs.” They no longer have a poisonous effect. And then he says, “visvam purna-sukhayate – the whole universe becomes joyful by that merciful glance. And the positions of Brahma and Indra – they become like insignificant insects.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s one merciful glance of Lord Caitanya. That merciful glance of Lord Caitanya is compared to the awakening of faith in pure bhakti. But that bliss of pure devotional service will always remain a mystery as long as the desires for bhukti and mukti are within the heart. Therefore, one has to be very careful, as Lord Caitanya instructed, to discriminate between the weeds and the devotional creeper. “What is the weed that will choke my devotional plant? How do we get rid of those weeds?” That is the science of devotional service, how to get rid of those weeds. So many instructions are given in the Bhagavatam.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we were having the Bhagavatam class at the Baltic festival last week, we were reading the verses told by Kapiladeva to Devahuti. Lord Kapiladeva told Devahuti,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi<br />\n\tsarva-sanga-vivarjitah<br />\n\tsangas tesv atha te prarthyah<br />\n\tsanga-dosa-hara hi te (SB 3.25.24)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“My mother, o virtuous lady, you have to seek the attachment of those who are always talking about Krsna, who are always talking about pure devotional service. Seek out for their association and become attached to hearing from them. It will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachment.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the science of devotional service. This is the method of cleaning the heart. We can’t eradicate these attachments ourselves. We don’t have the strength to fight maya. Just like, when I had my first test from maya and said, “I can’t do it.” I was foolishly thinking that I was the doer and therefore said, “I can’t do it”. But it did not depend upon me. I can never do it alone. I am always dependent on the mercy of Vaisnavas. ”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s what Lord Kapiladeva is saying also. Lord Kapiladeva says, “You can’t do it. But if you depend on the mercy of Vaisnavas, you can do it because they give you the extra strength to overcome your attachments. All you have to do is to become attached to hearing from them because they are speaking about pure devotional service.” Become attached to hearing about pure devotional service even though, “I know I know. It’s so far away. I can’t do it. It’s too much.” But an honest and sincere person will realize, “These are things I don’t want. I don’t want these attachments. They are dragging me down. I can’t get rid of them myself.” The Bhagavatam says, “Ok. Don’t get rid of your attachments. Feed them.” How do you feed your attachments? Become attached to Vaisnavas. Lord Kapiladeva says, “Every learned person knows that attachment to the material things is the cause of bondage for the living entity but when the same attachment is applied to a self-realized devotee, moksa-dvaram apavrtam, the gates to liberation are open. Don’t give up attachment.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe’ve been reading Queen Kunti’s prayers. Queen Kunti says to Krsna, “You are the property of the materially-impoverished.” Prabhupada says, “The living entity is finished as soon as he has nothing to possess. Everyone has to possess something. He is finished if he has nothing to possess.” It’s the symptom of life to possess something. The first words Prabhupada says right there in the commentary, “The living entity is finished as soon as he has nothing to possess.” Everybody who hears this says, “Wow! Prabhupada knows my heart. He knows that I have to possess something.” Of course, Prabhupada goes on to explain what the most valuable possession is. The most valuable possession is when one possesses Krsna within the core of his heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Prabhupada says, “Don’t give up your attachments. Change your attachments. Become attached to hearing from Vaisnavas.” Lord Kapiladeva says the same thing in the Bhagavatam, “If you become attached to Vaisnavas, this will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachment.” It’s not that, “I’ll give it up by myself.” We can’t give it up ourselves. That’s what the impersonalists try to do. Due to intense frustration, impersonalists say “I give it up.” They try to renounce everything. But Lord Brahma says that you can’t become fully liberated by such a method of giving up. He says “You’ll fall down from that position of imagined superiority because you never become attached to Krsna’s lotus feet.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the symptom of life is to be attached. The Vaisnavas are so kind that they are giving us what we should be attached to even before we realize it, even before we have the desire to want it. They are giving it even before we’ve asked for it. Prabhupada says, “That’s the method of distribution.” Lord Caitanya says, “Take!” Previously when Krsna came, He said, “Abandon all varieties of religions and surrender unto Me.” When Krsna came, He said, “First surrender and then I’ll deliver you from sinful reactions.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when Lord Caitanya came, He said, “Take!” All conditions removed. “Take this Holy Name of the Lord. Take this pure devotional service. Take it, make it your life. Take the Holy name but chant it sincerely. Serve the holy name. The Holy name will eradicate, will cleanse all the desires within your heart.” Without any previous qualification someone came and said, “Take!” Just like my Godbrother Kesava who gave me that tape, “Take.” I took it. No questions asked. I didn’t say, “I don’t deserve it.” I was greedy. I took it. I listened to it every day.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is Lord Caitanya’s method of helping us to overcome our attachments. If we don’t take, we won’t advance. There’s plenty to take but we have to take it. The Bhagavatam says,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah<br />\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah<br />\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani<br />\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam (SB 1.2.17)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul in the heart of all living entities, cleanses the desire for material enjoyment from the heart of that person who developed the urge to take.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s what Bhagavatam says. Just develop the urge to take. Don’t ask, \"Why should I take it?\" Don’t fight. Just take it. What happens then? The more we take, the more we begin to see that pure devotional service and we see the other things that start to come to the surface of our hearts. The Bhagavatam says, “That’s OK. Just keep on taking.” But we think, “I don’t know. These things that are coming up in my heart they are consuming me. How can I think about taking? I might lose. If I keep on taking and taking, Krsna in my heart might take too. He might take something away that I didn’t give Him. I’m going to protect this. Because if I keep hearing about pure devotional service, when I might not be looking, Krsna might take something away. So, I have to keep watching. Krsna, I’m holding on to it so You won’t take it. But if I keep on hearing how You are going to take my attachments away from me, that’s too disturbing. Maybe I should hear from people who are going to tell me I can keep them. Let me hear from those who talk about karma and jnana. I’m not ready for pure bhakti yet. Let me hear about these other things that let me feel more comfortable about my attachments.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf one is not careful, he abandons hearing about pure devotional service or he could lose his taste.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tbhogaisvarya-prasaktanam<br />\n\ttayapahrta-cetasam<br />\n\tvyavasayatmika buddhih<br />\n\tsamadhau na vidhiyate (Bg 2.44)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“In the minds of those who are too much attached to material opulence and sense enjoyment and who are bewildered by such things, there’s no resolute determination to take to pure bhakti.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna is warning us that if we refuse to keep on taking the medicine of pure devotional service, the urge to go on hearing these messages will gradually wane within the heart. One can lose taste or one can begin to think that there are many other tastes that are nicer right now. “I’ll come back to this other taste some other time.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Narada Muni was already way ahead of you. When he told Vyasadeva to compile the Bhagavatam he already knew that some people would think like this. Therefore, in order to convince Vyasa to compile the Bhagavatam, he told him, “Those who forsake their material occupational duties in order to take pure devotional service may fall down at an immature stage, but there’s no danger of being unsuccessful. On the other hand, even though a non-devotee is perfectly engaged in his occupational duties, he doesn’t gain anything.” He says, “My dear Vyasa, even though a devotee of Lord Krsna sometimes falls down somehow or other he cannot become a fruitive worker again because anyone who once has had the taste of Krsna’s lotus feet will never be able to forget that ecstasy.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe may try. We may try very hard. We may do so many things to try to forget, but it won’t last permanently. Sooner or later it will bring us back to Krsna’s lotus feet. But of course, a foolish person should never try to lose the shelter of Krsna’s lotus feet. If one tries to forget the shelter of Krsna’s lotus feet and wanders about into all other activities, it will only lead to suffering. That’s all. An intelligent person should avoid these things.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Prabhupada would oftentimes quote the verse from Caitanya Caritamrita, “My devotee engages in devotional service but at the same time he wants to taste something else too. Why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him take shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget these things.” Therefore, Krsna fulfills the desires of His devotees in such a way that a devotee will come back and never ask for it again. This is not very intelligent.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada says in the Sixth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam that an intelligent person learns from hearing. The less intelligent person hears, but thinks, “I’ll still do it.” He could have avoided the suffering but he thinks, “I’ll still do it.” The least intelligent person has heard, he is punished, he suffers but he will still do it again. Therefore, one should become intelligent. An intelligent person will simply go on hearing even though his heart is filled with desires and attachments. “Just go on hearing the glories of pure devotional service. It will give you the strength to overcome all of the attachment that are there within your heart. Don’t lose hope and don’t give it up.” It will act.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada says just like fire burns. A child may not know that the fire burns but when the child touches the fire, it burns. The fire doesn’t think, “This is a child. I won’t burn him.” No, it will act. In the same way, hearing the glories of pure devotional service will act.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to add just by reading one verse. It’s the verse from the Bhagavatam I quoted the other day where Srila Prabhupada speaks about this point in Srila Prabhupada’s own unique way. Prabhupada has a way with words. It’s his trademark.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s the verse from the Fifth Canto of the Bhagavatam. The verse speaks about pure devotees and what happens in an assembly of pure devotees. It’s the verse from the Fifth Canto, Chapter 12, Text 13. Who are the pure devotees mentioned here?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tyatrottamasloka-gunanuvadah<br />\n\tprastuyate gramya-katha-vighatah<br />\n\tnisevyamano 'nudinam mumuksor<br />\n\tmatim satim yacchati vasudeve\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Who are the pure devotees mentioned here? In an assembly of pure devotees, there is no question of discussing material subjects like politics and sociology. In an assembly of pure devotees, there is discussion only of the qualities, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is praised and worshiped with full attention. In the association of pure devotees, by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vāsudeva.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe symptoms of pure devotees are described in this verse. The pure devotee is never interested in material topics. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has strictly prohibited His devotees to talk about worldly matters. Gramya-varta na kahibe: one should not indulge in talking unnecessarily about news of the material world. One should not waste time in this way. This is a very important feature in the life of a devotee. A devotee has no other ambition than to serve Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was started to engage people twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord and in His glorification. The students in this institution engage in the cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness from five in the morning to ten at night. They actually have no opportunity to waste their time unnecessarily by discussing politics, sociology and current events. This will go their own way. A devotee is concerned only with serving Kṛṣṇa positively and seriously.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPURPORT by Niranjana Swami\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPrabhupada says in many places (I can show you so many places) in the Bhagavatam that our Krsna consciousness movement is established for this purpose. It was established for Hari-katha. Devotees understand the importance of regularly hearing Hari-katha, the glories of pure devotional service. When they actually make it their daily nourishment, they will see that this is the method of dealing with all of those attachments. “Just go on hearing. Don’t give it up. Don’t think there are some other topics that are more important.” These are the most important topics for those who are aspiring for Krsna’s lotus feet. Of course, if we are not aspiring for Krsna’s lotus feet, we’ll find many other topics to hear about. But those who are aspiring for Krsna’s lotus feet will see that these topics will gradually bring us to Krsna’s lotus feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Lord Brahma says anyone who has faith in hearing these topics or, as Lord Krsna says to Uddhava, “Having awakened faith in hearing narrations of Krsna, being disgusted with material life, knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering but still not able to give it up this is My devotee should simply remain happy and continue serving Me with faith. Because My devotee knows that all sense gratification leads to suffering because he has awakened faith in hearing these narrations - he will sincerely repent in his heart for his inability to give it up.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s the symptom of a devotee – he sincerely repents within his heart for his inability to give it up. He prays to Krsna, “Please help me to eradicate these attachments.” He doesn’t justify them in his heart. “Oh, no, actually these things are more important.” He knows, “I have to give these things up. I can’t do it alone. I’m completely dependent on Krsna’s mercy and completely dependent on the mercy of Vaisnavas to clean my heart who are very mercifully giving me the Holy name and who are watering the Holy name by discussing the glories of the Holy name.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Caitanya Caritamrita it is stated that one should learn the truth and the beauty of the Holy name by hearing the revealed scriptures from the mouths of Vaisnavas. There’s no other way to taste the sweetness of Krsna’s Holy name. Prabhupada is doing this for us in his beautiful, beautiful commentaries to Srimad Bhagavatam. His lectures are like nectar. Have all of you read this book? Is there anyone who hasn’t read this book? Nectar! Take it. Hare Krsna. Thank you very much.\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tMy dear Abhyarci devi dasi,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlease accept my blessings. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYesterday, March 7, 2014, you left this world surrounded by so many loving devotees, loudly chanting Krsna's names. As I was standing next to you, chanting and simultaneously hearing the kirtan, chanted so loudly and with such great fervor, I was reflecting on the letter you wrote to me early last year.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong the many beautiful thoughts you shared with me in that letter, you mentioned a conversation you had with a devoteee in Kolkata, the same day you were diagnosed with cancer. Although this devotee knew nothing yet about the diagnosis (because other than yourself and your husband, nobody else was told what the doctors had said) he asked you the following question:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Where were you born?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn your letter, you wrote that you replied, \"Oh, it is small place near Herson. No one knows it. I was born there, but it is not important. What is important is where I'll die, I hope not at the place where I was born. I hope I'll die in Mayapur.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis devotee then quickly responded with the following prophetic words (exactly as you had written them to me):\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Oh, of course, Abhyarchi, no doubt that you will be dying in Mayapur, beautifully and solemnly, and we all will sing an ecstatic kirtan for you, and you'll leave us during this kirtan, and we will take your body to the Ganga, we will burn it on her bank and we will sing and cry in separation of you. But at the same time we all will be very happy, because we'll be absolutely sure that you returned home to your eternal service to Krsna and you'll never come back here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd then, again, in your own words, you shared with me your reaction to what you had just heard:,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"I almost choked from the tears of delight! And with a deep gratitude I accepted this blessing of a devotee[…]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[…]I remembered how I prayed to Krsna to help me become serious in my spiritual life and understood that Krsna is answering my prayers now...\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust a few hours ago, I returned from the funeral pyre, upon which your body, decorated with the most peaceful smile on your face, was placed. While standing along the banks of Mother Ganges, watching the fire gradually consume your body, I was again loudly singing Krsna's names along with the many devotees who accompanied us on the procession.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis time, however, I was reflecting on how Krsna fulfilled your wishes. You asked Krsna to help you become serious in your spiritual life and you became so much more serious. You also told that devotee, \"I hope I'll die in Mayapura.\" Not only did you leave this world in Mayapura, but you left in a very auspicious way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course, none of us expected that all this would happen so soon. In fact, we were not prepared. But it seems to me that you were.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tReflecting on the conversations we've had since you first learned about your cancer, I recall only one topic which seemed important to you every time we met. \"How can I become more attached to the Holy Name?\" You were uninterested to talk with me about your bodily pains, your disease, your treatments, and rarely about anything else connected to this material world. And your only complaint was, \"I'm not attached enough to the Holy Name.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was proud of you then, remain very proud of you now, and I wish everyone to know how proud of you I am. Today I was also able to see you not only as my disciple, but also as my teacher. You taught me how important it is detach ourselves from this material world by deepening our attachment to the holy name.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI pray that, by Lord Nityananda's mercy, there was not the slightest trace of material anxiety or desire within your heart and that the devotee's prophetic words will all be fulfilled. May you enter into the dancing party of Radha and Krsna and forever remain in Their service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlways,<br />\r\n\tYour well-wisher,<br />\r\n\tNiranjana Swami\r\n</p>\r\n",

One must follow strictly the instruction of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu given in the Śikṣaṣṭaka (3):\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttṛṇad api su-nacena taror iva sahiṣṇuna<br />\r\n\tamanina mana-dena kirtaniyaḥ sada hariḥ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[Cc. Adi 17.31]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"One should chant the Holy Name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the Holy Name of the Lord constantly.\" One who follows this direction, being freed from the ten kinds of offenses, becomes successful in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and ultimately reaches the platform of loving service to the Personality of Godhead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne must come to the understanding that the Holy Name of the Lord and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself are identical. One cannot reach this conclusion unless one is offenseless in chanting the Holy Name. By our material calculation we see a difference between the name and the substance, but in the spiritual world the Absolute is always absolute: the name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Absolute are all as good as the Absolute Himself. Thus one is understood to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he considers himself an eternal servant of the Holy Name and in this spirit distributes the Holy Name to the world. One who chants in that spirit, without offenses, is certainly elevated to the platform of understanding that the Holy Name and the Personality of Godhead are identical. To associate with the Holy Name and chant the Holy Name is to associate with the Personality of Godhead directly. In the Bhakti-rasamṛta-sindhu it is clearly said, sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. The Holy Name becomes manifest when one engages in the service of the Holy Name. This service in a submissive attitude begins with one's tongue. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau: One must engage his tongue in the service of the Holy Name. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on this principle. We try to engage all the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the service of the Holy Name. Since the Holy Name and Kṛṣṇa are nondifferent, the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement not only chant the Holy Name of the Lord offenselessly, but also do not allow their tongues to eat anything that is not first offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord declares:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tpatram puṣpam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati<br />\r\n\ttad aham bhakty-upahṛtam asnami prayatatmanaḥ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.\" (Bg. 9.26) Therefore the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has many temples all over the world, and in each and every temple the Lord is offered these foods. On the basis of His demands, the devotees chant the Holy Name of the Lord offenselessly and never eat anything that is not first offered to the Lord. The functions of the tongue in devotional service are to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra and eat prasādam that is offered to the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHH Niranjana Swami Maharaja:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tom ajnana-timirandhasya<br />\r\n\tjnananjana-salakaya<br />\r\n\tcaksur unmilitam yena<br />\r\n\ttasmai sri-gurave namah\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tmukam karoti vachalam<br />\r\n\tpangum langhayate girim<br />\r\n\tyat-kripa tam aham vande<br />\r\n\tshri-gurum dina-taranam\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnama om visnu-padaya krsna-presthaya bhu-tale<br />\r\n\tsrimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine<br />\r\n\tnamas te sarasvate deve gaura-vani-pracarine<br />\r\n\tnirvisesa -sunyavadi-pascatya-desa-tarine\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tjaya sri-krishna-chaitanya prabhu nityananda<br />\r\n\tsri-adwaita gadadhara shrivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrinda\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna Hare Kṛṣṇa<br />\r\n\tKṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare<br />\r\n\tHare Rāma Hare Rāma<br />\r\n\tRāma Rāma Hare Hare\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore I begin, I’d like to say that it is a great honor for me to be given this opportunity to render some service to all the assembled Vaishnavas today. I pray, that you’ll give me your blessings so that I may say something relevant especially since I have been asked to speak about the Holy Name, since today is the last day of our kirtan mela. The devotees have assembled here to dive deeply into the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord. I need your blessings to say something relevant to such a deep topic. Therefore, I offer my obeisances to all my godbrothers<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tvancha-kalpatarubhyash cha<br />\r\n\tkripa-sindhubhya eva cha<br />\r\n\tpatitanam pavanebhyo<br />\r\n\tvaishnavebhyo namo namaha\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\twho have assembled here. Thank you very much.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this verse, importance is stressed about chanting the Holy Name so that one can achieve the ultimate goal of this chanting. I wanted to read something also in connection to this. It is short but very relevant to this verse. In the words of our param guru Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, in answer to the question, ‘how should we chant the Lord’s Holy Names’. I find this very relevant to myself and therefore I’ve been sharing it with many devotees and I would like to read it first and then in some way try to be able to explain the meaning behind it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Maharaja begins reading)<br />\r\n\t“Pure devotees do not chant the Lords Names to counteract sinful reactions, accumulate piety, attain heavenly pleasures, to mitigate famine, devastating epidemics, social unrest, disease, civil strife or to obtain wealth or an earthly kingdom. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to ask Him to fulfill our wishes is to treat Him as our servant. This is an offense. Therefore calling the Lords Names for any reason other than to attain His devotional service is useless. Jesus Christ told us not to take the Lords name in vain. However this does not mean that we do not need to always chant the Lords Names, while sleeping, awake, eating or enjoying happiness, to chant the Lords Names, begging for His service is not a useless activity, it is our only duty. But to make a show of chanting for some other purpose in other words to fulfill our own desire is useless. We should not take to the chanting of the Lords Names uselessly. We should not chant to attain religiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation instead we should always chant to attain the Lords service.”<br />\r\n\t(Maharaja ends reading)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI thought this was very relevant. Many times when we are sitting engaged in kirtan, engaged in japa, we try to hold on to something that we should be praying for and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur here explains, that unless one is actually chanting for service, any other purpose, any other purpose and he gives a long list, not for social unrest, not for epidemics, not for material prosperity, any chanting to relieve distress, whether individually or collectively is materially motivated. And therefore, he uses a strong word, he says it’s useless which we may question, because sometimes we hear so many verses which explain that even once chanting the Holy Names of the Lord will eradicate all kinds of sinful reactions for millions of births. And here somebody may be chanting, collectively with a large group, for a particular purpose, yet he defines it as useless chanting. It makes me think of a verse in the Srimad Bhagavatam, in the 3rd Canto, spoken by Devahuti. She says that anyone whose work does not lead to religious life and any one whose religious, ritualistic performances do not elevate one to renunciation and anyone who is situated in renunciation that doesn’t lead to devotional service to the Supreme Lord, is to be considered to be a dead body, although breathing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere, in this verse, emphasis is given on the ultimate goal. Unless the ultimate goal is reached, which is the essence of today’s verse, if we want to actually achieve the ultimate goal of chanting, we have to become free from offenses. And unless the ultimate goal is achieved, which is devotional service to the Supreme Lord, any other achievement is useless. Because the only full achievement of chanting the Holy Name of the Lord, is to achieve love for the Supreme Lord. Love which is freed from all material desires.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tanyabhilasita-sunyam<br />\r\n\tjnana-karmady-anavrtam\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tas Srila Rupa Goswami explains, that such devotional service should be freed from the influence of karma and jnana. And Srila Rupa Goswami also states that<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tbhukti-mukti-spṛha yavat<br />\r\n\tpisaci hṛdi vartate\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe says as long as the desire for bhukti, the desire for material enjoyment, mukti, the desire for relief from suffering, liberation, as long as these two desires that are within the heart, which are considered to be like two witches, which haunt one like a ghost, then one will never be able to taste the bliss of devotional service to the Supreme Lord. And therefore it is stated in Caitanya Caritamrita that the goal of chanting is to achieve this love. And Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur here also states that to approach the Lord for something for ourselves, he says it’s an offense. We should not ask anything for ourselves. He says, therefore all these other purposes for which one chants are considered to be useless, unless we actually, purposely, with intent sit and intensely very much pray for service to the Lord. That service, that opportunity to engage in devotional service, is bestowed by the mercy of the Lord and also bestowed by the mercy of the devotee of the Lord. Therefore, in examining these statements, both here in this commentary by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta and here in Srila Prabhupadas commentary, he gives the siddha pranali, which is, that if one wants to be successful in chanting, he quotes the verse that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur emphasizes is the siddha pranali for Gaudiya Vaishnavas which is<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\ttṛṇad api su-nacena taror iva sahiṣṇuna<br />\r\n\tamanina mana-dena kirtaniyaḥ sada hariḥ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tand Lord Caitanya Himself, has stated when explaining this verse. He says that a devotee who is engaged in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord, he does not retaliate, even if he is rebuked or chastised. He never retaliates or says anything to anyone else about such activity. He says, and he gives an example that, even if a tree is cut, the tree will not complain and even if the tree is drying up, it will not ask anyone for water. And He says that such forbearance must be practiced by the devotee. Thus a Vaishnava should engage in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord and he should never ask anyone for anything for himself. If someone offers, He will accept, but if someone doesn’t offer, he is satisfied to accept whatever comes by its own means. But then He says something very very important. He says, this type of devotional service solidly maintains, this type of behavior solidly maintains a devotees devotional service. This type of behavior. He doesn’t ask, he tolerates. So forbearing! There is a verse in the Srimad Bhagavatam,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\ttiraskṛta vipralabdhaḥ<br />\r\n\tsaptaḥ kṣipta hata api<br />\r\n\tnasya tat pratikurvanti<br />\r\n\ttad-bhaktaḥ prabhavo 'pi hi\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis verse is spoken about Parikshit Maharaja. It was spoken by Samika rishi, when he learnt that his son had garlanded a snake around Parikshit Maharajas neck. He was extremely disturbed, because he understood that Parikshit Maharaja, is such a saintly Vaishnava. In his heart he was thinking, if only Parikshit Maharaja would counteract what has happened to him by cursing my son, then that will be proper just punishment for him. But then he realised, wait a minute:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\ttiraskṛta vipralabdhaḥ<br />\r\n\tsaptaḥ kṣipta hata api\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow will it be possible? Parikshit Maharaja wouldn’t do that. Because, devotees of the Lord are so forbearing, that even if they are cheated, cursed, neglected, disturbed, insulted or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves. What can I do? Parikshit Maharaja will never counter curse. I can only simply pray to the Lord, that somehow He sees the situation and He understands what needs to be done to correct the situation, because Parikshit Maharaja will never counteract or counter curse my son. Such is the characteristic of a devotee. A devotee is so forbearing. Cheated, cursed, neglected, insulted, insulted, disturbed or even killed!&nbsp; But will never avenge himself. Why? Why? Because he is so forbearing, he is so tolerant! This type of devotional service, this type of mood in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord as Lord Caitanya Himself states, this behavior solidly maintains devotional service for the devotee. It gives him the means by which he can actually be situated in devotional service, because he is so tolerant that the Lord cannot neglect! Others may neglect, but the Lord will not neglect.&nbsp; How can the Lord neglect such a devotee? He cannot neglect. He cannot turn away. Look what happened to Ambarish Maharaja?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Ambarish Maharaja was cursed, he didn’t even pray to the Lord for protection but the Lord protected him. And when Durvasa Muni came to the Lord, first he went to Lord Brahma, he went to Lord Shiva, then he went to Lord Vishnu. Of course Brahma and Shiva they were not able to provide him relief, because that’s what he wanted, he wanted relief.&nbsp; Please relieve me.&nbsp; Brahma says I can’t, Lord Shiva says I can’t and then he came to Lord Vishnu, he says, “Please look at me I am suffering”.&nbsp; Then Lord Vishnu says, “Sorry, I can’t do anything to help you”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur in his commentaries to these verses, he explains the mood the Lord has in His conversation with Durvasa Muni.&nbsp; When Durvasa Muni, he approaches the Lord for protection and he says, “Please can you mitigate my distress? You have invoked this chakra, certainly you can remove it”.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord says, “I am sorry, I am not independent. I am completely under the control of my devotee. The devotee is always in My heart and I am always in the heart of My devotee. The devotee doesn’t think of anyone but Me and I don’t think of anyone but him”.&nbsp; And then what does Durvasa Muni say? He says: “Certainly, when You see somebody suffering and they are coming to You for protection, certainly you must be inclined to feel for his suffering”.&nbsp; He’s begging, “Please have a heart and the Lord says, “Sorry! Actually I can’t even think of your suffering.&nbsp; I don’t have a heart and I can’t even think of your suffering”. Durvasa Muni says, “How is it possible?” And then the Lord explains, He says: “My devotee is so dear to Me. He is my devotee because He always takes me into the core of his heart and he is always praying to Me please let me engage in Your service. He doesn’t want anything else. He’s always thinking how he can serve Me. So therefore I approach My devotee and I say, please let Me give you something. But My devotee says, ‘I don’t want anything”. And the Lord says, “I want to give you something, anything”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust like He told Kholaveca Sridhar, he was always chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. People would complain. He said, “Kholaveca, I’ll make you a king.&nbsp; I’ll give you a kingdom”. Kholaveca says: “No!&nbsp; You simply be my Lord and master and let me be Your servant birth after birth”. So the Lord explains, He says, “My devotee only asks for one thing, let me serve You! So therefore, how can I give him anything, he doesn’t want? But still I must give him something. I must give him something which is valuable. Something which he’ll appreciate or value. Something that will mean something for him. He doesn’t want wealth. He doesn’t want follower. He doesn’t want beautiful women. He doesn’t want anything from me. But let me give him something that he’ll accept. So what do I give him.&nbsp; I give him My heart. My devotee has my heart. And you are asking me have a heart! And I am saying, I am sorry. I don’t have one. I can’t even think. My devotee has My mind, he has My heart. You want My heart, You have to go to him”.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Lord is so much inclined, He can’t neglect a devotee who is always fully depending upon Him. And therefore, when a devotee chants the Holy Name of the Lord in this mentality. It nourishes, it sustains, solidly maintains a devotees devotional service, so much so, that the Lord gives him the greatest benediction. Not only gives His heart, gives Himself, but He gives His devotee His devotional service, which is the means for perfection.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf one sits and meditates and chants the Holy Names of the Lord, yes, we may want to go back home back to godhead, we want to actually take shelter in the spiritual world, but actually that place can be obtained only by those who think first and foremost, service. It’s not achieved by anything else. Only if one actually has this attitude, this complete helpless dependence, ‘Oh Lord please engage me in Your service’.&nbsp; Therefore we must understand that this devotional service to enter into the spiritual world can only be achieved when one actually gets the mercy of the Lord's devotee.&nbsp; And therefore, it is stated by Srila Narattoma Das Thakur, he says that “When will Lord Nityananda's mercy be fully manifest to me, so that material desires will become so completely insignificant, when will that time come?” And he says, “When my mind is completely purified, completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires, then and only then, will I be able to understand Sri Vrindavan dham and the conjugal love of Sri Radha and Krishna and only then will my spiritual life be successful”.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe explains that, “Yes, I have to get the mercy of the greatest servant of Lord Caitanya who is Lord Nityananda. It is Lord Nityananda who actually cleanses the heart. Gives one spiritual strength. Gives one the strength to actually become free from all these material obstacles, the desire for wealth, the desire for relief from suffering, the desire for material enjoyment”. In the Srimad Bhagavatam it is stated by Narada Muni, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to those devotees who have no material possessions and who are fully satisfied in possessing only devotional service to the Supreme Lord.&nbsp; Indeed the Lord relishes the activities of such devotees. Those who are puffed up by respectable parentage, by great opulence, by bodily beauty, they’re generally proud of possessing such things. And even if they offer the Lord worship, he says the Lord is not inclined to accept it. Why? Because they deride the devotee of the Lord. When they see the devotee, who is so fully dependent upon the mercy of the Lord, they deride the devotee. Just like Kholaveca Sridhar, the worshipers of goddess Chandi, they saw how Kholaveca Sridhar was so absorbed in chanting, but they would deride him. ‘Why don’t you worship goddess Chandi? Look at us we are wealthy, and look at you, you live in a hut, your roof, there are so many holes in it. You are crying at night, all night long with hunger pains, disturbing all your neighbors. Why don’t you take shelter?’&nbsp; But what was Kholaveca Sridhar’s mood?&nbsp; His mood was completely calling out the Names of the Lord. Only for one purpose, only for one purpose, to glorify the Lord, to be engaged in the service of the Lord. Such devotional service, such behavior, solidly maintains a devotees devotional service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLord Nityananda is very merciful and therefore as we understand, if we want to enter into the dancing party of Radha and Krsna we have to catch hold of the feet of Lord Nityananda and only then will we be qualified to enter into the spiritual world.&nbsp; It is Lord Nityananda who showed by His example, how to take the order of the Supreme Lord and to tolerate all kinds of inconveniences. It was Lord Nityananda who took the order of Lord Caitanya, who told Him go out every day into the streets, and then induce others to chant Krsna's names, to tell others about Krsna, make Krsna your life and then you come back in the evening and you tell me how many people have been chanting?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat is Lord Nityananda begging for? He was begging to give others the opportunity to understand what is the real meaning of the Holy Name of the Lord and therefore His method of distribution was so glorious, so glorious that by His method of distribution He will awaken faith in others. This is what He was looking for; He was not looking for anything else.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakur says that when patrolman Haridas Thakur and Lord Nityananda went into the streets, They did not go out for any selfish purpose, begging for milk and rice. They simply went out for one reason, carrying the order of the Lord on their heads and begging everyone, even in the face of all kinds of adversities. Being struck in the head with a pot by Madhai, still He was so merciful. So merciful.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe was thinking that “Yes, if I can make these two personalities understand Lord Caitanya, then I will be recognized as Lord Caitanyas servant”. So it is Lord Nityananda, and the servant of Lord Nityananda who gives us the opportunity to engage in service and not only in chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, but to cleanse the heart, to purify the heart from all material anxieties and desires, so that one can be qualified to enter into Sri Vrindavan Dham. Then we’ll be able to enter into the dancing party of Radha and Krishna.&nbsp; Then we’ll actually be able to approach Radha and Krishna by catching tightly, firmly holding the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda. This way we understand that we have gathered here to chant, collectively, we are chanting, praying for the opportunity to serve. That is our shelter! That is our means for perfection. That is our means for actually pleasing the Lord and becoming qualified to enter into the spiritual world and to enter that transcendental abode and thereby become qualified.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta actually explains in the harmonist magazine, he explains something very important. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur says that when Lord Nityananda especially favors a devotee and when He deems His devotee fit for rendering service to Srimati Radhika, He offers that devotee for Her service. Srimati Radharani is the Guru of the inner circle and Lord Nityananda, He is the Guru for the masses. It is Lord Nityananda who actually goes out to the masses and by His method of distribution awakens faith in devotional service, pure devotional service. Not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord for relief of distress, not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord to become free from epidemics, not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord for elevation to the heavenly planets. By chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, His meditation was only one thing only, His meditation was service to Lord Caitanya. He did not even go out and distribute until He received the order from Lord Caitanya although He traveled on pilgrimage for 20 years, He waited until He came here, to the house of Nandan Acharya and then when He came here and received the order, then He took it up. It is the order!&nbsp; That is our method of service to the Holy Name. And Srila Prabhupada explains that in today’s purport. Very important and I’ll end with this because I see a sign here that says very important, class must end by 8:45am.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrabhupada says, “Thus one is understood to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he considers himself an eternal servant of the Holy Name and in this spirit distributes the Holy Name to the world. One who chants in that spirit, without offenses”. Without offenses, as we said today, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur said any other purpose for chanting, other than for service is offensive, because it is asking something for myself. So he says, “One who chants in that spirit, without offenses, is certainly elevated to the platform of understanding that the Holy Name and the Personality of Godhead are identical. To associate with the Holy Name and chant the Holy Name is to associate with the Personality of Godhead directly”.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tkali-kale naam-rupe krishna-avatara<br />\r\n\tnama haite haya sarva-jagat-nistara\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is stated in the Caitanya Caritamrita that in the age of the kali the Supreme Lord appears in the form of His Holy Name. Anyone who associates with the Holy Name is as good as associating with the Lord directly and certainly he is delivered.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI have to end here. Thank you very much for your kind attention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHare Krsna!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tApplause!\r\n</p>\r\n",

One must follow strictly the instruction of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu given in the Śikṣaṣṭaka (3):\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttṛṇad api su-nacena taror iva sahiṣṇuna<br />\n\tamanina mana-dena kirtaniyaḥ sada hariḥ\n</p>\n<p>\n\t[Cc. Adi 17.31]\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"One should chant the Holy Name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the Holy Name of the Lord constantly.\" One who follows this direction, being freed from the ten kinds of offenses, becomes successful in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and ultimately reaches the platform of loving service to the Personality of Godhead.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne must come to the understanding that the Holy Name of the Lord and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself are identical. One cannot reach this conclusion unless one is offenseless in chanting the Holy Name. By our material calculation we see a difference between the name and the substance, but in the spiritual world the Absolute is always absolute: the name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Absolute are all as good as the Absolute Himself. Thus one is understood to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he considers himself an eternal servant of the Holy Name and in this spirit distributes the Holy Name to the world. One who chants in that spirit, without offenses, is certainly elevated to the platform of understanding that the Holy Name and the Personality of Godhead are identical. To associate with the Holy Name and chant the Holy Name is to associate with the Personality of Godhead directly. In the Bhakti-rasamṛta-sindhu it is clearly said, sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. The Holy Name becomes manifest when one engages in the service of the Holy Name. This service in a submissive attitude begins with one's tongue. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau: One must engage his tongue in the service of the Holy Name. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on this principle. We try to engage all the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the service of the Holy Name. Since the Holy Name and Kṛṣṇa are nondifferent, the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement not only chant the Holy Name of the Lord offenselessly, but also do not allow their tongues to eat anything that is not first offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord declares:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tpatram puṣpam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati<br />\n\ttad aham bhakty-upahṛtam asnami prayatatmanaḥ\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.\" (Bg. 9.26) Therefore the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has many temples all over the world, and in each and every temple the Lord is offered these foods. On the basis of His demands, the devotees chant the Holy Name of the Lord offenselessly and never eat anything that is not first offered to the Lord. The functions of the tongue in devotional service are to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra and eat prasādam that is offered to the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHH Niranjana Swami Maharaja:\n</p>\n<p>\n\tom ajnana-timirandhasya<br />\n\tjnananjana-salakaya<br />\n\tcaksur unmilitam yena<br />\n\ttasmai sri-gurave namah\n</p>\n<p>\n\tmukam karoti vachalam<br />\n\tpangum langhayate girim<br />\n\tyat-kripa tam aham vande<br />\n\tshri-gurum dina-taranam\n</p>\n<p>\n\tnama om visnu-padaya krsna-presthaya bhu-tale<br />\n\tsrimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine<br />\n\tnamas te sarasvate deve gaura-vani-pracarine<br />\n\tnirvisesa -sunyavadi-pascatya-desa-tarine\n</p>\n<p>\n\tjaya sri-krishna-chaitanya prabhu nityananda<br />\n\tsri-adwaita gadadhara shrivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrinda\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna Hare Kṛṣṇa<br />\n\tKṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare<br />\n\tHare Rāma Hare Rāma<br />\n\tRāma Rāma Hare Hare\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I begin, I’d like to say that it is a great honor for me to be given this opportunity to render some service to all the assembled Vaishnavas today. I pray, that you’ll give me your blessings so that I may say something relevant especially since I have been asked to speak about the Holy Name, since today is the last day of our kirtan mela. The devotees have assembled here to dive deeply into the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord. I need your blessings to say something relevant to such a deep topic. Therefore, I offer my obeisances to all my godbrothers</p>\n<p>\tvancha-kalpatarubhyash cha<br />\n\tkripa-sindhubhya eva cha<br />\n\tpatitanam pavanebhyo<br />\n\tvaishnavebhyo namo namaha\n</p>\n<p>\n\twho have assembled here. Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\tIn this verse, importance is stressed about chanting the Holy Name so that one can achieve the ultimate goal of this chanting. I wanted to read something also in connection to this. It is short but very relevant to this verse. In the words of our param guru Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, in answer to the question, ‘how should we chant the Lord’s Holy Names’. I find this very relevant to myself and therefore I’ve been sharing it with many devotees and I would like to read it first and then in some way try to be able to explain the meaning behind it.</p>\n<p>\t(Maharaja begins reading)<br />\n\t“Pure devotees do not chant the Lords Names to counteract sinful reactions, accumulate piety, attain heavenly pleasures, to mitigate famine, devastating epidemics, social unrest, disease, civil strife or to obtain wealth or an earthly kingdom. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to ask Him to fulfill our wishes is to treat Him as our servant. This is an offense. Therefore calling the Lords Names for any reason other than to attain His devotional service is useless. Jesus Christ told us not to take the Lords name in vain. However this does not mean that we do not need to always chant the Lords Names, while sleeping, awake, eating or enjoying happiness, to chant the Lords Names, begging for His service is not a useless activity, it is our only duty. But to make a show of chanting for some other purpose in other words to fulfill our own desire is useless. We should not take to the chanting of the Lords Names uselessly. We should not chant to attain religiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation instead we should always chant to attain the Lords service.”<br />\n\t(Maharaja ends reading)</p>\n<p>\tI thought this was very relevant. Many times when we are sitting engaged in kirtan, engaged in japa, we try to hold on to something that we should be praying for and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur here explains, that unless one is actually chanting for service, any other purpose, any other purpose and he gives a long list, not for social unrest, not for epidemics, not for material prosperity, any chanting to relieve distress, whether individually or collectively is materially motivated. And therefore, he uses a strong word, he says it’s useless which we may question, because sometimes we hear so many verses which explain that even once chanting the Holy Names of the Lord will eradicate all kinds of sinful reactions for millions of births. And here somebody may be chanting, collectively with a large group, for a particular purpose, yet he defines it as useless chanting. It makes me think of a verse in the Srimad Bhagavatam, in the 3rd Canto, spoken by Devahuti. She says that anyone whose work does not lead to religious life and any one whose religious, ritualistic performances do not elevate one to renunciation and anyone who is situated in renunciation that doesn’t lead to devotional service to the Supreme Lord, is to be considered to be a dead body, although breathing.</p>\n<p>\tHere, in this verse, emphasis is given on the ultimate goal. Unless the ultimate goal is reached, which is the essence of today’s verse, if we want to actually achieve the ultimate goal of chanting, we have to become free from offenses. And unless the ultimate goal is achieved, which is devotional service to the Supreme Lord, any other achievement is useless. Because the only full achievement of chanting the Holy Name of the Lord, is to achieve love for the Supreme Lord. Love which is freed from all material desires.</p>\n<p>\tanyabhilasita-sunyam<br />\n\tjnana-karmady-anavrtam\n</p>\n<p>\n\tas Srila Rupa Goswami explains, that such devotional service should be freed from the influence of karma and jnana. And Srila Rupa Goswami also states that</p>\n<p>\tbhukti-mukti-spṛha yavat<br />\n\tpisaci hṛdi vartate\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe says as long as the desire for bhukti, the desire for material enjoyment, mukti, the desire for relief from suffering, liberation, as long as these two desires that are within the heart, which are considered to be like two witches, which haunt one like a ghost, then one will never be able to taste the bliss of devotional service to the Supreme Lord. And therefore it is stated in Caitanya Caritamrita that the goal of chanting is to achieve this love. And Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur here also states that to approach the Lord for something for ourselves, he says it’s an offense. We should not ask anything for ourselves. He says, therefore all these other purposes for which one chants are considered to be useless, unless we actually, purposely, with intent sit and intensely very much pray for service to the Lord. That service, that opportunity to engage in devotional service, is bestowed by the mercy of the Lord and also bestowed by the mercy of the devotee of the Lord. Therefore, in examining these statements, both here in this commentary by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta and here in Srila Prabhupadas commentary, he gives the siddha pranali, which is, that if one wants to be successful in chanting, he quotes the verse that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur emphasizes is the siddha pranali for Gaudiya Vaishnavas which is</p>\n<p>\ttṛṇad api su-nacena taror iva sahiṣṇuna<br />\n\tamanina mana-dena kirtaniyaḥ sada hariḥ\n</p>\n<p>\n\tand Lord Caitanya Himself, has stated when explaining this verse. He says that a devotee who is engaged in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord, he does not retaliate, even if he is rebuked or chastised. He never retaliates or says anything to anyone else about such activity. He says, and he gives an example that, even if a tree is cut, the tree will not complain and even if the tree is drying up, it will not ask anyone for water. And He says that such forbearance must be practiced by the devotee. Thus a Vaishnava should engage in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord and he should never ask anyone for anything for himself. If someone offers, He will accept, but if someone doesn’t offer, he is satisfied to accept whatever comes by its own means. But then He says something very very important. He says, this type of devotional service solidly maintains, this type of behavior solidly maintains a devotees devotional service. This type of behavior. He doesn’t ask, he tolerates. So forbearing! There is a verse in the Srimad Bhagavatam,\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttiraskṛta vipralabdhaḥ<br />\n\tsaptaḥ kṣipta hata api<br />\n\tnasya tat pratikurvanti<br />\n\ttad-bhaktaḥ prabhavo 'pi hi\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis verse is spoken about Parikshit Maharaja. It was spoken by Samika rishi, when he learnt that his son had garlanded a snake around Parikshit Maharajas neck. He was extremely disturbed, because he understood that Parikshit Maharaja, is such a saintly Vaishnava. In his heart he was thinking, if only Parikshit Maharaja would counteract what has happened to him by cursing my son, then that will be proper just punishment for him. But then he realised, wait a minute:</p>\n<p>\ttiraskṛta vipralabdhaḥ<br />\n\tsaptaḥ kṣipta hata api\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHow will it be possible? Parikshit Maharaja wouldn’t do that. Because, devotees of the Lord are so forbearing, that even if they are cheated, cursed, neglected, disturbed, insulted or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves. What can I do? Parikshit Maharaja will never counter curse. I can only simply pray to the Lord, that somehow He sees the situation and He understands what needs to be done to correct the situation, because Parikshit Maharaja will never counteract or counter curse my son. Such is the characteristic of a devotee. A devotee is so forbearing. Cheated, cursed, neglected, insulted, insulted, disturbed or even killed!  But will never avenge himself. Why? Why? Because he is so forbearing, he is so tolerant! This type of devotional service, this type of mood in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord as Lord Caitanya Himself states, this behavior solidly maintains devotional service for the devotee. It gives him the means by which he can actually be situated in devotional service, because he is so tolerant that the Lord cannot neglect! Others may neglect, but the Lord will not neglect.  How can the Lord neglect such a devotee? He cannot neglect. He cannot turn away. Look what happened to Ambarish Maharaja?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Ambarish Maharaja was cursed, he didn’t even pray to the Lord for protection but the Lord protected him. And when Durvasa Muni came to the Lord, first he went to Lord Brahma, he went to Lord Shiva, then he went to Lord Vishnu. Of course Brahma and Shiva they were not able to provide him relief, because that’s what he wanted, he wanted relief.  Please relieve me.  Brahma says I can’t, Lord Shiva says I can’t and then he came to Lord Vishnu, he says, “Please look at me I am suffering”.  Then Lord Vishnu says, “Sorry, I can’t do anything to help you”.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur in his commentaries to these verses, he explains the mood the Lord has in His conversation with Durvasa Muni.  When Durvasa Muni, he approaches the Lord for protection and he says, “Please can you mitigate my distress? You have invoked this chakra, certainly you can remove it”.   The Lord says, “I am sorry, I am not independent. I am completely under the control of my devotee. The devotee is always in My heart and I am always in the heart of My devotee. The devotee doesn’t think of anyone but Me and I don’t think of anyone but him”.  And then what does Durvasa Muni say? He says: “Certainly, when You see somebody suffering and they are coming to You for protection, certainly you must be inclined to feel for his suffering”.  He’s begging, “Please have a heart and the Lord says, “Sorry! Actually I can’t even think of your suffering.  I don’t have a heart and I can’t even think of your suffering”. Durvasa Muni says, “How is it possible?” And then the Lord explains, He says: “My devotee is so dear to Me. He is my devotee because He always takes me into the core of his heart and he is always praying to Me please let me engage in Your service. He doesn’t want anything else. He’s always thinking how he can serve Me. So therefore I approach My devotee and I say, please let Me give you something. But My devotee says, ‘I don’t want anything”. And the Lord says, “I want to give you something, anything”.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tJust like He told Kholaveca Sridhar, he was always chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. People would complain. He said, “Kholaveca, I’ll make you a king.  I’ll give you a kingdom”. Kholaveca says: “No!  You simply be my Lord and master and let me be Your servant birth after birth”. So the Lord explains, He says, “My devotee only asks for one thing, let me serve You! So therefore, how can I give him anything, he doesn’t want? But still I must give him something. I must give him something which is valuable. Something which he’ll appreciate or value. Something that will mean something for him. He doesn’t want wealth. He doesn’t want follower. He doesn’t want beautiful women. He doesn’t want anything from me. But let me give him something that he’ll accept. So what do I give him.  I give him My heart. My devotee has my heart. And you are asking me have a heart! And I am saying, I am sorry. I don’t have one. I can’t even think. My devotee has My mind, he has My heart. You want My heart, You have to go to him”.</p>\n<p>\tThe Lord is so much inclined, He can’t neglect a devotee who is always fully depending upon Him. And therefore, when a devotee chants the Holy Name of the Lord in this mentality. It nourishes, it sustains, solidly maintains a devotees devotional service, so much so, that the Lord gives him the greatest benediction. Not only gives His heart, gives Himself, but He gives His devotee His devotional service, which is the means for perfection.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf one sits and meditates and chants the Holy Names of the Lord, yes, we may want to go back home back to godhead, we want to actually take shelter in the spiritual world, but actually that place can be obtained only by those who think first and foremost, service. It’s not achieved by anything else. Only if one actually has this attitude, this complete helpless dependence, ‘Oh Lord please engage me in Your service’.  Therefore we must understand that this devotional service to enter into the spiritual world can only be achieved when one actually gets the mercy of the Lord's devotee.  And therefore, it is stated by Srila Narattoma Das Thakur, he says that “When will Lord Nityananda's mercy be fully manifest to me, so that material desires will become so completely insignificant, when will that time come?” And he says, “When my mind is completely purified, completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires, then and only then, will I be able to understand Sri Vrindavan dham and the conjugal love of Sri Radha and Krishna and only then will my spiritual life be successful”.  </p>\n<p>\tHe explains that, “Yes, I have to get the mercy of the greatest servant of Lord Caitanya who is Lord Nityananda. It is Lord Nityananda who actually cleanses the heart. Gives one spiritual strength. Gives one the strength to actually become free from all these material obstacles, the desire for wealth, the desire for relief from suffering, the desire for material enjoyment”. In the Srimad Bhagavatam it is stated by Narada Muni, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to those devotees who have no material possessions and who are fully satisfied in possessing only devotional service to the Supreme Lord.  Indeed the Lord relishes the activities of such devotees. Those who are puffed up by respectable parentage, by great opulence, by bodily beauty, they’re generally proud of possessing such things. And even if they offer the Lord worship, he says the Lord is not inclined to accept it. Why? Because they deride the devotee of the Lord. When they see the devotee, who is so fully dependent upon the mercy of the Lord, they deride the devotee. Just like Kholaveca Sridhar, the worshipers of goddess Chandi, they saw how Kholaveca Sridhar was so absorbed in chanting, but they would deride him. ‘Why don’t you worship goddess Chandi? Look at us we are wealthy, and look at you, you live in a hut, your roof, there are so many holes in it. You are crying at night, all night long with hunger pains, disturbing all your neighbors. Why don’t you take shelter?’  But what was Kholaveca Sridhar’s mood?  His mood was completely calling out the Names of the Lord. Only for one purpose, only for one purpose, to glorify the Lord, to be engaged in the service of the Lord. Such devotional service, such behavior, solidly maintains a devotees devotional service.</p>\n<p>\tLord Nityananda is very merciful and therefore as we understand, if we want to enter into the dancing party of Radha and Krsna we have to catch hold of the feet of Lord Nityananda and only then will we be qualified to enter into the spiritual world.  It is Lord Nityananda who showed by His example, how to take the order of the Supreme Lord and to tolerate all kinds of inconveniences. It was Lord Nityananda who took the order of Lord Caitanya, who told Him go out every day into the streets, and then induce others to chant Krsna's names, to tell others about Krsna, make Krsna your life and then you come back in the evening and you tell me how many people have been chanting?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is Lord Nityananda begging for? He was begging to give others the opportunity to understand what is the real meaning of the Holy Name of the Lord and therefore His method of distribution was so glorious, so glorious that by His method of distribution He will awaken faith in others. This is what He was looking for; He was not looking for anything else.</p>\n<p>\tSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakur says that when patrolman Haridas Thakur and Lord Nityananda went into the streets, They did not go out for any selfish purpose, begging for milk and rice. They simply went out for one reason, carrying the order of the Lord on their heads and begging everyone, even in the face of all kinds of adversities. Being struck in the head with a pot by Madhai, still He was so merciful. So merciful.</p>\n<p>\tHe was thinking that “Yes, if I can make these two personalities understand Lord Caitanya, then I will be recognized as Lord Caitanyas servant”. So it is Lord Nityananda, and the servant of Lord Nityananda who gives us the opportunity to engage in service and not only in chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, but to cleanse the heart, to purify the heart from all material anxieties and desires, so that one can be qualified to enter into Sri Vrindavan Dham. Then we’ll be able to enter into the dancing party of Radha and Krishna.  Then we’ll actually be able to approach Radha and Krishna by catching tightly, firmly holding the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda. This way we understand that we have gathered here to chant, collectively, we are chanting, praying for the opportunity to serve. That is our shelter! That is our means for perfection. That is our means for actually pleasing the Lord and becoming qualified to enter into the spiritual world and to enter that transcendental abode and thereby become qualified.</p>\n<p>\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta actually explains in the harmonist magazine, he explains something very important. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur says that when Lord Nityananda especially favors a devotee and when He deems His devotee fit for rendering service to Srimati Radhika, He offers that devotee for Her service. Srimati Radharani is the Guru of the inner circle and Lord Nityananda, He is the Guru for the masses. It is Lord Nityananda who actually goes out to the masses and by His method of distribution awakens faith in devotional service, pure devotional service. Not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord for relief of distress, not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord to become free from epidemics, not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord for elevation to the heavenly planets. By chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, His meditation was only one thing only, His meditation was service to Lord Caitanya. He did not even go out and distribute until He received the order from Lord Caitanya although He traveled on pilgrimage for 20 years, He waited until He came here, to the house of Nandan Acharya and then when He came here and received the order, then He took it up. It is the order!  That is our method of service to the Holy Name. And Srila Prabhupada explains that in today’s purport. Very important and I’ll end with this because I see a sign here that says very important, class must end by 8:45am.</p>\n<p>\tPrabhupada says, “Thus one is understood to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he considers himself an eternal servant of the Holy Name and in this spirit distributes the Holy Name to the world. One who chants in that spirit, without offenses”. Without offenses, as we said today, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur said any other purpose for chanting, other than for service is offensive, because it is asking something for myself. So he says, “One who chants in that spirit, without offenses, is certainly elevated to the platform of understanding that the Holy Name and the Personality of Godhead are identical. To associate with the Holy Name and chant the Holy Name is to associate with the Personality of Godhead directly”.</p>\n<p>\tkali-kale naam-rupe krishna-avatara<br />\n\tnama haite haya sarva-jagat-nistara\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is stated in the Caitanya Caritamrita that in the age of the kali the Supreme Lord appears in the form of His Holy Name. Anyone who associates with the Holy Name is as good as associating with the Lord directly and certainly he is delivered.<br />\n\t \n</p>\n<p>\n\tI have to end here. Thank you very much for your kind attention.</p>\n<p>\tHare Krsna!</p>\n<p>\tApplause!\n</p>\n",

When he was being whipped in 22 market places and Lord Caitanya sent the sudarshan chakra to chop the heads off the accusers, Haridas Thakur prayed “Please forgive them.&nbsp; They do not know what they do.”&nbsp; As a result Lord Caitanya took the hits of the whip on his own back.&nbsp; He later showed Haridas Thakur his back which was scarred by the whip and Haridas Thakur fainted.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThroughout ISKCON, every centre and leader can establish this culture of care.&nbsp; We don’t expect every centre to have the other facilities like hospices etc.&nbsp; We are discussing how every continent can have facilities.&nbsp; Tirupati being a holy place, a Vaikuntha on earth, Revati Raman has some plans to build an elderly citizens asrama.&nbsp; I think that HH Bhaktitirtha Swami, his idea of leaving his body in Gita Nagari was to show that these temples in the West are holy places.&nbsp; That will be an ideal place to establish some facility there.&nbsp; It is being discussed by local devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore each continent and country, depending on the size, can have some facility for devotees like hospices, asramas for elderly devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn India there are websites for devotees get married.&nbsp; All these things are different categories of devotee care.&nbsp; In Mayapur, the hospital has two dental chairs.&nbsp; For a root canal they charge 1500 rupees.&nbsp; In America they charge something outrageous in the thousands.&nbsp; So you can come to the festival free and get your tooth done.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat way you can save money!&nbsp; &lt;laughter&gt;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBig countries like Brazil have many farms so they could have some facilities there.&nbsp; There are many farms in the USA.&nbsp; Some of these farms were visited by Srila Prabhupada.&nbsp; How rare!&nbsp; It is said that three miles around these places are considered to be a dham.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tQuestion for HH RNS: Jayapataka Swami spoke this morning about a culture of care and we know that it cannot exist without love and trust.&nbsp; RNS embodies this love and trust.&nbsp; Please share how we can remember that this is who we are?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRNS:&nbsp; Vraja lila sees everyone as a mirror of her own spiritual qualities.&nbsp; On the material platform a baby trusts his mother because of the mother’s unconditional care.&nbsp; Our ability to serve Krsna is rooted in Srila Prabhupada’s love for us as it has come thru his life and teachings.&nbsp; That love and our trust in that love empowered us to push forward this movement.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe may not have love but Srila Prabhupada opened the doors for us to strive for that unconditional love.&nbsp; In doing so, he gave us the opportunity to engage in the 9 processes of devotional service thru our sadhana, character and thru our service we could realize that love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is our responsibility to be divine caretakers of his devotees thru authentically representing him thru our words and actions.&nbsp; As leaders of devotional communities you can organize facilities, systems and programs to inspire and empower our devotees to be happy in Krsna Consciousness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBhaktivinoda Thakur said that the essence of dharma is to taste the sweetness of hari katha, serve the vaisnavas.&nbsp; That is what it means to be instruments of Srila Prabhupada’s compassion – always, everywhere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevotee care in this sense is very foundational.&nbsp; When we prioritize the hearts of each devotee and inspiring those hearts for the desire of pure devotional service, then we will truly have a culture of love and trust.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tQuestion for HH KVS:&nbsp; Isn’t all this stuff about devotee care sentimental when everything is for Krsna?&nbsp; Shouldn’t the focus just be on reading, following sadhana etc?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKVS: There is kanistha, madhyama and uttama adhikari.&nbsp; We heard this morning that Krsna loves to take care of his devotees so if we don’t follow in his footsteps then we can’t be with Krsna.&nbsp; If we are chanting and reading properly, then we would naturally want others to do that.&nbsp; We all need help to follow the program.&nbsp; Charity begins at home.&nbsp; It’s not sentimental in the mundane sense.&nbsp; We need help to take care of ourselves.&nbsp; In order to practice, we need to take care of devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tQuestion for all panelists:&nbsp; When temples are small its easier to provide devotee care.&nbsp; How can we maintain care when temples grow bigger?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRNS:&nbsp; If we as leaders really care, if we appreciate how Krsna and Srila Prabhupada really care, then whether we are big or small we will find the way to create the systems for devotee care.&nbsp; Srila Prabhupada would say impossible is a word in a fools dictionary.&nbsp; Nothing is impossible if we have the desire.&nbsp; It may be impossible for you and me, but it’s not impossible for Krsna.&nbsp; When we really care about others’ spiritual lives and every aspect of their life that is important for the sustainability of their spiritual life, then Krsna personally thru our parampara empowers us.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo really be an instrument and deeply transform people’s hearts, we need to really care about people.&nbsp; That’s what Srila Prabhupada taught us.&nbsp; If we do, then beyond all of our limitations, Krsna will definitely empower us to do great things.&nbsp; Purity is the force.&nbsp; Srila Prabhupda wanted us to make the whole world Krsna Consciousness.&nbsp; That’s more than just a lot of devotees in a temple.&nbsp; Srila Prabhupada taught that if we just surrender with humility and compassion, \"We could actually make the whole world Krsna conscious in 18 days.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJPS:&nbsp; I was thinking about why this person thought a small temple was better at devotee care.&nbsp; It must be because the leader of his temple was giving care nicely and when the temple grew larger he couldn’t cover everyone.&nbsp; In order to be successful he would have to empower others and see that many are giving care.&nbsp; Ideally, as Radhanath Swami said everyone should take on responsibility for giving care.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe aspect of giving care as we mentioned earlier is that we want to establish a culture of devotee care.&nbsp; I remember when we started in Mayapur we had 5 devotees and now we have 5000.&nbsp; It’s certainly beyond me to keep track of all devotes.&nbsp; That’s why I’m always spending my time encouraging other leaders to be sensitive and care giving.&nbsp; This is the challenge in ISKCON of appreciating each devotees.&nbsp; We hear about this in the 3rd verse of Siksastakam – amanina manadena – don’t expect respect for yourself but give appreciation to all others.&nbsp; If that can be followed, then we would have no problems.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS:&nbsp; I discussed this in the very beginning of “Taking Care of Krsna’s Devotees” when I was nourished in a small temple and being cared for by my temple president who would tell me something about Srila Prabhupada.&nbsp; That type of care can easily be lost when the temple grows if the leader changes his priorities.&nbsp; As Jayapataka Swami just said and I would just have to repeat, the priority should always be consistent.&nbsp; If you are caring for a few devotees in a small group then the natural result of being cared for is wanting to reciprocate.&nbsp; “Let me offer something in return to that person who cared for me in taking responsibility of caring for others the same way I was cared for.”&nbsp; In this way a temple can grow exponentially.&nbsp; Therefore, if the leaders are responsible for keeping the vision always the same – the primary resource is ALWAYS devotees.&nbsp; Everything else is secondary.&nbsp; Only then the project will naturally grow in a very organic way and these principles will not be lost.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKVS:&nbsp; I was thinking that the mood could be there that bigger is better because you have so many more people who can take care.&nbsp; We see this even in big families that so many people can help you out in day-to-day life.&nbsp; If that mood is there then it is actually more personal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tQuestion For RNS:&nbsp; I have experienced that devotees lose trust in a leader and they are very verbal about it. What would you advise such a devotee to help them trust leaders?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRNS: Trust is a natural expression of the heart.&nbsp; It is not something that can be superimposed upon someone.&nbsp; If one does not have trust in a particular leader, in a Vaisnava culture, unless they are doing something bad, we should respect them.&nbsp; Vaisnava culture is one of respect even if we do not trust someone.&nbsp; We can still respect from a distance, respect seniority.&nbsp; This is something that is really challenging our movement when people say something about anyone at any time.&nbsp; Bhakti cannot flourish in such a setting.&nbsp; For example, even if our parents do not follow the four regulative principles, we should still respect them.&nbsp; If we do not have trust in a particular leader, then we put trust in a leader we can trust.&nbsp; Losing trust in a particular person is not the end of our spiritual life.&nbsp; It’s like an electrical current – if that electrical outlet doesn’t provide that energy we need, then we go to another.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor KVS:&nbsp; How to balance caring and chastising while teaching devotee children and teenagers in Sridham Mayapur?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKVS: Better to be unbalanced and be much more caring.&nbsp; Children or anybody learn by example.&nbsp; So if we are chastising them too much then they will chastise the next person down the line.&nbsp; Of course sometimes we need to correct sometimes but it should be done with love.&nbsp; Attitude is everything.&nbsp; We can feel it when someone is correcting out of love and not out of envy.&nbsp; I remember one Mother told me that she couldn’t control her kids and I said, “We are not supposed to control our children but ourselves, anger and mind.”&nbsp; &lt;laughter&gt;&nbsp; Usually one is chastised when one is angry.&nbsp; If we really care, we should take time and guide them and explain to them the reasons.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tQuestion for NRS: If a devotee feels he needs care what is the proper way to request it?&nbsp; What is the best way to take the first step?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNRS:&nbsp; The best way to request is to submissively reveal his mind to another devotee and the responsibility of the devotee who he is speaking to is to hear him.&nbsp; Sometimes that’s a major endeavor.&nbsp; Our minds go racing to different things that we are already ready to offer an objection or suggestion.&nbsp; But submissive inquiry is the essence.&nbsp; Submission means to quell the mind and hear very carefully the words that are coming from the person we reveal our minds to, deeply praying for guru and Krsna to reveal themselves through their words.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tQuestion for JPS:&nbsp; Srila Prabhupada in his various books, letters etc has given us so much about devotee care.&nbsp; Why was this important aspect not given importance in our movement after Srila Prabhupada’s departure?&nbsp; As a result we’ve lost so many devotees due to a lack of care.&nbsp; At least now this area is being given importance and the GBC should ensure it is being implemented in all temples.&nbsp; Is there a system of devotee care for those sannyasis who are falling?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJPS:&nbsp; I hear two questions and one request.&nbsp; One question is why this wasn’t implemented in the past.&nbsp; The ability to give care is transcendental and in mode of goodness. At the time of Srila Prabhupada’s departure it seemed that the focus was more on expansion. Devotee care got low priority. Now the GBC has taken this on as a major initiative and they made a permanent devotee care committee. Maybe it will get transformed into a ministry later. As far as leaders getting care, especially those going through difficulties, this is an issue that we’ve tried to push that these are Maharatis or Ratis, and somehow they get wounded in battle. When we see the war of Kuruksetra, we see how they received care. The charioteer would drive to the side and arrange for someone to provide medical health. Then when they get better, they felt like ‘Why did you take me out?! Let me fight!’ So we can take inspiration from RNS’s point that Srila Prabhuapda declared war on maya – and she won’t go without a fight! This is 10000 years! Our fight is drums, kartals and Hare Krsna!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna is more powerful than kali. Lord Caitanya and Nitai’s mercy is more powerful than kali. Certainly if we need to have a program for our leaders in case they have some difficulty that they get up and join the fight again because we need them. This is a fight to the finish! And kali will be finished for 10,000 years!\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"safe_value": "<p>\n\tThe following is an edited transcript Vrndavana Vinodini dd rendered from her notes and recordings taken at the Devotee Care panel on February 18th.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t \n</p>\n<p>\n\tPanel presenters: HH Jayapataka Swami (JPS), HH Kavicandra Swami (KVS), HH Niranjana Swami (NRS) and HH Radhanath Swami (RNS)\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFacilitator:  HG Vraja Lila dd\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion for NRS:  Devotee care begins when we feel comfortable and happy to reveal our minds in confidence.  Can you speak more on this?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNRS:  We spoke of the importance of creating a proper atmosphere for devotees to reveal their minds in confidence.  Devotees in senior positions of leadership have a great responsibility to be exemplary.  Being a good example will on its own create trust, but even more than that, it is important to control the urge to speak.  If one doesn’t control the tendency to speak then enmity arises due to speaking about others.  Anyone in a position of leadership, I can tell you, you have to hear a lot about others.  It generally makes its way to you.  Creating a culture of knowing when to speak and what to speak about others - this culture is actually a Vaisnava culture.  We should not speak unnecessarily about others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t So what is necessary and what is unnecessary?  Bhaktivinod Thakur explains that normally when people get together they have a spontaneous inclination to speak about others.  If we don’t have sufficient attraction to speak about Krsna then it can be perverted.  Then that proclivity will erupt into spontaneous talking about other devotees.  In that talk something that is confidential or inaccurate may come out and it will break down trust in Vaisnava relationships.  When trust is broken, then the culture of trust is disrupted in whatever community we live in – locally or globally.  Due to the age we live in now, things can be spread in a moment. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Bhaktivinoda Thakur explains that first one must control themselves and then only can they control the whole world.  Vaco vegam manasa krodha vegam…\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion for JPS:  Jayapataka Swami has a global vision to implement facilities on how to care for devotees.  So many initiatives have been started over the world and especially in Mayapur.  Please elaborate on this vision and how can devotees can take this vision to their places?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJPS:  Of course, I can’t take much credit.  Bhaktivedanta Hospital was created by HH Radhanatha Swami.  We just asked them to make a branch here.  The hospice is still underway.  The GBC effort coordinated by Badrinarayana prabhu is making the facilities for care for devotees who have served ISKCON.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe want first of all for the culture of care to actually be established.  It is the thread in the cloth that makes the cloth stay together.  Haridas Thakur was the best example of how when he was arrested, he started the first prison preaching.  He is our saint for prison preaching.! When he was being whipped in 22 market places and Lord Caitanya sent the sudarshan chakra to chop the heads off the accusers, Haridas Thakur prayed “Please forgive them.  They do not know what they do.”  As a result Lord Caitanya took the hits of the whip on his own back.  He later showed Haridas Thakur his back which was scarred by the whip and Haridas Thakur fainted. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThroughout ISKCON, every centre and leader can establish this culture of care.  We don’t expect every centre to have the other facilities like hospices etc.  We are discussing how every continent can have facilities.  Tirupati being a holy place, a Vaikuntha on earth, Revati Raman has some plans to build an elderly citizens asrama.  I think that HH Bhaktitirtha Swami, his idea of leaving his body in Gita Nagari was to show that these temples in the West are holy places.  That will be an ideal place to establish some facility there.  It is being discussed by local devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore each continent and country, depending on the size, can have some facility for devotees like hospices, asramas for elderly devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn India there are websites for devotees get married.  All these things are different categories of devotee care.  In Mayapur, the hospital has two dental chairs.  For a root canal they charge 1500 rupees.  In America they charge something outrageous in the thousands.  So you can come to the festival free and get your tooth done.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat way you can save money!  &lt;laughter&gt;\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBig countries like Brazil have many farms so they could have some facilities there.  There are many farms in the USA.  Some of these farms were visited by Srila Prabhupada.  How rare!  It is said that three miles around these places are considered to be a dham.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion for HH RNS: Jayapataka Swami spoke this morning about a culture of care and we know that it cannot exist without love and trust.  RNS embodies this love and trust.  Please share how we can remember that this is who we are?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRNS:  Vraja lila sees everyone as a mirror of her own spiritual qualities.  On the material platform a baby trusts his mother because of the mother’s unconditional care.  Our ability to serve Krsna is rooted in Srila Prabhupada’s love for us as it has come thru his life and teachings.  That love and our trust in that love empowered us to push forward this movement. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe may not have love but Srila Prabhupada opened the doors for us to strive for that unconditional love.  In doing so, he gave us the opportunity to engage in the 9 processes of devotional service thru our sadhana, character and thru our service we could realize that love.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is our responsibility to be divine caretakers of his devotees thru authentically representing him thru our words and actions.  As leaders of devotional communities you can organize facilities, systems and programs to inspire and empower our devotees to be happy in Krsna Consciousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBhaktivinoda Thakur said that the essence of dharma is to taste the sweetness of hari katha, serve the vaisnavas.  That is what it means to be instruments of Srila Prabhupada’s compassion – always, everywhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDevotee care in this sense is very foundational.  When we prioritize the hearts of each devotee and inspiring those hearts for the desire of pure devotional service, then we will truly have a culture of love and trust.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion for HH KVS:  Isn’t all this stuff about devotee care sentimental when everything is for Krsna?  Shouldn’t the focus just be on reading, following sadhana etc?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKVS: There is kanistha, madhyama and uttama adhikari.  We heard this morning that Krsna loves to take care of his devotees so if we don’t follow in his footsteps then we can’t be with Krsna.  If we are chanting and reading properly, then we would naturally want others to do that.  We all need help to follow the program.  Charity begins at home.  It’s not sentimental in the mundane sense.  We need help to take care of ourselves.  In order to practice, we need to take care of devotees.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion for all panelists:  When temples are small its easier to provide devotee care.  How can we maintain care when temples grow bigger?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRNS:  If we as leaders really care, if we appreciate how Krsna and Srila Prabhupada really care, then whether we are big or small we will find the way to create the systems for devotee care.  Srila Prabhupada would say impossible is a word in a fools dictionary.  Nothing is impossible if we have the desire.  It may be impossible for you and me, but it’s not impossible for Krsna.  When we really care about others’ spiritual lives and every aspect of their life that is important for the sustainability of their spiritual life, then Krsna personally thru our parampara empowers us. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo really be an instrument and deeply transform people’s hearts, we need to really care about people.  That’s what Srila Prabhupada taught us.  If we do, then beyond all of our limitations, Krsna will definitely empower us to do great things.  Purity is the force.  Srila Prabhupda wanted us to make the whole world Krsna Consciousness.  That’s more than just a lot of devotees in a temple.  Srila Prabhupada taught that if we just surrender with humility and compassion, \"We could actually make the whole world Krsna conscious in 18 days.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJPS:  I was thinking about why this person thought a small temple was better at devotee care.  It must be because the leader of his temple was giving care nicely and when the temple grew larger he couldn’t cover everyone.  In order to be successful he would have to empower others and see that many are giving care.  Ideally, as Radhanath Swami said everyone should take on responsibility for giving care.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe aspect of giving care as we mentioned earlier is that we want to establish a culture of devotee care.  I remember when we started in Mayapur we had 5 devotees and now we have 5000.  It’s certainly beyond me to keep track of all devotes.  That’s why I’m always spending my time encouraging other leaders to be sensitive and care giving.  This is the challenge in ISKCON of appreciating each devotees.  We hear about this in the 3rd verse of Siksastakam – amanina manadena – don’t expect respect for yourself but give appreciation to all others.  If that can be followed, then we would have no problems.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNRS:  I discussed this in the very beginning of “Taking Care of Krsna’s Devotees” when I was nourished in a small temple and being cared for by my temple president who would tell me something about Srila Prabhupada.  That type of care can easily be lost when the temple grows if the leader changes his priorities.  As Jayapataka Swami just said and I would just have to repeat, the priority should always be consistent.  If you are caring for a few devotees in a small group then the natural result of being cared for is wanting to reciprocate.  “Let me offer something in return to that person who cared for me in taking responsibility of caring for others the same way I was cared for.”  In this way a temple can grow exponentially.  Therefore, if the leaders are responsible for keeping the vision always the same – the primary resource is ALWAYS devotees.  Everything else is secondary.  Only then the project will naturally grow in a very organic way and these principles will not be lost.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKVS:  I was thinking that the mood could be there that bigger is better because you have so many more people who can take care.  We see this even in big families that so many people can help you out in day-to-day life.  If that mood is there then it is actually more personal.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion For RNS:  I have experienced that devotees lose trust in a leader and they are very verbal about it. What would you advise such a devotee to help them trust leaders?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRNS: Trust is a natural expression of the heart.  It is not something that can be superimposed upon someone.  If one does not have trust in a particular leader, in a Vaisnava culture, unless they are doing something bad, we should respect them.  Vaisnava culture is one of respect even if we do not trust someone.  We can still respect from a distance, respect seniority.  This is something that is really challenging our movement when people say something about anyone at any time.  Bhakti cannot flourish in such a setting.  For example, even if our parents do not follow the four regulative principles, we should still respect them.  If we do not have trust in a particular leader, then we put trust in a leader we can trust.  Losing trust in a particular person is not the end of our spiritual life.  It’s like an electrical current – if that electrical outlet doesn’t provide that energy we need, then we go to another.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor KVS:  How to balance caring and chastising while teaching devotee children and teenagers in Sridham Mayapur?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKVS: Better to be unbalanced and be much more caring.  Children or anybody learn by example.  So if we are chastising them too much then they will chastise the next person down the line.  Of course sometimes we need to correct sometimes but it should be done with love.  Attitude is everything.  We can feel it when someone is correcting out of love and not out of envy.  I remember one Mother told me that she couldn’t control her kids and I said, “We are not supposed to control our children but ourselves, anger and mind.”  &lt;laughter&gt;  Usually one is chastised when one is angry.  If we really care, we should take time and guide them and explain to them the reasons.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion for NRS: If a devotee feels he needs care what is the proper way to request it?  What is the best way to take the first step?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNRS:  The best way to request is to submissively reveal his mind to another devotee and the responsibility of the devotee who he is speaking to is to hear him.  Sometimes that’s a major endeavor.  Our minds go racing to different things that we are already ready to offer an objection or suggestion.  But submissive inquiry is the essence.  Submission means to quell the mind and hear very carefully the words that are coming from the person we reveal our minds to, deeply praying for guru and Krsna to reveal themselves through their words.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion for JPS:  Srila Prabhupada in his various books, letters etc has given us so much about devotee care.  Why was this important aspect not given importance in our movement after Srila Prabhupada’s departure?  As a result we’ve lost so many devotees due to a lack of care.  At least now this area is being given importance and the GBC should ensure it is being implemented in all temples.  Is there a system of devotee care for those sannyasis who are falling?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJPS:  I hear two questions and one request.  One question is why this wasn’t implemented in the past.  The ability to give care is transcendental and in mode of goodness. At the time of Srila Prabhupada’s departure it seemed that the focus was more on expansion. Devotee care got low priority. Now the GBC has taken this on as a major initiative and they made a permanent devotee care committee. Maybe it will get transformed into a ministry later.

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tI arrived in Mumbai very early on the morning of February 6th. Having flown all night from Istanbul, I was tired and therefore had to rest a good part of the day on February 6th. Nonetheless, I was able to spend a good part of the afternoon with Radhanath Maharaja. We spent quite some time talking about many topics, as we usually do, and then we planned the next several days that I would be here in Chowpatty.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn February 8th and 9th there was a Kirtan Mela here in Mumbai, organized by one recently-married devotee who had previously lived in the Chowpatty brahmacari asrama. A large hall was rented, and various kirtaniyas were invited to participate in the event. Having learned that I was in Chowpatty, I was also requested to take part. So I spent some of the time on those two days with Radhanath Maharaja and the rest of the time I spent at the Kirtan Mela.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn February 9th, Radhanath Maharaja gave SB class in the morning, and I was asked to give the Sunday Feast lecture, accompanied by three other disciples of Srila Prabhupada. I was asked to speak first, so I tried my best to set the tone of the program around Srila Prabhupada, thus encouraging my godbrother and two godsisters, all of whom had personal association with Srila Prabhupada, to share their realizations of his glories. It turned out to be a wonderful program, which seemed to be very inspiring for all who participated, including myself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter the Sunday program we all took lunch together, and then we were invited to Krsnacandra Prabhu's home for more association with each other in the evening. We all shared more stories about Srila Prabhupada, about Yamuna dd (since both godsisters were very close to her), and also some stories of the early days in New Vrndavana, since also present was my godbrother, Kuladri Prabhu, who was the Temple President of New Vrndavana for so many years. He was also Radhanath Maharaja's Temple President during the time when Maharaja was a brahmacari in New Vrndavana. Both of them had quite a few stories to share about the early days of New Vrndavana.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEarly this morning, I left Chowpatty to Govardhana Eco-Village, the Chowpatty farm project about 100 kilometers outside of Mumbai. Kuladri Prabhu and I were invited to take part in the inauguration of the \"Yamuna Project.\" The Yamuna Project will be a replica of the Yamuna River, which will be established right there in the Govardhana Eco-Village.

Having flown all night from Istanbul, I was tired and therefore had to rest a good part of the day on February 6th. Nonetheless, I was able to spend a good part of the afternoon with Radhanath Maharaja. We spent quite some time talking about many topics, as we usually do, and then we planned the next several days that I would be here in Chowpatty.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn February 8th and 9th there was a Kirtan Mela here in Mumbai, organized by one recently-married devotee who had previously lived in the Chowpatty brahmacari asrama. A large hall was rented, and various kirtaniyas were invited to participate in the event. Having learned that I was in Chowpatty, I was also requested to take part. So I spent some of the time on those two days with Radhanath Maharaja and the rest of the time I spent at the Kirtan Mela.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn February 9th, Radhanath Maharaja gave SB class in the morning, and I was asked to give the Sunday Feast lecture, accompanied by three other disciples of Srila Prabhupada. I was asked to speak first, so I tried my best to set the tone of the program around Srila Prabhupada, thus encouraging my godbrother and two godsisters, all of whom had personal association with Srila Prabhupada, to share their realizations of his glories. It turned out to be a wonderful program, which seemed to be very inspiring for all who participated, including myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the Sunday program we all took lunch together, and then we were invited to Krsnacandra Prabhu's home for more association with each other in the evening. We all shared more stories about Srila Prabhupada, about Yamuna dd (since both godsisters were very close to her), and also some stories of the early days in New Vrndavana, since also present was my godbrother, Kuladri Prabhu, who was the Temple President of New Vrndavana for so many years. He was also Radhanath Maharaja's Temple President during the time when Maharaja was a brahmacari in New Vrndavana. Both of them had quite a few stories to share about the early days of New Vrndavana.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEarly this morning, I left Chowpatty to Govardhana Eco-Village, the Chowpatty farm project about 100 kilometers outside of Mumbai. Kuladri Prabhu and I were invited to take part in the inauguration of the \"Yamuna Project.\" The Yamuna Project will be a replica of the Yamuna River, which will be established right there in the Govardhana Eco-Village. Along with the Yamuna River will also be Govardhana, all the forests of Vrndavana, and also seven main temples of Vrndavana, something very similar to that which was envisioned by Srila Prabhupada for the New Vrndavana project in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter a two-hour drive from Mumbai, Kuladri Prabhu and I arrived at approximately 8:00 AM.

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tDevotees may be wondering why there's been such a long lapse since my last blog. Between Taiwan, Almaty, Kiev, and then my flight to the United States, I was not able to find the right opportunity to write. After arriving in the United States, I then flew to Florida to spend time with my godbrother, Guru Gauranga Prabhu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'm currently staying in the East Hartford temple and for the most part, I plan to remain here until the end of the year.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'm always hesitant to write about my health. However, since I often need to explain why I must cancel travel plans or why I cannot accept invitations to visit so many places, the health factor, more often than not, appears in my explanations. Hence, I've decided that I must once again write something about my health.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I was in Almaty, I had to go through another series of tests in order to ascertain the current condition of my gastrointestinal tract organs. The gastroenterologist was pleased to report that the most serious area of concern, which he had noted from my previous tests done in August, showed significant signs of improvement. He attributed the improvements to the medication he put me on back in August.

We decided to travel a short distance outside Navadvipa Mandala to Ambika Kalna where the temple of Gauridas Pandita is situated. It was a bit of a drive, especially since the road is not always so smooth, but based on my experience of the previous four days, I knew it would be well worth the time and inconvenience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately, Dhanurdhara Maharaja had to return to Vrndavana the evening before. His presence was so much appreciated by all of us for many reasons, but especially because he was so easy to be satisfied. He was visibly enlivened by everything we did on parikrama—to hear, to read, and especially to chant bhajans. He must have told me at least four times that it was the best parikrama he had ever been on—and he's been on a lot of parikramas! Of course, it's possible he might have been saying that just to encourage me. But judging from his facial expression, I sensed that he was serious.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is a wonderful story from Bhakti Ratnakara connected to the temple in Ambika Kalna. I was very eager to take darshan of the Gaura Nitai Deities Who had once left the altar to take part in the kirtan organized by Gauridas Pandita's disciple, Hrdaya Caitanya.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe following is the story exactly as it was told by Narahari Cakravarty in Bhakti Ratnakara, Chapter Seven, and translated by Kusakratha Prabhu:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne day he [Gauridas Pandita] told Hrdaya Nanda that the Lord's birthday was approaching.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"I shall visit the houses of my followers to collect provisions for the festvial and I shall return soon,\" said Gauridasa.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Be very careful in your service to the Lord.\"&nbsp; Then Gauridasa left his house.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGauridasa passed some time in solitary places with other devotees singing about the glories of the Lord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile Hrdaya Nanda began to think, \"Why is the master so late in returning?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Only two more days remain before the ceremony and enough provisions have already been collected here.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tConsidering these points and remembering the feet of his spiritual master he decided to send invitations everywhere for the great ocassion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPandita Gauridasa returned just one day before the festival and when he heard that Hrdaya had sent invitations everywhere, even without his permission, Gauridasa felt happy right to the core of his heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOutwardly, however he showed his displeasure and scolded Hrdaya angrily.&nbsp; \"While I am still living you have acted in an independent manner.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"You have sent invitation letters at your own will but I shall not join you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHrdaya bowed at his master's feet and went to the bank of the Ganges where he lived under a tree.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGauridasa started the festival and mahantas from far and near assembled there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne wealthy man sent a large quantity of provisions in a boat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe rich man met Sri Hrdaya Nanda on the bank of the Ganges and handed the provisions to him.&nbsp; Hrdaya Pandita sent a message to Pandita Gauridasa.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn mock anger the Pandita told the messenger to tell Hrdaya Nanda that he could use the provisions for his own celebration.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn the order of his guru Sri Hrdaya happily began to celebrate the occasion using those provisions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA large number of Vaisnavas assembled there and in their association Hrdaya Nanda performed wonderful sankirtana.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs the sound of the khola and kartala reached the sky it seemed that the ocean of happiness would overflow its banks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVaisnavas danced in a circle, with tears flowing continously down their faces.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuddenly Hrdaya observed that both Lord Nitai and Lord Caitanya - the incarnations of love - were dancing within the circle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe style of their dancing was indescribable and their physical beauty brightened the whole world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe faces of those two Lords defeated the pride of the moon and Hrdaya Nanda cried in joy as he observed them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHearing the joyous sound of that sankirtana Gauridasa became very pleased although he remained in his own place.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe gently told Gangadasa, \"It is now time to worship.&nbsp; Go to the temple.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut when Hara Gangadasa entered the temple he found no deities on the throne.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen he reported this to the Pandita, Gauridasa was overwhelmed in ecstasy as he realised that the two Lords had been bound in love of Hrdaya Nanda.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith a smile he took his stick in his hand and although he was happy to the core of his heart, he displayed outward anger and headed for that sankirtana gathering by the side of the Ganga.&nbsp; There he saw his two Lords dancing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tObserving the mock anger of the Pandita the two Prabhus clandestinely entered the temple again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGauridasa witnessed that Sri Caitanya had entered into the heart of Hrdaya Nanda.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeeing Caitanya present in the heart of Hrdaya Nanda Gauridasa could not control his tears.&nbsp; He looked continually with unblinking eyes.&nbsp; He forgot his mock anger and unconsciously the stick fell from his hand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStretching out his arms in ecstatic love he went forward to embrace Hrdaya.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"How fortunate you are,\" said Gauridasa. \"From this day I name you Hrdaya Caitanya - the man in whose heart Sri Caitanya always resides.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe drenched Hrdaya with his tears and the disciple fell at the feet of his master.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTogether they returned to the temple.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAcknowledging the special effulgence of the Lord, Gauridasa appointed Hrdaya Caitanya to the total service of the deities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Vaisnavas were all happy about this and the great festival they held defies description.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe grace of the Lord on Hrdaya became known to all. This is the story about Hrdaya Nanda's obtaining the name Hrdaya Caitanya.\" [end of reference]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we arrived, we first took darshan of the tamarind tree where it is said that Lord Caitanya and Gauridasa Pandita once met. From there we entered the temple. Some local devotees were having kirtan. Not wanting to interfere with their mood, we set aside our kirtan paraphernalia and instead immediately went to take darshan of the Deities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs soon as the pujari saw us enter the temple room, he motioned for us to come up the stairs on to the front of the altar so that we could have close darshan of all the Deities. At his request, we first washed our feet and then he invited us up right in front of the altar.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy the time we arrived at the altar of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai, unexpectedly, the pujari had closed the Deity doors. Not knowing how long the doors would be closed, Devamrita Maharaja and I went back to the doors of the first altar in order to attempt seeing Them from an angle. It was not a full darshan but we did manage to at least see Lord Nityananda and part of Lord Caitanya from a sharp angle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVery shortly thereafter, the pujari opened the main Deity doors. This time we were able to see both of Them fully. I started by going first to Their lotus feet and gradually moved my gaze toward Their smiling faces. I wanted to closely study their features. I took note of Their hand gestures and was thinking to ask if there was a meaning to the way They were holding Their hands. Within in minute, however, if it was even that long, the pujari closed the doors again while we were still standing there, motionless, with our hands folded.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy this time, I remembered that the darshan of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai at this temple is similar to that of Banke Bihari in Vrndavana. The pujari opens and closes the doors at regular intervals to prevent Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda from jumping off the altar as They had previously done in loving reciprocation with Their dear servant, Hrdaya Caitanya.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe pujari then invited us to the last altar and pulled the glass case to the doorway in order in order to show us the Bhagavad-gita which is said (by some) to have been handwritten by Lord Caitanya. He apologized for not being able to open the red satin cloth within which the Bhagavad Gita is bound, explaining that over the years, being exposed to the air, the pages had decayed some of it beyond recognition. We took his word that the actual Bhagavad-gita was there and got down to offer our obeisances upon seeing the red cloth. Detecting some disappointment in us, however, he then focused our flashlight on a small piece of a page which was left open inside the glass case on which a verse from Bhagavad-gita was very delicately handwritten. I have to admit, it was beautiful. I felt a little bit better, although I was definitely hoping for the full darshan.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe pujari then brought out the small oar which, as it is told, was handed by Lord Caitanya to Gauridasa Pandita. While handing it to His devotee, the Lord said, \"With this oar, you may help the fallen souls cross over the ocean of material existence.\" The oar has been kept there for all of these years.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy this time, the kirtan devotees were requesting us to come to the kirtan mandap to lead kirtan. They turned over the microphone to us and we eagerly proceeded to chant several bhajans, while some of them sat and took part in the chanting with us. We then read several pastimes about Gauridasa Pandita, including the above story, chanted once more and were then given small plates of prasadam to honor before leaving.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile taking our last darshan(s) of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai, I decided to ask my question to the pujari about the Deities' hands. He told me that it was to emphasize the importance of counting while chanting. I immediately remembered the verse from Saci-Sutastakam, kara-japya-karam hari-nama-param, and quoted the English to Devamrita Maharaja, \"While chanting He counts the holy names on the fingers of His hands.\" Satisfied with his answer, we gradually gathered our belongings, left daksina with the pujari, as we did everywhere, and returned to the car.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile driving back to Mayapura, we took advantage of the remaining time to stop once again at Nrsimhapalli. This time, although there were pilgrims, it was not at all as crowded as it was last time. We were able to take darshan of Lord Nrsimhadeva for as long as we wanted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI then asked Devamrita Maharaja if he would like to chant the Nrsimha prayers. He quickly agreed, so we brought out the mats and sat down for what I thought would be a short kirtan. However, I so much appreciated the mood after Maharaja's simple, but very heart-felt, kirtan that when he stopped, I couldn't take my fingers off the harmonium keys and started playing another melody, hoping he would continue chanting. Seeing my inclincation to chant more, Maharaja begged me to take over. So I did. For whatever reason, our kirtan really took off. At least thirty pilgrims drew closer to us and started to encircle us. Many of them sat down, and blissfully started clapping their hands, chanting enthusiastically along with us. We were a bit late for lunch that day, but it was definitely worth it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo be continued…\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlease <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj9PXM1oAWrn751hccGsLkofvTPWryO48\">click here to see the playlist of day number five</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n",

I immediately remembered the verse from Saci-Sutastakam, kara-japya-karam hari-nama-param, and quoted the English to Devamrita Maharaja, \"While chanting He counts the holy names on the fingers of His hands.\" Satisfied with his answer, we gradually gathered our belongings, left daksina with the pujari, as we did everywhere, and returned to the car.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile driving back to Mayapura, we took advantage of the remaining time to stop once again at Nrsimhapalli. This time, although there were pilgrims, it was not at all as crowded as it was last time. We were able to take darshan of Lord Nrsimhadeva for as long as we wanted.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI then asked Devamrita Maharaja if he would like to chant the Nrsimha prayers. He quickly agreed, so we brought out the mats and sat down for what I thought would be a short kirtan. However, I so much appreciated the mood after Maharaja's simple, but very heart-felt, kirtan that when he stopped, I couldn't take my fingers off the harmonium keys and started playing another melody, hoping he would continue chanting. Seeing my inclincation to chant more, Maharaja begged me to take over. So I did. For whatever reason, our kirtan really took off. At least thirty pilgrims drew closer to us and started to encircle us. Many of them sat down, and blissfully started clapping their hands, chanting enthusiastically along with us. We were a bit late for lunch that day, but it was definitely worth it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo be continued…\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPlease <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj9PXM1oAWrn751hccGsLkofvTPWryO48\">click here to see the playlist of day number five</a>.\n</p>\n",

We could therefore sit to hear and chant out of the rain. Mamagachi is where the birthplace of Srila Vrndavana dasa Thakur is located. A very short walking distance from there is located the temple where the Deities of Saranga Thakur, Sri Radha Radha-Gopinath are worshiped.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe went first to Vrndavana dasa Thakur's birthplace and immediately took darshan of the presiding Deities Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga, Jagannatha, Baladeva, and Subhadra, (all worshiped by Srila Vrndavana dasa Thakur), and Sri Sri Radha Krsna. Radha Krsna were installed by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur. The temple was very quiet when we entered with only the pujari present. He allowed us to take darshan and to photograph the Deities. He also told us a few stories connected with the tirtha. We then spread our mat and I asked the Maharajas what they would like to do first. The Maharajas seemed to like beginning every session with a bhajan, so I suggested that we chant Saci-sutastakam.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince the beginning of our parikrama, I was trying to assure both Maharajas that I had no fixed plan for the parikrama except that I would find material for us to read each day. I also wanted to assure them that I was open to spontaneity and to hear from them how we should organize each day's hearing and chanting. However, by today it was starting to become more obvious to me that they were fully satisfied simply to chant the bhajans I picked and to read the material I selected for each day. Fortunately, Devamrita Maharaja would also prepare selections from Caitanya Caritamrita for us to read. It did seem, however, that the bhajans were completely up to me to select.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, after chanting Saci-sutastakam and reading the translation, I suggested we chant Gaura Pahu once again and asked if, this time, everyone would like to hear Srila Prabhupada's commentary because I liked it so much. Judging from everyone's smile, I knew there would be no resistance to the proposal and proceeded to read it with great relish.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then read and talked about Srila Vrndavana dasa Thakur, which led to an interesting discussion about defending the sampradaya. This came up when we talked about how strongly Vrndavana dasa Thakur defended Lord Nityananda as illustrated in the following verse from Sri Caitanya Bhagavat, Adi Khanda, Chapter 17, Verses 154-158:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Someone says, 'Nityananda Prabhu is Balarama,' and another says, 'He is the most beloved devotee of Lord Caitanya.' Someone else says, 'He is a powerful personality,' and another says, 'We don't understand who He is.' Someone may consider Nityananda a sannyasi, someone may consider Him a devotee, and someone may consider Him a jnani. They may say whatever they like. Even if Nityananda is a most insignificant servant of Lord Caitanya, I would still keep His lotus feet in my heart. I therefore kick the head of any sinful person who disregards the glories of Lord Nityananda and dares to criticize Him.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaving discussed how foolish people have tried to find fault in Srila Prabhupada's words, it felt refreshing to be reminded about the importance of standing firm on the words of our previous acaryas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then relocated to the Saranga Deva Gaudiya Math where the Deities worshiped by Vasudeva Datta were still being worshiped. There we also took darshan of the Deities worshiped by Saranga Thakur, as well as the Deities of Gaura-Gadadhara. When we arrived, the pujari greeted us with a warm smile and extended us a welcome, both from him and also on behalf of Jagatbandhu, the pujari who had been serving the Deities in this temple for well over sixty years.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI had heard many enlivening stories about Jagatbandhu, especially about his enthusiasm to receive any guest who would arrive at the temple. He had a practice, based upon an order given to him by his spiritual master, to provide prasadam to anyone who visited this temple. Devotees told me stories how he would immediately run into the kitchen to cook sumptuous prasadam for any guest, no matter who they were and no matter what time of day it was. Sometimes, pilgrims would come, wanting only to take darshan. Upon returning with plates of prasadam he had prepared and offered specifically for them, he would sometimes find that his guests had already left. He would then stand there with tears in his eyes for having missed the opportunity to render service to them, anxiously hoping for their return.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately, Jagatbandhu broke his hip some time ago, and is still unable to walk. Although he could stay anywhere, he chose to remain lying all day on the floor by the side of the Deity doors with his bead bag in his hand, chanting the Lord's holy names. When we arrived, he seemed to become more animated by our presence and although he could not hear so well, he launched into reciting pastimes from Caitanya Bhagavat, although he spoke only in Bengali.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe listened for a short time and also briefly spoke with the pujari who had greeted us along with Jagatbandhu. We then proceeded to chant the bhajan Kabe Habe Bolo Se Din Amar. A few children and other sevaites gathered around while we chanted. We then read the pastime of Saranga Thakur and how, despite his reluctance to do so, upon receiving the order from Lord Caitanya to accept disciples, he decided that he would accept the first person he saw the next morning as his disciple.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile taking his bath the next morning, he saw the dead body of a boy floating by. He touched the body with his foot, it came back to life,&nbsp; and Saranga Thakur accepted him on the spot as his disciple. This disciple became famous as Thakur Murari, and faithfully served his spiritual master for the rest of his life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEarlier we had asked Jagatbandhu what bhajan he would like us to chant. He mentioned that he would like us to chant \"Gopinath.\" I suspected that he was attached to that bhajan because the Deities he worshiped were Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough I had not chanted this bhajan for a very long time, I was eager to render some service to this Vaisnava and therefore attempted to chant it, despite the probability that Jagatbandhu couldn't even hear what was being chanted. Still, he sat and attentively watched while we slowly chanted all three parts of the bhajan. We then read the translation and decided that it was already time for us to leave. The pujari brought mahaprasadam for us. We enthusiastically honored the maha, washed our hands, and then circumambulated the bakula tree where Lord Caitanya would sometimes rest when going home from school in Vidyanagara.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then proceeded back to Mayapura.

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tOn the third day of parikrama we decided to drive to Godrumadvipa instead of taking the boat across the Jalangi. After forty minutes of driving we arrived first at Svananda Sukhada Kunja (Bhaktivinode Thakur's house).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUpon entering the compound we saw a woman sitting and loudly chanting bhajans in the kirtan mandap before the Deity of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur. I was hesitant as to whether or not we should usurp her space and expressed my concerns to the other two Maharajas. Within a minute or two, however, we were greeted by a young brahmacari who was apparently in charge at the time. He saw that we were carrying mats and a harmoniun and quickly understood our intentions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe told us that they were going to have a gathering at 9:00 AM in the main temple to welcome the month of Kartika. He assured us that the woman chanting would not be disturbed if were to use that space for our hearing and chanting. He, however, did say that we would need to finish there no later than 9:00 AM. As an alternative, he suggested that we use the veranda outside Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's room for as long as we wanted. Not wanting to restrict the spontaneity of our little parikrama party, we immediately opted to go to the veranda.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was from that veranda that Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur saw the horizon of Mayapura light up across the Jalangi, and foretold that there would be a \"wonderful temple there which would broadcast the eternal service of Lord Gauranga throughout the world\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince it was also the disappearance day of Srila Narottama das Thakur, we agreed that we would first chant \"Saparsada-bhagavad-viraha-janita-vilapa\", the song for departed Vaisnavas by Srila Narottama dasa Thakur. Dhanurdhara Maharaja then suggested that we utilize our time there on the veranda to chant different bhajans composed by Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur and read the translations. We all agreed and decided that we would read about Srila Narottama dasa Thakur during our evening readings back in Mayapura.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI chose to first chant \"Suddha-bhakata-carana-renu\" since it was right there in Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's house that the Thakur had experienced what he had described in that same bhajan, \"je-dina grhe, bhajana dekhi/ grhete goloka bhaya.\" \"One day while performing devotional practices, I saw my house transformed into Goloka Vrndavana.\" While chanting, I was deeply meditating on the words of the song and while reading the translation, we all smiled with the hope of seeing his house transformed into Goloka Vrndavana.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI then asked Devamrita Maharaja if he would like to chant one of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's bhajans, and he enthusiastically responded with, \"Let's chant Jaya Radha Madhava\", which he then proceeded to lead for all of us to follow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore we knew it, the time had passed so quickly that we decided we should move on to Surabhi Kunja. We gathered our paraphernalia, took darshan of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's room as well as the room where Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur used to stay, and proceeded to circumambulate the altar where Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's murti is situated and just around the corner, the altar of his personal Deities, Sri Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu and Sri Sri Gadadhara Pandita. We then prostrated ourselves before Srila Gaura Kisora dasa Babaji's bhajan-kutira, left the compound, and walked the short distance to Surabhi Kunja.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUpon arriving in Surabhi Kunja we immediately noticed that the place where we used to sit had been transformed into a major temple construction site and it even seemed as though it was quite advanced in it's construction. We were very warmly welcomed by the local sevaites, who immediately could understand that we needed a place to sit down to hear and chant. They vacated the veranda of their house and begged us to use it for our satsang. We immediately obliged as they stood nearby in anticipation of what would come next.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEveryone eagerly wanted to continue chanting Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's bhajans. So we then chanted \"Boro sukher kabor gai,\" which mentions Surabhi Kunja, as the place where Lord Nityananda Himself opened a market place of the Holy Name. By that time some local pilgrims had gathered around and seeing our enthusiasm for chanting, some of them immediately started to eagerly chant and dance along with the kirtan.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy this time I was feeling overwhelmed by the mood of our small parikrama party, inspired by everyone's absorption in hearing and chanting. I then began to more deeply meditate upon the words of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur in that bhajan and the great mercy of Nityananda Prabhu, Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur, and of all our previous acaryas. Seeing everyone chanting, knowing that we were all chanting by the mercy of these transcendental personalities, increased my desire to take shelter of their mercy and the holy name more and more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe chanted another bhajan, and then while reading from Navadvipa Dhama Mahatmya about the island of Godrumadvipa, one young Gaudiya Math sannyasi came to sit with us. He listened for awhile and then welcomed us to Surabhi Kunja. He pointed to a picture of his Guru Maharaja which was hanging there on the veranda, someone who I had neither heard of nor seen before, and told us that he had been requested by him to build a temple (pointing to the temple construction). He then apologized for his having appeared before us in a gamcha, but since he had dedicated himself to fulfilling that order and even to the construction of the building itself, he was often not in his sannyasa dress.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe did not speak that much English, so through Thakur Saranga Prabhu's translation he told us that he had one of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's works in handwriting and asked if we would like to see it. Naturally, we expressed our enthusiasm to take darshan of the book. He then retrieved it for us and eagerly showed us page after page.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThakur Saranga began reading the Bengali script and we immediately recognized it as one of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's bhajans. Needless to say, we were enlivened by the opportunity to hold, to see, and and to hear directly from this most sacred book and the sannyasi was undoubtedly enlivened to share it with us. He then asked us if we would chant the bhajan, \"Sri Godruma-Candra-Bhajana-Upadesa. For some reason, I did not immediately recognize the name of the bhajan and therefore asked if he would chant it for us. But Madana-mohana reminded me that it was the bhajan which began with the words \"yadi te hari-pada-saroja-sudha\". Immediately recognizing the words, I said, \"I think I can chant if you like.\", and he asked me to please do so. With the permission of my godbrothers, we then chanted that bhajan and then Dhanurdhara Maharaja read the translation so deeply absorbed in his reading that I felt as if I was present in Godruma's forest bowers eagerly waiting for Lord Gaura to bestow His mercy upon us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then decided that, considering our schedule, it was probably best to move on to Nrsimhapalli, which was to be our last stop before returning to Mayapura. However, our hosts would not allow us to leave without honoring prasadam first. They had prepared a little something for us while we were chanting the last bhajan. Fortunately, it was not a large quantity. We honored as much as we could, thanked them for their hospitality, and then parted with a warm embrace from the sannyasi. He seemed genuinely grateful that we had come. He thanked us several times for our association and begged us to please come again as soon as possible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we arrived at Nrsimhapalli, there were busloads of pilgrims mulling around and a large group of them were sitting in front of the Deity getting mahaprasadam from the pujari. The mood there was quite different from that which we had experienced on parikrama thus far. Everywhere else we had visited was relatively quiet and thus conducive for hearing and chanting. Nonethless, we still decided to at least take darshan of the self-manifested deity of Lord Nrsimha.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFortunately, the crowd allowed us to gain access to the altar for darshan. After darshan, we then decided to sit on the mandap for a short kirtan for Lord Nrsimhadeva, which was led by Acyuta Priya Prabhu. Devamrita Maharaja then very feelingly read Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's prayers to Lord Nrsimhadeva from Navadvipa Dhama Mahatmya. We then left, but discussed the possibility of visiting there once again since we had to drive past it at least once more when we would go to Ambika Kalna.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor video clips of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2INQzgRVtE&amp;list=PLj9PXM1oAWrmB0dMolc3pYloBYRfu6-Go\">day three, please click here</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo be continued…\r\n</p>\r\n",

We then prostrated ourselves before Srila Gaura Kisora dasa Babaji's bhajan-kutira, left the compound, and walked the short distance to Surabhi Kunja.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUpon arriving in Surabhi Kunja we immediately noticed that the place where we used to sit had been transformed into a major temple construction site and it even seemed as though it was quite advanced in it's construction. We were very warmly welcomed by the local sevaites, who immediately could understand that we needed a place to sit down to hear and chant. They vacated the veranda of their house and begged us to use it for our satsang. We immediately obliged as they stood nearby in anticipation of what would come next.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEveryone eagerly wanted to continue chanting Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's bhajans. So we then chanted \"Boro sukher kabor gai,\" which mentions Surabhi Kunja, as the place where Lord Nityananda Himself opened a market place of the Holy Name. By that time some local pilgrims had gathered around and seeing our enthusiasm for chanting, some of them immediately started to eagerly chant and dance along with the kirtan.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBy this time I was feeling overwhelmed by the mood of our small parikrama party, inspired by everyone's absorption in hearing and chanting. I then began to more deeply meditate upon the words of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur in that bhajan and the great mercy of Nityananda Prabhu, Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur, and of all our previous acaryas. Seeing everyone chanting, knowing that we were all chanting by the mercy of these transcendental personalities, increased my desire to take shelter of their mercy and the holy name more and more.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe chanted another bhajan, and then while reading from Navadvipa Dhama Mahatmya about the island of Godrumadvipa, one young Gaudiya Math sannyasi came to sit with us. He listened for awhile and then welcomed us to Surabhi Kunja. He pointed to a picture of his Guru Maharaja which was hanging there on the veranda, someone who I had neither heard of nor seen before, and told us that he had been requested by him to build a temple (pointing to the temple construction). He then apologized for his having appeared before us in a gamcha, but since he had dedicated himself to fulfilling that order and even to the construction of the building itself, he was often not in his sannyasa dress.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe did not speak that much English, so through Thakur Saranga Prabhu's translation he told us that he had one of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's works in handwriting and asked if we would like to see it. Naturally, we expressed our enthusiasm to take darshan of the book. He then retrieved it for us and eagerly showed us page after page.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThakur Saranga began reading the Bengali script and we immediately recognized it as one of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's bhajans. Needless to say, we were enlivened by the opportunity to hold, to see, and and to hear directly from this most sacred book and the sannyasi was undoubtedly enlivened to share it with us. He then asked us if we would chant the bhajan, \"Sri Godruma-Candra-Bhajana-Upadesa. For some reason, I did not immediately recognize the name of the bhajan and therefore asked if he would chant it for us. But Madana-mohana reminded me that it was the bhajan which began with the words \"yadi te hari-pada-saroja-sudha\". Immediately recognizing the words, I said, \"I think I can chant if you like.\", and he asked me to please do so. With the permission of my godbrothers, we then chanted that bhajan and then Dhanurdhara Maharaja read the translation so deeply absorbed in his reading that I felt as if I was present in Godruma's forest bowers eagerly waiting for Lord Gaura to bestow His mercy upon us.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe then decided that, considering our schedule, it was probably best to move on to Nrsimhapalli, which was to be our last stop before returning to Mayapura. However, our hosts would not allow us to leave without honoring prasadam first. They had prepared a little something for us while we were chanting the last bhajan. Fortunately, it was not a large quantity. We honored as much as we could, thanked them for their hospitality, and then parted with a warm embrace from the sannyasi. He seemed genuinely grateful that we had come. He thanked us several times for our association and begged us to please come again as soon as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we arrived at Nrsimhapalli, there were busloads of pilgrims mulling around and a large group of them were sitting in front of the Deity getting mahaprasadam from the pujari. The mood there was quite different from that which we had experienced on parikrama thus far. Everywhere else we had visited was relatively quiet and thus conducive for hearing and chanting. Nonethless, we still decided to at least take darshan of the self-manifested deity of Lord Nrsimha.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFortunately, the crowd allowed us to gain access to the altar for darshan. After darshan, we then decided to sit on the mandap for a short kirtan for Lord Nrsimhadeva, which was led by Acyuta Priya Prabhu. Devamrita Maharaja then very feelingly read Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's prayers to Lord Nrsimhadeva from Navadvipa Dhama Mahatmya. We then left, but discussed the possibility of visiting there once again since we had to drive past it at least once more when we would go to Ambika Kalna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor video clips of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2INQzgRVtE&amp;list=PLj9PXM1oAWrmB0dMolc3pYloBYRfu6-Go\">day three, please click here</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo be continued…\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tOn the second day of parikrama we proceeded directly to Sri Caitanya Math. This temple was Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's headquarters for his preaching througout India. He called it Vrndavana Pattan, which means the place where the Vrndavana forest is manifest. There, just behind the temple, you can find Radha Kunda, Syama Kunda, and off to the side, just next to Srila Gaura Kisora dasa Babaji's samadhi, you will also find Govardhana Hill.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wanted to start first at Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's samadhi, since that is the first place you come upon when entering the main gate. We therefore carried our paraphernalia, (mats, cushions, instruments, etc.) to the samadhi. As we were about to place everything on the floor, we noticed that one of the brahmacaris was meticulously washing the floor. He very respectfully asked if we could wait fifteen minutes before setting everything down until he finished and suggested we first take darshan of the presiding Deities, Sri Sri Radha Gandharvika-Giridhari in the temple nearby. He then thoughtfully cleaned a spot where we could keep everything until we returned.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we arrived in the temple, the Deity doors were still closed but we were told that the darshan would be in ten minutes. We therefore sat down, waited, and discussed philosophy until the Deity doors opened. At 7:45 the doors opened and we were all overwhelmed by the beautiful presence of Their Lordships. I turned to the devotees and said, \"Let's have a kirtan for Them!\", and asked Dhanurdhara Maharaja if he would chant Yasomati-Nandana. He resisted, but with a little prodding he finally agreed. Everyone enthusiastically chanted with arms outstretched. I accompanied him with the mrdanga. After kirtan, we took carinamrita and then returned to Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's samadhi.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere we started first with a kirtan and then we read for at least an hour about Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's childhood and early years, leading up to the time he spent in Mayapura. We also read Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's instructions to Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur about the importance of Sri Mayapura Dhama. Before Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur departed he instructed Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in this letter to start circumambulation of Sridhama Mayapura as soon as possible and to make sure that service to Mayapura will become permanent. So many other instructions were given to him in this one letter and we could immediately appreciate how Srila Bhaktisiddhanta took these instructions upon his head as a major part of his life's work in service to the divine instructions of his father and preceptor, Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter a couple of hours at Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Thakur's samadhi we proceeded to Srila Gaura Kisora dasa Babaji Maharaja's samadhi, but since Govardhana Hill was so nearby we decided to first circumambulate Govardhana Hill three times before entering the samadhi. There we read for about an hour about Srila Gaura Kisora dasa Babaji's life from the book entitled, \"Babaji Maharaja\". One pastime which stands out in my mind took place in Sridhama Mayapura, while Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur was living at the Yoga Pitha.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce Srila Gaura Kisora dasa Babaji Maharaja arrived alone at the Yoga Pitha in the early morning hours. Later that day, knowing that Srila Gaura Kisora dasa Babaji Maharaja was externally completely blind, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta asked Babaji Maharaja what time he had arrived. Babaji Maharaja told him that he had arrived about two in the morning. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was naturally surprised and further inquired how it was possible for him to come alone, especially since there were no footpaths from Kuliya to Mayapura and there were no landing places for boats along the Ganga. He was wondering who would bring him such a long distance by the hand and then upon arriving, suddenly leave in the middle of the night. Babaji Maharaja nonchalantly responded, \"Someone showed me the proper way.\" Again Srila Bhaktisiddhanta submitted his question and Srila Gaura Kisora dasa Babaji in an amused manner replied, \"Someone took me across the river.\" Srila Bhaktisiddhanta could then understand that the mysterious person could have been no one other than Krsna Himself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe chanted another bhajan, and then proceeded to the home of Murari Gupta which was down the path through the field behind Sri Caitanya Math. Upon arriving in the temple, there was an elderly pujari dressed in saffron sitting in front of the altar stringing garlands for the Deity. He seemed so content in his service, but as soon as I approached the altar, he immediately got down on the floor in front of me and offered his obeisances at my feet. I stood in front of him with my hands folded as I oftentimes do, especially since it is not easy for me to repeatedly get down because of my bad back. My back was also especially hurting from having sat so long on the floor that morning. I therefore respectfully offered my pranamas to him, he returned to his Deity seva and I continued to circumambulate the Deity room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile circumambulating, I realized how foolish I was that I had not gotten down to offer my obeisances to this Vaisnava who must have been at least fifteen to twenty years senior in age to me and reminded myself that I should not be illusioned into thinking that I am a sannyasi and therefore do not need to offer my obeisances to such a senior Vaisnava. The next time I came before him, I immediately got down on the floor and offered my obeisances to him while he was sitting in front of the altar making the garland. To my dismay, he stopped his seva, got down, and immediately returned his obeisances to me, thus teaching me an very important lesson in humility. In my heart I felt very grateful to this Vaisnava for, knowingly or unknowingly, teaching me such an important lesson about humility.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI couldn't explain it but there was something very special about the atmosphere there. I expressed this to the others and Devamrita Maharaja reminded me that I was saying that about every place we had been so far. I thought about it and within I had to agree that I probably was saying that about every place because that's just how I was feeling. In my heart I was starting to feel how all of Sri Mayapura Dhama is such a special place filled with so much mercy. I was then reminded about Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur's words in \"Sri Navadvipa Dhama Mahatmya\" while describing the glories of Sri Navadvipa Dhama.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"As long as bodily consciousness is not given up and humility does not awaken within, one cannot obtain the treasure of Sri Caitanya and Sri Nityananda's mercy, no matter what efforts one make, even if he be Siva or Brahma.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn my heart, I once again thanked the pujari who was teaching me by his example the importance of humility and realized just how much more I had to learn about this most essential quality if I really wanted to experience the mercy of Sri Mayapura Dhama.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe then proceeded to chant, and began reading so many wonderful pastimes from Caitanya Bhagavata and Caitanya Caritamrita about Murari Gupta's love for Lord Caitanya. We read for at least another hour, in a very animated way, the wonderful pastimes which took place in the home of Murari Gupta.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the end of our reading there was an arati, so we had a very enthusiastic kirtan while the pujari offered arati to the Sita, Rama, Laksmana and Hanuman. After he blew the conchshell, he turned to me and said something to me in Bengali. I sensed that he wanted me to say the prema-dhvani, but being unsure I just looked at him, and then to Thakur Saranga dasa who spoke Bengali. Unfortunately, I wasn't fast enough and seeing my predicament, he starting reciting the prema-dhvani prayers which probably lasted for at least five to seven minutes. We all looked at each other, marveling the intensity and enthusiasm this pujari displayed for glorifying the the Lord, the Vaisnavas and all the sacred places of pilgrimage. We then took carinamrita, and some mahaprasadam which the pujari distributed to all of us and realized that it was already time to return for the day. What a wonderful day!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor video clips of Day Two, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhmi_Fb6T0Q&amp;list=PLj9PXM1oAWrl-LJUWG0rJgNm66v07WrGZ\">click here</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo be continued…\r\n</p>\r\n",

Still, they consist of bhajans, kirtans, parts of our readings, and some deity darshans.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese clips have been put together into playlists, which include all of the clips he had taken each day. We will try to post these playlists here on the site on a daily basis and I will also try to write a few words about our parikrama for that day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe day before our parikrama began, we all decided that we would leave at 7:00 AM every morning and that we would return by 1:00 PM. By leaving at 7:00, it also enabled me to take care of all my newly prescribed morning rituals which consist of mixing and taking medicines and heating and applying different medicinal oils. I was also able to complete sixteen rounds before departing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis schedule gave us six solid hours for parikrama each day. Of course, some days were spent driving significant distances on roads which had been destroyed by the heavy rains during the rainy season. Still, our unanimous conclusion was that even the six-hour drive to Katwa and back (we returned at 4:00 PM on that day), traveling on a fifteen to twenty kilometer patch of the worst road I have ever ridden on in my life, was worth it. Every tirtha we visited provided us the most wonderful venue for hearing, chanting, praying to, and remembering the Lord and His eternal associates.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn the first day of our parikrama we left promptly at 7:00 and walked together to the Yoga Pitha. Upon entering we discovered that there was another group of devotees in the kirtan hall, so we decided to have our kirtan and reading at the small temple where Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur is worshiped, just to the right upon entering the compound.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEach day I selected relevant pastimes for the tirthas we visited, mostly from Caitanya Bhagavata and Caitanya Caritamrita. At Yoga Pitha we read about the appearance of the Lord's associates, the reason why they appeared in places other than in Navadvipa, and how they all gathered in Navadvipa to assist the Lord in His divine pastimes. We also read some of the Lord's childhood pastimes. All three of us, Dhanurdhara Maharaja, Devamrita Maharaja, and I, took turns reading from the selected references. Between readings we chanted bhajans, and read the translations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter reading and chanting for at least two hours, we moved on to Srivas Angan, where we chanted and had wonderfully animated and exceptionally absorbing readings from Caitanya Bhagavata, describing the kirtans which the Lord conducted in Srivasa Pandita's home and especially the maha-prakasa lila, or the sata-prahariya bhava—the Lord's ecstasy of twenty-one hours. After spending at least another two hours hearing and chanting in Srivasa Angan, and especially after the last kirtan we had in that most auspicious place which is considered the rasa-sthali of Navadvipa, I was already convinced that this was going to be a very memorable nine days for me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom Srivasa Angana we walked down the path to Advaita Acarya's house. We chanted a bhajan and then read from Caitanya Bhagavata about the pastimes performed there. We returned to our residence by 1:00, showered, and then Dhanurdhara Maharaja, Devamrita Maharaja, and I took our lunches together until approximately 3:00 PM. We left 3:00 – 7:30 PM open as free time for reading, preparing our readings for the next day, and resting. We then gathered again in the evening for Damodarastakam and more readings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore we began parikrama, we had decided that only English would be spoken throughout the whole nine days. This means that translations were not allowed at any time in order to keep the readings and the mood flowing.

Still, they consist of bhajans, kirtans, parts of our readings, and some deity darshans.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese clips have been put together into playlists, which include all of the clips he had taken each day. We will try to post these playlists here on the site on a daily basis and I will also try to write a few words about our parikrama for that day.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe day before our parikrama began, we all decided that we would leave at 7:00 AM every morning and that we would return by 1:00 PM. By leaving at 7:00, it also enabled me to take care of all my newly prescribed morning rituals which consist of mixing and taking medicines and heating and applying different medicinal oils. I was also able to complete sixteen rounds before departing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis schedule gave us six solid hours for parikrama each day. Of course, some days were spent driving significant distances on roads which had been destroyed by the heavy rains during the rainy season. Still, our unanimous conclusion was that even the six-hour drive to Katwa and back (we returned at 4:00 PM on that day), traveling on a fifteen to twenty kilometer patch of the worst road I have ever ridden on in my life, was worth it. Every tirtha we visited provided us the most wonderful venue for hearing, chanting, praying to, and remembering the Lord and His eternal associates.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the first day of our parikrama we left promptly at 7:00 and walked together to the Yoga Pitha. Upon entering we discovered that there was another group of devotees in the kirtan hall, so we decided to have our kirtan and reading at the small temple where Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur is worshiped, just to the right upon entering the compound.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEach day I selected relevant pastimes for the tirthas we visited, mostly from Caitanya Bhagavata and Caitanya Caritamrita. At Yoga Pitha we read about the appearance of the Lord's associates, the reason why they appeared in places other than in Navadvipa, and how they all gathered in Navadvipa to assist the Lord in His divine pastimes.

October 15th was the first day I was allowed to leave the room without restriction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, now that the intensive treatments are over, practically all day long there are new treatments and medicines I've needed to take. All together these have taken up a significant amount of my time. I'm reading. But I've not had the same opportunity for reading which was available to me during the previous eleven days. I've also been spending every evening with Sivarama Maharaja for kirtan and katha. Hence, I've had less time to write blogs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tToday, instead of writing about my readings, I decided to answer one of the questions given to me during one of our sessions at Bhakti Sangama Festival. Here is the question:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Do I understand it correctly, that unless and until we work in devotional service until we almost drop dead, we cannot develop love for Krsna?\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough I'm sure that not everyone drew this conclusion from the example I gave on the second day of my seminar, when I read this question I became concerned that possibly other devotees were thinking this way. For this reason, I've chosen this question to answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI suspect that this question was asked because of the story I told about Mother Yasoda's \"exhausting\" efforts to tie up her mischievous son, Krsna. During the course of my talk, I had paraphrased Srila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur's commentary, part of which is as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Krsna’s mercy, which reigns as the king of all His potencies and illuminates all others, melts the heart of the Lord and turns it into butter. The appearance of Krsna’s mercy made His satya sankalpa and vibhuti saktis immediately disappear. The distance of two fingers was filled by the devotee’s effort and hard work (parisramam) and the Lord’s causeless mercy (krsna krpa). The bhakta-nistha (firm faith of the devotee) seen in his tireless endeavors to serve and worship the Lord, and the sva-nistha (the steady quality in the Lord), which brings forth His mercy upon seeing the devotee’s effort and fatigue caused Krsna to be bound.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur is helping us understand the importance of making our own efforts to please Krsna. A devotee always endeavors for Krsna's mercy and knows that without His mercy, which manifests both from Krsna and through His devotees, he cannot achieve pure love for Krsna. We can (and in fact, should) expect Krsna's mercy, but whenever He wishes to give it. However, without making efforts to please Krsna, it would be an illusion to think that love of God will manifest in our hearts automatically without them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe \"tireless endeavors\" to serve the Lord, however, does not refer to the physical efforts made in service to Krsna. It may, but it really depends on what the Lord, or His devotee, wants from us for the Lord's pleasure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe should therefore not be misled into thinking that Mother Yasoda's \"tireless endeavors\" were something that were physically exhausting for her. She is not \"physically exhausted\" by anything. She is ecstatically engaged, one hundred percent, on the spiritual platform of unalloyed love for Krsna and Krsna is eternally pleased by this unalloyed love of His mother. In one sense, therefore, Krsna already has everything He wants from Yasoda. He has a mother whose only desire is to serve Krsna exclusively as her son.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn our case, however, we have to endeavor to achieve Krsna's pleasure because it's only unalloyed love which fully pleases Him. And even those who have unalloyed love, never think that they have it. Krsna's pleasure is the ultimate goal of our sadhana and not the goal of our physical work. Our tireless endeavors and the fatigue which manifests from such endeavors, come from our efforts to please Krsna by constantly remembering Him, by worshiping Him, and by offering our prayers unto Him. While executing our service, Krsna knows when we are thinking only of His pleasure and He is also very inclined to help us in our endeavors when He sees how determined we are to please Him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

Within the context of the purport, Srila Prabhupada rendered Verses 151 – 155, Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya Lila, Chapter 19, in the most beautiful way. These were Lord Caitanya's instructions to Srila Rupa Goswami which include the often quoted verse:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\r\n\t<em>brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva<br />\r\n\tguru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese verses were cited in reference to Uddhava.

Upon hearing his inquiries, Uddhava immediately remembered the Lord, and became so absorbed in transcendental ecstasy that he forgot all about the external world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn his purport, Srila Prabhupada writes, \" Even though a pure devotee is present on this mortal planet, he is here in relation to the Lord for engagement in transcendental loving service, and not for any material cause. A living entity can live either on the material plane or in the transcendental abode of the Lord, in accordance with his existential condition.

This taste is the seed of devotional service, and one who is fortunate enough to have received such a seed is advised to sow it in the core of his heart. As one cultivates a seed by pouring water to fructify it, the seed of devotional service sown in the heart of the devotee may be cultured by pouring water in the form of hearing and chanting of the holy name and pastimes of the Lord. The creeper of devotional service, so nourished, gradually grows, and the devotee, acting as a gardener, goes on pouring the water of constant hearing and chanting. The creeper of devotional service gradually grows so high that it passes through the entire material universe and enters into the spiritual sky, growing still higher and higher until it reaches the planet Goloka Vrndavana. The devotee-gardener is in touch with the abode of the Lord even from the material plane by dint of performing devotional service to the Lord simply by hearing and chanting. As a creeper takes shelter of another, stronger tree, similarly the creeper of devotional service, nourished by the devotee, takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and thus becomes fixed. When the creeper is fixed, then the fruit of the creeper comes into existence, and the gardener who nourished it is able to enjoy this fruit of love, and his life becomes successful.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWonderful!

Although I oftentimes refer to Srila Prabhupada's lectures from the prayers of Queen Kunti as some of my most favorite lectures, I'm also very attracted to the lectures Srila Prabhupada gave in New York in 1966 on the Caitanya Caritamrita. So, one by one, I've been once again listening to them every day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I listen to these lectures I marvel upon Srila Prabhupada's quality of compassion. None of Srila Prabhupada's books were published in November/December 1966 other than the few Srimad Bhagavatams he brought with him from India. Srila Prabhupada had to give everything to his audience in his talks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt's simply wonderful to hear how Srila Prabhupada introduces bhakti to his fledgling devotees. Not only am I enamored by the content of Srila Prabhupada's talks, but also by the intonation of his voice. His voice is like that of a loving and caring father, carefully holding his children's hands as he encourages them to learn how to walk.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere is something which caught my attention in yesterday's lecture:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Always remember that this Krsna consciousness is a sort of declaration of war with this illusory material nature. So there is war. She will always try to get you fall down. Daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya [Bg. 7.14]. It is very strong, powerful. How you can save yourself? Mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te. If you persistently simply adhere to the devotional service of Krsna, there will be no more strength of this illusory nature to drag you. No more. There will be no more power to get you into this province of sense gratification. Material nature means the jurisdiction of sense gratification. That's all. Simply people are engaged by sense gratification like cats and dogs. That's all. This is material atmosphere. And in the spiritual atmosphere there is no sense gratification; there is only activity for satisfying the Supreme, Krsna. That is the difference.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"So if you adherently be always engaged in some sort of service, twenty-four hours in the service of the Supreme Lord Krsna in Krsna consciousness, there is no power in the world who can drag you into this sense gratification province. You at once become nirguna. This is the process. So we have to stick to this principle: \"How I can serve Krsna always, always?\" Iha yasya harer dasye. If you cannot do, if you simply think, \"How can I do? How can I do? How can I do?\" simply this, if you practically cannot do, but if you simply think that \"How can I do?\" oh, then also you become liberated. Then also you become liberated. And what to speak of when we actually serve. This is such a nice thing, Krsna consciousness. So if you want to save yourself from this material turmoil, then always stick to this Krsna consciousness persistently.

A devotee is always in a renounced temperament because the worldly attractions can never satisfy him. Vidura was never attracted by the royal palace of his brother. He was always ready to leave the place and devote himself completely to the transcendental loving service of the Lord.

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tAs I mentioned in my earlier blog, Sacinananda Maharaja created several ficticious personalities in his book to represent different sides of the individual that surface during his or her spiritual journey. Sanatana Baba is our deeply spiritual self who genuinely seeks the truth and Visvambhara represents our doubting side.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe last time we heard from Sanatana Baba (who was speaking to Visvambhara) he explained the need to become silent to the outside and inside world in order to hear the mantra properly. He continues:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"I feel that to chant the holy name is to pass from a state where mercy is only secretly present in our heart to the state of an inner awareness of the presence and the voice of the Lord – not as a passive theory, but as an active divine revelation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut how are we to start? When the door to the world closes behind us, how do we move forward to enter his living world? How do we move from merely repeating words to truly entering a flow of divine communication? My answer starts here: first establish a connection! Chanting requires building up, as in any relationship. Of course relationships of love are not built from step-by-step rules, but there are always a few principles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first principle is to take on a cooperative mood, and express that mood by making serious efforts to chant with faith. This will attract the beautiful name to hear your chanting! The next principle is the effort to at least be attentive. At the very least, try to chant without external&nbsp; interruptions. Attach your mind to the Divine names, one by one as they move over your tongue. To be attentive, you must be present – 'in the here and now' – relentlessly. Practice it! Bind your mind to the \"naked now\" – weld it to the name, which is right now! Seize the present name. To be attentive and present you must be patient. Endure your inner dryness that always pushes your thoughts into seeking relief in the \"oasis\" of past or future possibilities. There is no past or future; they are only figments of the mind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna will be watching all this from a hidden place. He is especially interested to see where you will run for relief in those dull moments of dryness. Convince him that you know that only he can truly relieve you, and then he will come out of hiding. He will respond to you in the heart when the time is right. Meanwhile, be happy to stay in his presence.\" [End of quote]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

When the door to the world closes behind us, how do we move forward to enter his living world? How do we move from merely repeating words to truly entering a flow of divine communication?

If everyone books their departure for late morning on September 22nd, then obviously there will not be sufficient time to meet with everyone.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you know somebody who requires this information, please pass it on.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you very much.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHare Krsna\n</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tDear Srila Prabhupada,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlease accept my prostrated obeisances in the dust of your beautiful, soft, and exceptionally cool, two lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tToday is your Vyasa Puja. It's the time for me to take a closer look into the heart I offered you forty years ago and to honestly assess whether or not I've lived up to your expectations. As I stand before you today, unfortunately I feel prone to lament more than anything else. I am so much in need of your mercy, but what have I done to qualify myself for all the mercy the most magnanimous Lord Nityananda has empowered you to give? Whatever I've done, there is one thing I'm sure of—it was not enough. There is so much more I know that you expect from me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese days, the topic of mercy is something I speak about a lot. I must speak about it because I know that I'm desperately in need of it. The simple truth, known only to those who are worthy to be considered as a devotee by the Lord and His pure devotees, is that a devotee is one who is always dependent upon the mercy of the Lord and His pure devotees. But I have no right to get the Lord's mercy. I have no right to even ask the Lord for His mercy. Why should He even listen to me? Who am I? I have not bound Him within the core of my heart.  I have not served Him in any way that would be pleasing to Him. I do not desperately call out to Him like a child calling for his mother. I don't remember Him in both happiness and distress. In fact, I don't remember Him in any condition of life. I haven't surrendered my life to Him—what to speak of the fact that I haven't surrendered anything at all unto Him. And worst of all is that I have absolutely no love for Him. Why should He give me even a drop of His mercy?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet I have the audacity to quote Lord Brahma in lectures again and again that, \"if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your [Krsna's] lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your [Krsna's] personality\", as if I have understood something significant about Krsna's personality. The sad truth is that I know nothing about the greatness of Krsna's personality and the reason for that is so obvious. I've done absolutely nothing to qualify myself for even the slightest trace of a trace of His mercy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet, somehow, by some unimaginable good fortune, created only by you, despite all my disqualifications, Krsna, the Supersoul in everyone's heart, revealed something to me forty years ago about the greatness of YOUR personality. I don't know what I did to deserve that mercy, but since it has been confirmed in sastra that it comes only by the combined mercy of Krsna and you, I can only conclude that you must have somehow included this insignicant jiva in your prayers when you asked Krsna to give out that mercy. Certainly I did not ask for it. I didn't even know it existed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tnaivopayanty apacitim kavayas tavesa<br />\r\n\tbrahmayusapi krtam rddha-mudah smarantah<br />\r\n\tyo 'ntar bahis tanu-bhrtam asubham vidhunvann<br />\r\n\tacarya-caittya-vapusa sva-gatim vyanakti\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tO my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahma, for You appear in two features -- externally as the acarya and internally as the Supersoul -- to deliver the embodied living being by directing him how to come to You. [SB 11.29.6]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrsna listens to you. You have everything from Krsna that I don't have. You are the true possessor of Krsna's mercy and it is you who has the power to pour upon me more and more of that same mercy which was revealed to me then. But it seems that even though forty years have passed since the time I received His mercy through you and from Him, still I have not lived up to your expectations. I need to become ever-increasingly greedy for your mercy.

				"safe_value": "<p>\n\tDear Srila Prabhupada,\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPlease accept my prostrated obeisances in the dust of your beautiful, soft, and exceptionally cool, two lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tToday is your Vyasa Puja. It's the time for me to take a closer look into the heart I offered you forty years ago and to honestly assess whether or not I've lived up to your expectations. As I stand before you today, unfortunately I feel prone to lament more than anything else. I am so much in need of your mercy, but what have I done to qualify myself for all the mercy the most magnanimous Lord Nityananda has empowered you to give? Whatever I've done, there is one thing I'm sure of—it was not enough. There is so much more I know that you expect from me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese days, the topic of mercy is something I speak about a lot. I must speak about it because I know that I'm desperately in need of it. The simple truth, known only to those who are worthy to be considered as a devotee by the Lord and His pure devotees, is that a devotee is one who is always dependent upon the mercy of the Lord and His pure devotees. But I have no right to get the Lord's mercy. I have no right to even ask the Lord for His mercy. Why should He even listen to me? Who am I? I have not bound Him within the core of my heart.  I have not served Him in any way that would be pleasing to Him. I do not desperately call out to Him like a child calling for his mother. I don't remember Him in both happiness and distress. In fact, I don't remember Him in any condition of life. I haven't surrendered my life to Him—what to speak of the fact that I haven't surrendered anything at all unto Him. And worst of all is that I have absolutely no love for Him. Why should He give me even a drop of His mercy?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYet I have the audacity to quote Lord Brahma in lectures again and again that, \"if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your [Krsna's] lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your [Krsna's] personality\", as if I have understood something significant about Krsna's personality. The sad truth is that I know nothing about the greatness of Krsna's personality and the reason for that is so obvious. I've done absolutely nothing to qualify myself for even the slightest trace of a trace of His mercy.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYet, somehow, by some unimaginable good fortune, created only by you, despite all my disqualifications, Krsna, the Supersoul in everyone's heart, revealed something to me forty years ago about the greatness of YOUR personality. I don't know what I did to deserve that mercy, but since it has been confirmed in sastra that it comes only by the combined mercy of Krsna and you, I can only conclude that you must have somehow included this insignicant jiva in your prayers when you asked Krsna to give out that mercy. Certainly I did not ask for it. I didn't even know it existed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tnaivopayanty apacitim kavayas tavesa<br />\n\tbrahmayusapi krtam rddha-mudah smarantah<br />\n\tyo 'ntar bahis tanu-bhrtam asubham vidhunvann<br />\n\tacarya-caittya-vapusa sva-gatim vyanakti\n</p>\n<p>\n\tO my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahma, for You appear in two features -- externally as the acarya and internally as the Supersoul -- to deliver the embodied living being by directing him how to come to You. [SB 11.29.6]\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKrsna listens to you. You have everything from Krsna that I don't have. You are the true possessor of Krsna's mercy and it is you who has the power to pour upon me more and more of that same mercy which was revealed to me then. But it seems that even though forty years have passed since the time I received His mercy through you and from Him, still I have not lived up to your expectations. I need to become ever-increasingly greedy for your mercy. I know that there must be no limits to the mercy you carry, because every day of my life I see so many examples of those who have received it from you.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I travel to so many places throughout the world, I see people come to life when they hear about you.

Still, the indications were that my digestive disorders need to be dealt with more attentively in order to avoid more serious consequences in the future. No surgeries are required.

But it was my decision to put the new site up now.</p>\n<p>Please, therefore, do not post any comments assuming that the details which are not available on the site now were intentional ommissions by the admininstrators.

The event was advertised as a lecture by Niranjana Swami on the topic of \"developing loving relationships in the age of conflict and hypocrisy.\" More than a hundred people attended, many of them were relatively new people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI began my talk by explaining the symptoms of the current age. I then explained how conflict, one of the primary symptoms of this age, was due to selfishness, both individual and collective. In order to overcome the prevailing influence of selfishness, one needed to learn how to love and I then gave the foundational principles of loving relationships. I explained how real love could be expressed only from the spiritual platform and then briefly explained how this love was experienced by the soul and not by the body.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the course of describing the symptoms of love, I gave the example which Srila Prabhupada often used that the closest example of love in this world was the love the mother had towards her child. For some reason, unknown to me at the time, I felt compelled to then tell about the relationship I had with my own mother and how she still accepted me even though my goals in life did not meet her expectations. I described my own disappointment with my efforts to offer my love to her from the spiritual platform and how she was uninterested in knowing anything about the existence of the soul or about our eternal relationship with Krsna, even up until her physical demise. From that point, I gave a detailed account of the events which led up to the time I was chanting for my mother while she took her last breath.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLittle did I know at the time that Italians are well-known for the affection they have towards their mothers. Not only that, but I was also totally unaware that the next day, May 12th, was \"Mother's Day\", the day when everyone shows appreciation to their mothers. I was therefore surprised to see how the story of a son's effort to return a debt to his mother from the spiritual platform, and how the culmination of that effort took place where he chanted Krsna's name for her at the time of her death, moved many of those in attendance to tears.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUpon completing my account of my mother, I explained how the distribution of Krsna's names in this age was a true manifestation of love, since it was being offered to anyone who is simply willing to take them and they are offered without expecting anything in return.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the lecture we had an amazing kirtan. Everyone took part so enthusiastically that I was also moved to tears to see how Lord Caitanya's mercy and kindness was so much available to everyone by Srila Prabhupada's loving grace. There was not the least bit of doubt in my mind that Srila Prabhupada appeared in this world as the personification of Lord Caitanya's love. It is only due to his mercy that I could speak on how to love in this age of conflict and hypocrisy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast night Trai Prabhu invited about twelve to fifteen local devotees and aspiring devotees to his home for kirtan, questions and answers. We chanted and answered their questions for several hours. Although Trai Prabhu tried to end at a reasonable time, it seemed nobody wanted to leave despite Trai Prabhu's suggestions that the program was over. I was very happy to see how nicely the Bologna yatra is growing by the efforts of Trai Prabhu and his wife, Krsnaloka devi dasi. I pray that many people will progress nicely in their Krsna consciousness under their expert care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnfortunately, I do not have any recordings of the talks I gave both evenings but I tried my to give at least a brief summary of the talk which I gave at the public program.

				"value": "<p>\r\n\tIt is with deep regret that I wish to inform devotees that my dear godsister, Isa devi dasi, has left this world. I was just notified today that she departed some time last week. I am greatly lamenting her loss. She was such an amazing soul and a great source of inspiration for me.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did not find out until today because, as I've mentioned before, the nursing home where Mother Isa was being taken care of was not obliged to contact us with any updates about her. By law, only her legal guardian was entitled to get information about her. Therefore devotees had to regularly call the nursing home to get information about her. Syamarupa dasa was told today by an employee at the nursing home that Mother Isa mostlikely departed on March 28th, although that is still unconfirmed. Devotees will need to wait until Monday before they can get the final confirmation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, we should all remember this great soul. I have requested the devotees in Boston to hold a festival in her honor and will be encouraging as many devotees as possible to go there to share their memories of her.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI am reposting the transcription of the lecture I gave in Moscow last year about Mother Isa here. And below you will find the video which Syamarupa dasa took last year of Mother Isa chanting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll glories to Mother Isa, Srila Prabhupada's very dear disciple who perfected her life in his service!!!<br />\r\n\t \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeptember 9, 2012 - Moscow Sunday Feast - About Mother Isa<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThank you all for coming today for our Sunday feast program. Do we have any guest that we are welcoming today for the first time? I see, there are few of you. Welcome. I am very happy that you were able to come today. I am very happy to be here. I am happy that I was able to come today too. Today I am going to speak on a different topic. Actually, it’s not a different topic, but a different type of presentation. As you can see, there is a screen here. We are going to show something towards the end of our presentation. It will be about ten minutes long, and will be related to the topic about which I am going to speak.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGenerally, when Vaishnavas depart from this world, it is quite commonplace for devotees to assemble to hear about the activities the departed Vaishnava performed in this world. But, as I said, today it’s a little bit different, because today we are going to speak about a Vaishnava who has not yet departed. And we don’t know when this Vaishnavi will depart. But one thing is for sure: her life is in Krsna’s hands. This devotee lived in the Boston area for many years. The devotees in Boston want to be prepared, for when this Vaishnavi departs from the world, they want to have as many Vaishnavas throughout the world to share their memories about her. She is truly a very unique soul, as you will hear about her tonight. And I have to be honest and admit that actually this woman is one of my siksa-gurus. I have spoken about her many times, because I often times think about her. I find that the more I think about her, the more I meditate on her life and her example, the more my heart becomes free from lust, envy, and greed. And that’s the type of impact that this Vaishnavi has upon me and has upon many. So obviously, if that experience is there, then there must be something very pure about this person.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd purity is a state of being that we all, at least those who are practitioners of Krsna consciousness, are aspiring for. We have been speaking a lot on this topic, about the necessity to become more pure in heart, to become free from all the bad qualities that are manifested in those conditioned by the laws of nature. Especially we have been speaking a lot about envy and the need to overcome the influence of envy in our lives and in our dealings with others.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, just this morning we were reading from a commentary by Srila Prabhupada in which he was describing two types of envious beings. He said that one envious being is a snake. And he said that a snake could be pacified by mantras or herbs. But he added that when a person is envious, there is nothing that can pacify him. That is the nature of a person whose heart is filled with envy. Of course, we went on to explain that although there is nothing material that can pacify an envious person, it is certain that purity and the association of a devotee of the Lord – especially the association of a devotee whose heart is pure – can eradicate envy even in the heart of the most envious person.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were reading from a verse by Prahlada Maharaja in which he was praying to Lord Nrsimhadeva, “Let all envious persons in this world become pacified by engaging in the process of bhakti-yoga.” And he said, “Because only then one will be able to genuinely think of the welfare of others.” So this was the prayer of Prahlada Maharaja, praying for all living beings in this world, for their hearts to become pure and to become pacified, free from envy, so that they can think of the welfare of others.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs long as there is any trace of envy within the heart, then there are unfulfilled desires. And it is very difficult to think of what is completely beneficial for someone else while one is still thinking about what is beneficial for himself. The whole life of a practitioner of bhakti-yoga is therefore aimed at purification of the heart. The more the heart becomes clean, the more the heart becomes pure, then one becomes satisfied. And a self-satisfied person can actually think of the welfare of others. We oftentimes offer this prayer to Vaishnavas:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tvancha-kalpatarubhyas ca krpa-sindhubhya eva ca patitanam pavanebhyo vaisnavebhyo namo namah<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t“We offer our respectful obeisances unto all the Vaishnava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t When I think of this Vaishnavi and just meditate on her activities, her life, and her example, I feel that my heart becomes free from unwanted things. There are many other people who have a similar experience of her, not only today but as they knew her many, many years ago. Therefore, for my own purification, I would like to speak about her glories. I hope that by so doing it will attract you also to this devotee and make you aspire for what she has achieved in this life by her own purity. An ordinary materialistic person may look at what she has achieved, which I am going to tell you about tonight, and they may not see anything. They may not be able to understand. Although, I am sure even they would appreciate her simplicity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI should probably tell you a little bit more about this person, so that you can have a better understanding of why I am speaking about her. She is my God-sister, an initiated disciple of His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada. Her name is Isa Devi Dasi. Isa is presently ninety-five years old. She joined the Krsna consciousness movement when she was fifty-five. At that time in the early 1970s most people who joined the Krsna consciousness movement were less than half her age. It was very rare for a person her age to join the movement, move into the temple, and engage in full-time devotional service. What to speak of how extraordinary it was for her to live with young people – to associate with and serve with them. She was like a mother to everybody. It was not easy for her to live under those circumstances. She didn’t have to live in a temple. But she wanted to live in the temple, because she wanted to dedicate her whole life to the service of Srila Prabhupada.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the early 1970s she was living in our New York temple. At that time the BBT, the Bhaktivedanta book Trust, was not yet actually established. It used to be called ISKCON Press. Everything was right there in New York – all the pre-press work, even the printing, the storage for Prabhupada’s books – everything was right there in New York.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIsa’s service was transcription. She would get Prabhupada’s translations and commentaries on tape, and she would be the first person to listen to them and transcribe them. In fact there was a picture of her in our “Back to Godhead” magazine in 1974. She is sitting with her usual bright effulgent smile, and she has huge headphones on, and she is typing as she is listening to Prabhupada’s words. That was her service for some time. But then a little bit later ISKCON Press moved out to Los Angeles. Everything moved and became the “Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,” but Isa didn’t go.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor some time she was sent to India, where she was serving in our Bombay temple, taking care of Tulasi-devi. I didn’t know Mother Isa at this time. She had been in New York, when I was in Boston. And then, when she went to India…Our paths just didn’t cross. But I finally got to know her when I was the temple president in Boston. I became temple president in 1979. At that time she no longer actually lived in the temple. She lived about a 100 kilometers south of Boston.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was difficult for her to live in the temple. Her body was getting older. The temple couldn’t provide for her personal needs. Because she had a place to live south of Boston, she decided to move there, where she lived alone. She had been previously married to a man who was actually a well-known professor of mathematics in one of the universities in Massachusetts. But he had already died and they had no children. And she was living alone for the latter part of her life. But she would very frequently come to the temple – as much as she possibly could. She would come and do service in the temple. As I said, I was temple president at that time. She would oftentimes come to the temple and she would report to me. She would tell me about what she was doing at home, and she would tell me about her preaching.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne thing Mother Isa always did, and this is the most wonderful quality about her, she wouldn’t speak about anything except Krsna and Prabhupada. I never heard her speak a word of nonsense. I never heard her speak about others in a critical way. Actually, one time she did say something to me about someone else. She said, “I am concerned; he seems to be in maya.” But that was the only thing I ever heard her say about somebody else. She used to come to my office quite frequently. Whenever she would come to Boston, she reported to me. As soon as she entered the temple, if any guests were there, she would immediately start preaching to them. Her preaching was very simple – very simple, but very pure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe would always carry Hare Krsna mantra cards in her pockets. Whenever she met anybody, she would immediately say, “Can you sing this with me?” She was an elderly woman, so she commanded some respect. So, she did that in the temple, but as I later found out, she did it wherever she was living, wherever she went. She was always carrying some books, some pamphlets, some mantra cards, and she was always approaching people, saying, “Please, sing this with me.” And then: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then she would look at them and say, “Can you sing it yourself?” People were just so disarmed. They could not say anything…just “Hare Krsna…” They would just chant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe especially used to come on Sunday, when all the guests come. If she were here right now, she would probably come to each of you who are here for the first time. She would hand you a card and say, “Chant with me.” Whoever she approached, everybody chanted. That is the way she was.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe didn’t have any time to talk about anything else. Her preaching was always very, very simple – but profound. She would say, “Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can do anything, because He is the Supreme Lord. If you take shelter of Him, He can do anything. Whatever you need, He can take care of.” She was speaking from her own realization. It was not pretentious. This was her realization because it was very difficult for her to live alone. She did not have much money; she lived very, very simply. She went through many difficulties in her life. She lost many family members.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe had one brother, who was older than her. She used to have to take care of him, and he was very antagonistic. She used to come to the temple and tell me, “That brother of mine, he won’t chant Hare Krsna.” That was her problem: her brother wouldn’t chant Hare Krsna. She also had a niece that was very antagonistic. But she never wanted to accept any help from her family members. She wanted to depend on Krsna.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe was living in a city called Hyannis on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. She was effectively the main preacher there. She would always go introducing people to Prabhupada’s books. Everywhere she went she had Prabhupada’s books. She would ride around town on a bicycle. That is how she got everywhere. Whenever she would go into a store to buy something, she would always have some of Prabhupada’s books and some mantra cards. And everyone she met she would always give them books and preach to them. Gradually some people became attracted to her and they wanted to learn more about Prabhupada and Krsna. Whenever there was a group of people that she had been introducing to Krsna consciousness, she would invite me, “Please come down and give a lecture to these people.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo I used to go down; not that regularly, but once every few months we would go down and have a program. Isa would introduce to me all the people she had met in the course of her travels. Her preaching was just always the same. “Krsna is God. Krsna can do anything. Just take shelter of Him and chant these names.” It was not very complicated. She did not give lectures or anything like that. She just spoke, and then exemplified what she said. That was her life. That is all I know of her life. It was her life just to take shelter of the holy name, to preach the glories of the holy name, and to preach the glories of Prabhupada. She definitely was very much attracted to always speaking about Prabhupada.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer life went on like this for quite a few years. And she continued to come to the temple very regularly – every Sunday. She oftentimes would sew. She liked to sew, so she would sew things for devotees and for the Deities. She liked to make Prabhupada’s hats, because she always saw these hats on Prabhupada in his pictures. When she saw Prabhupada in person, he was wearing his famous “Prabhupada hat” that he would tie under his chin. Every week she came, she would always bring these hats for the brahmacaris and the other devotees in the temple. And bead bags – she liked to make bead bags. Nobody could refuse. Everybody was wearing Prabhupada hats in the temple. She was the kind of woman you just can’t refuse. If she asked you to take a hat, you had to take it and immediately put it on. She would just immediately smile; it made her so happy. She was so happy, because she was so grateful she could do some service for the devotees. That was her life – just doing some service according to her means. She wanted to serve the devotees and to serve Radha-Gopivallabha, the Radha-Krsna Deities in Boston.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs soon as she came into the temple, She would report to me, telling me about her preaching. Then she would immediately go to shower, put on clean clothes, and go down to the pujari room to iron all the Deities’ clothes. She would iron handkerchiefs, and she would iron the Deity’s cadars and clothes. She would stay in the pujari room until the Sunday feast program was about to start, and then she would go out and preach to the guests. She would preach to the guests all the time during the Sunday program. She would only take a little prasada; she never ate the feast, because she was so busy preaching. She would just honor a little maha-prasada, because she wanted to serve to her full capacity while she was in the temple. Then she would go home. She would take a bus 100 km home late at night every Sunday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom time to time, she would come during the week, but mostly she came on Sundays. She just continued doing this for so many years. She never complained. I never heard a complaint from this woman’s mouth. She was so happy just to have Prabhupada and Krsna, to be able to associate with the devotees. It was her life. Sometimes people think that when you live away from the devotees, it is very difficult to stay in Krsna consciousness: so many distractions, so many allurements. Sometimes people lament that, “I need to live closer to the devotees.” But she was self-satisfied, and she went on like that for many years. I started travelling on this side of the world many years ago, and so I didn‘t see her so often. But I always used to inquire about her. Because I knew her, I knew she was living far away.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs the years went by, not many devotees in the temple knew her, especially when it became too difficult for her to come to the temple. But I didn’t want anybody to forget that she exists. So I would always either send an email or call, or whenever I came I would say, “Where is Mother Isa? How is she doing?” And I would hear, “Oh, Mother Isa? We haven’t seen her for a long time.” She was already in her eighties at that time. I would say, “What do you mean you haven’t seen her for a long time? What kind of an answer is that? That’s not an answer. I haven’t seen her for a long time. Do you know why you haven’t seen her for a long time?” I always had the biggest fear in my heart that this woman might leave the planet and nobody would know about it. It was always a fear in my heart. It would be a travesty: such an exalted Vaishnavi leaves and nobody knows. So I used to make the devotees find out where was Mother Isa. And they did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe was getting too old to make the bus trip to Boston. But she was still doing whatever she could. She was no longer on a bicycle, but she was still going places, meeting people and introducing them to Krsna consciousness. Actually, it got to the point where it was very difficult for her even to do her basic shopping. She had met one woman in a health food store. Isa was preaching to this woman because she worked in a health food store that Isa would go to quite regularly. Isa would always give her books and preach to her. So, the woman wanted to find out more about Isa, because she was very attracted to Isa. She gradually found out that Isa was living alone, that she was a devotee, a disciple of Srila Prabhupada, and that all she would talk about was Krsna and Prabhupada. This woman began to feel like she wanted to do some service for Mother Isa. She started buying Mother Isa’s food, so that she would not have to go out. This woman was taking care of all Isa’s personal needs. She was so drawn to Isa that she couldn’t help but serve her. I didn’t know about this. But I found out about it in 2006. In 2006 this woman – she is probably now in her late thirties, maybe forty years old – she called the Boston temple and left a message on the answering machine. She said, “I don’t know if this is the right number to call or not, but I wanted to tell you that there is a woman here in Hyannis, her name is Isa Devi Dasi. She just had a stroke, and she is in a hospital. I thought you may be interested to hear this.” That was the message. She also left her name and phone number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnfortunately, at that time nobody in the temple knew who Isa was. But, fortunately, I was in America at the same time, so I called the temple, and somebody in the temple said, “Somebody left a message about some Isa Devi Dasi who just had a stroke.” I said, “Isa had a stroke? What’s wrong? Where is she? What happened?” – “We don’t know anything about it.” Immediately, I said, “Did they leave a number?” – “Yes, they left the number.” So, I immediately called, and Sandy - she introduced herself – told me about everything that had happened. She said that Isa had had a stroke and was in the hospital. Sandy had found Isa at the bottom of the stairs, where she was lying unconscious. She said that Isa was currently in the hospital, that she was not conscious, but that the doctors were hopeful she would regain consciousness soon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs it turned out, she did regain consciousness very soon. But the result of having had the stroke was that the doctors found out that was one of many strokes she had had. The doctors said that Isa must have had at least five or six strokes before that one. That particular stroke completely took away her memory. She didn‘t know who she was; she didn‘t know her name; she didn‘t know where she lived; she didn‘t remember anybody; though, Sandy said, she claimed she remembered me. She also remembered one other devotee – his name was Damodara – who also used to serve together with her in the Boston temple. I asked Sandy, “Where is she? Can I come and see her?” She said, “It will be better to come see her when she is brought to the rehabilitation hospital. She will be transferred there in two days.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, in two days I called to see if Sandy was there and if I could meet her and see Isa. Sandy was right there in the room with Isa at that time. She answered the phone. I introduced myself, and she said to Isa, “Isa, it’s Niranjana Swami. Do you remember Niranjana Swami?” Isa didn’t really respond. She gave the phone to Isa and said, “Isa, say something to Niranjana Swami.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t“Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna, Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. All glories to Srila Prabhupada!” That’s what she said. And then she handed the phone back to Sandy. She was singing just like that, in that melody, and with great enthusiasm. I said to Sandy, “It sounds like she hasn’t lost all her memory.” But Sandy said, “It seems to be that’s all she remembers.” So I said, “It can’t be all that bad.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI went that day to visit her with another devotee. She was there at a rehabilitation hospital, and the doctors were teaching her how to eat – because she forgot how to eat – teaching her how to dress, how to walk – she forgot how to walk. She couldn’t remember any of these things. She had no memory of anything. We waited for some time while she was in therapy. And then finally she was wheeled into the room where we were waiting for her. She had this very intense stare; she was looking at me. I started talking to Mother Isa, “Hare Krsna. How are you?” She couldn’t say much.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt one point we were sitting and talking to her, we were trying to bring back her memory. One of the nurses came over to Isa, because when you forget, one of the things to do is to try to stimulate a person‘s memory. So she sat down in front of Isa – her name is Edith – and she said, “Edith, where do you live? Where is your home, Edith?” And Isa says, “My home? In a very slow, deliberate, but innocent way, she said the word, \"Vrindavan.” The nurse couldn‘t understand. She said something like, “I think she said Chicago.” Isa said, “No. Vrindavan is my home.” That was one thing that really caught my attention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen we were sitting and talking to Isa. She wasn‘t really responding so much. Sandy was sitting at the table and we were mostly talking to Sandy, because Isa wasn‘t responding so much. Sandy was telling us the story about how she got to know Isa. She told us how Isa came and preached to her in the health food store, how she started serving Isa, and how she was in a conflict with her husband because she was serving Isa more than she was serving the family. I said, “You’re doing a lot of service. You must be a devotee.” She said, “A devotee? I don‘t know what a devotee is. All I know is she talks about Krsna.” And she said, “All I know is, I love Isa. And if loving Isa means I am a devotee, then I am a devotee.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI could see that this woman’s heart was really being transformed by associating with Isa. She was just so dedicated to serving her. She was already making plans, how they could add on to her home so that when Isa got out from the rehabilitation hospital Isa could move in with them so that she could take care of her. They weren‘t a very wealthy family, but she was ready to do anything for Isa. Still, the husband he was a little reluctant. And it turned out that the husband started putting up some resistance…<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe best part is yet to come. This is leading up to the best part. Do you want me to end? &lt;Devotees say no&gt; Ok, I‘ll continue. And I‘ll try to not keep you too long from your feast. But don‘t forget, Mother Isa would fast. She wouldn‘t be so much concerned about the feast. She only wanted to hear and chant about Krsna.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it was a problem. The husband didn‘t want Isa to move into their home. Sandy was explaining all this to us. All of a sudden another nurse walked over to the table, and Isa looked up and she sternly asked, “Are you a vegetarian?” And Sandy started clapping, “That‘s the Isa I know.” She was so happy. Immediately she said, “Isa is coming back. That‘s the Isa I know. She is always preaching.” Meanwhile, the nurse was just startled. She didn‘t know what to say. She said, “Well, I try not to eat red meat.” Isa wasn‘t satisfied. She just gave a dirty look, but she didn‘t say anything more. Damodara had to explain to her about the benefits of being vegetarian. The woman left, saying, “Well, I am going to think seriously about becoming vegetarian now.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we went back into Isa‘s room, and there was another devotee…Actually, this was another visit, not the same visit. Isa was already in the room when I came with another devotee. Isa was staring at this devotee as he was chanting japa; she was staring at his bead bag. I asked Sandy, “Where are her beads? Does she have beads?” Sandy said, “Actually, no. Her beads broke when she fell down the stairs during her stroke. She has no beads.” She said, “But my husband is restringing them for her.” But Mother Isa was still looking at the bead bag. Although we were trying to get her to communicate, she just wouldn‘t take her eyes away from the bead bag. So the devotee, Yamuna Jivana, gave his bead bag to Isa. Isa looked like a little child who had just received a Christmas present she had been waiting for all year. She put her hand into the bead bag immediately and just started chanting, “Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna…” She didn‘t notice anything else that was going on in the room. She just stayed that way for the whole rest of the visit, just chanting japa, as if she had been waiting such a long time for those beads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnfortunately, that was the last time I saw Isa until just two weeks ago. But I arranged for a whole group of devotees to rotate and go visit her from time to time. After a while I found out they were becoming a little negligent, and nobody was visiting her. So, just on my last trip to the United States I took two other devotees with me, and we went down to the nursing home where she is now. We tried very hard to find a way that Mother Isa could live with devotees, so that devotees could take care of her. But it was very, very difficult. I knew that Mother Isa had some funds, because one time she called me and asked for my name – she wanted to put my name into her will so that all her money would be given to me when she died.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, I asked Sandy, because Sandy took responsibility for her accounts also, how much money was available? Maybe we could build a house in one of the farm communities, and the devotees could take care of her. Unfortunately, it wasn‘t very much. But, even worse, her niece refused to let her be taken away. Her niece had full custody of Isa, because she was the only living relative. They wouldn‘t let us take her to any place far from where she had been living.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe went to the nursing home. I hadn‘t seen Mother Isa for five or six years. She was wheeled into the room. I could see that she was a lot older. When I talked to her she was a lot less responsive. Her memory was practically completely gone. When I would talk to her, I would say, “Isa, tell me something about Prabhupada. Tell me something about Krsna.” She would just look at me very intensely – in the eyes – but she couldn‘t say anything. So, I decided to go to the nurses’ station to ask them if they could tell me about her current state. I told them who I was and how I had known her for almost forty years. I was told at the nurses’ station that actually the morning is a very bad time of day to get her to respond because she is very, very tired. The nurse said, “But if you come during the day, she‘ll sing the Krsna song for you.” I said, “Oh, really?” Immediately I became enlivened, because I knew she was still chanting. I couldn‘t imagine Mother Isa not chanting Hare Krsna. So, I went back into the room again and I reached out for her hand, and she immediately grabbed my hand very tightly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI said, “Mother Isa, Hare Krsna.” And she looked at me and said, “Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna…” She chanted the whole mantra all the way through. She did this for several minutes. But we couldn‘t get her to say anything else but the maha-mantra. That‘s all she could say. We could see that she was very tired, so we decided after forty-five minutes that we would leave and try to come back some time in the afternoon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we were leaving the nursing home, one of the nurses saw me out of the corner of her eye – I was dressed in my robes – she was helping a group of elderly people to get into a van. She came over to me and said, “Who are you here to see?” So I said, “I am here to see Edith Graves.” She said, “I knew it. I love that woman. Everybody in this whole building loves that woman. She‘s the most peaceful person, so self contented. She never complains. Every Friday we get together and we sing patriotic songs together. And she leads everybody in a Krsna song.” The whole group of people, she just starts leading them in kirtana. She just chants Hare Krsna, and everybody just follows along and chants with her.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere was another elderly woman in a wheelchair. She was being wheeled onto the van. She immediately put her hand out and she said, “Very nice to meet you. My name is Kay. I love that woman too. That woman is a real live wire. When she starts chanting that Krsna song with such enthusiasm, everybody just has to chant. Everybody has to sing with her. Tell me, how old is she? Nobody knows how old she is.” I said, “She is ninety-five years old.” She said, “Oh.” Maybe she became very reverential when she heard that Isa was ninety-five years old. She begged us, “Please come back again.” And the other nurse said, “Please come back. You have to come and see her. Nobody has been visiting her.” So I thanked them profusely, and I told them, “Thank you for sharing these stories about Isa with me. It means so much to me. We‘ll definitely come back.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the devotee that came with me, it just so happened that he had to be near there on that Friday afternoon. So I told him, “You have to take a camera. I want you to take a video of Mother Isa chanting. Then you should interview everybody and ask them what they think about her.” As it turned out, there was a strict policy in the nursing home not to allow events to be videotaped. They obviously don’t allow anybody to go around and interview people on video. But this devotee took some video clips of Mother Isa chanting. She can‘t say anything from memory, except the Hare Krsna mantra. Sometimes she may repeat a word or two, but it‘s just repetition. But as soon she starts with the Hare Krsna mantra, it just comes out with such enthusiasm, with such devotion – it‘s profound.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI’m thinking that Krsna has taken away everything, but she has everything she needs for a perfect life. She doesn‘t have to think about her body, she doesn‘t complain about anything, she doesn‘t have to think about anything, because the only thing she can think about is the holy name. It‘s the only thing that comes out of her mouth. I tried to get something else, but nothing else would come, just the Holy name. So, I’m thinking that Krsna, who is in the heart, has actually rewarded her for a life of only speaking about Krsna.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI wrote the story and I put it on the internet, and devotees are writing back and leaving little comments. Sivarama Maharaja says, “If having a stroke means that all I’ll be able to say is Hare Krsna, then maybe I should have a stroke.” Other devotees are writing things like this, “Wonderful! It‘s amazing! All glories to Prabhupada! This is shocking!”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow we are going to show this video. It‘s ten minutes. But I want you to take note what she does when the woman who is with her tries to get her to chant. When she chants, the woman and Syamarupa both say, “That‘s wonderful, Mother Isa.” Watch the expression on her face when they say, “That‘s wonderful, Mother Isa.” It‘s the same expression she would always show when everybody would try to glorify her. Because she never wanted glorification. She would always think nothing of it. She didn’t want to hear it. So when you hear, “That’s wonderful,” watch her expression. The other thing…towards the end you‘ll see such an effulgent smile. It will melt your heart. For me, it brings tears to my eyes, because she is my siksa-guru. She has always been an object of my meditation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, I’d like to introduce you to Mother Isa. Hare Krsna. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xP3hyLKXHxc?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n",

I was just notified today that she departed some time last week. I am greatly lamenting her loss. She was such an amazing soul and a great source of inspiration for me.</p>\n<p>\tWe did not find out until today because, as I've mentioned before, the nursing home where Mother Isa was being taken care of was not obliged to contact us with any updates about her. By law, only her legal guardian was entitled to get information about her. Therefore devotees had to regularly call the nursing home to get information about her. Syamarupa dasa was told today by an employee at the nursing home that Mother Isa mostlikely departed on March 28th, although that is still unconfirmed. Devotees will need to wait until Monday before they can get the final confirmation.</p>\n<p>\tMeanwhile, we should all remember this great soul. I have requested the devotees in Boston to hold a festival in her honor and will be encouraging as many devotees as possible to go there to share their memories of her.</p>\n<p>\tI am reposting the transcription of the lecture I gave in Moscow last year about Mother Isa here. And below you will find the video which Syamarupa dasa took last year of Mother Isa chanting.</p>\n<p>\tAll glories to Mother Isa, Srila Prabhupada's very dear disciple who perfected her life in his service!!!</p>\n<p>\n\tSeptember 9, 2012 - Moscow Sunday Feast - About Mother Isa</p>\n<p>\tThank you all for coming today for our Sunday feast program. Do we have any guest that we are welcoming today for the first time? I see, there are few of you. Welcome. I am very happy that you were able to come today. I am very happy to be here. I am happy that I was able to come today too. Today I am going to speak on a different topic. Actually, it’s not a different topic, but a different type of presentation. As you can see, there is a screen here. We are going to show something towards the end of our presentation. It will be about ten minutes long, and will be related to the topic about which I am going to speak.</p>\n<p>\tGenerally, when Vaishnavas depart from this world, it is quite commonplace for devotees to assemble to hear about the activities the departed Vaishnava performed in this world. But, as I said, today it’s a little bit different, because today we are going to speak about a Vaishnava who has not yet departed. And we don’t know when this Vaishnavi will depart. But one thing is for sure: her life is in Krsna’s hands. This devotee lived in the Boston area for many years. The devotees in Boston want to be prepared, for when this Vaishnavi departs from the world, they want to have as many Vaishnavas throughout the world to share their memories about her. She is truly a very unique soul, as you will hear about her tonight. And I have to be honest and admit that actually this woman is one of my siksa-gurus. I have spoken about her many times, because I often times think about her. I find that the more I think about her, the more I meditate on her life and her example, the more my heart becomes free from lust, envy, and greed. And that’s the type of impact that this Vaishnavi has upon me and has upon many. So obviously, if that experience is there, then there must be something very pure about this person.</p>\n<p>\tAnd purity is a state of being that we all, at least those who are practitioners of Krsna consciousness, are aspiring for. We have been speaking a lot on this topic, about the necessity to become more pure in heart, to become free from all the bad qualities that are manifested in those conditioned by the laws of nature. Especially we have been speaking a lot about envy and the need to overcome the influence of envy in our lives and in our dealings with others.</p>\n<p>\tIn fact, just this morning we were reading from a commentary by Srila Prabhupada in which he was describing two types of envious beings. He said that one envious being is a snake. And he said that a snake could be pacified by mantras or herbs. But he added that when a person is envious, there is nothing that can pacify him. That is the nature of a person whose heart is filled with envy. Of course, we went on to explain that although there is nothing material that can pacify an envious person, it is certain that purity and the association of a devotee of the Lord – especially the association of a devotee whose heart is pure – can eradicate envy even in the heart of the most envious person.</p>\n<p>\tWe were reading from a verse by Prahlada Maharaja in which he was praying to Lord Nrsimhadeva, “Let all envious persons in this world become pacified by engaging in the process of bhakti-yoga.” And he said, “Because only then one will be able to genuinely think of the welfare of others.” So this was the prayer of Prahlada Maharaja, praying for all living beings in this world, for their hearts to become pure and to become pacified, free from envy, so that they can think of the welfare of others.</p>\n<p>\tAs long as there is any trace of envy within the heart, then there are unfulfilled desires. And it is very difficult to think of what is completely beneficial for someone else while one is still thinking about what is beneficial for himself. The whole life of a practitioner of bhakti-yoga is therefore aimed at purification of the heart. The more the heart becomes clean, the more the heart becomes pure, then one becomes satisfied. And a self-satisfied person can actually think of the welfare of others. We oftentimes offer this prayer to Vaishnavas:</p>\n<p>\tvancha-kalpatarubhyas ca krpa-sindhubhya eva ca patitanam pavanebhyo vaisnavebhyo namo namah</p>\n<p>\t“We offer our respectful obeisances unto all the Vaishnava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls.”</p>\n<p>\t When I think of this Vaishnavi and just meditate on her activities, her life, and her example, I feel that my heart becomes free from unwanted things. There are many other people who have a similar experience of her, not only today but as they knew her many, many years ago. Therefore, for my own purification, I would like to speak about her glories. I hope that by so doing it will attract you also to this devotee and make you aspire for what she has achieved in this life by her own purity. An ordinary materialistic person may look at what she has achieved, which I am going to tell you about tonight, and they may not see anything. They may not be able to understand. Although, I am sure even they would appreciate her simplicity.</p>\n<p>\tI should probably tell you a little bit more about this person, so that you can have a better understanding of why I am speaking about her. She is my God-sister, an initiated disciple of His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada. Her name is Isa Devi Dasi. Isa is presently ninety-five years old. She joined the Krsna consciousness movement when she was fifty-five. At that time in the early 1970s most people who joined the Krsna consciousness movement were less than half her age. It was very rare for a person her age to join the movement, move into the temple, and engage in full-time devotional service. What to speak of how extraordinary it was for her to live with young people – to associate with and serve with them. She was like a mother to everybody. It was not easy for her to live under those circumstances. She didn’t have to live in a temple. But she wanted to live in the temple, because she wanted to dedicate her whole life to the service of Srila Prabhupada.</p>\n<p>\tIn the early 1970s she was living in our New York temple. At that time the BBT, the Bhaktivedanta book Trust, was not yet actually established. It used to be called ISKCON Press. Everything was right there in New York – all the pre-press work, even the printing, the storage for Prabhupada’s books – everything was right there in New York.</p>\n<p>\tIsa’s service was transcription. She would get Prabhupada’s translations and commentaries on tape, and she would be the first person to listen to them and transcribe them. In fact there was a picture of her in our “Back to Godhead” magazine in 1974. She is sitting with her usual bright effulgent smile, and she has huge headphones on, and she is typing as she is listening to Prabhupada’s words. That was her service for some time. But then a little bit later ISKCON Press moved out to Los Angeles. Everything moved and became the “Bhaktivedanta Book Trust,” but Isa didn’t go.</p>\n<p>\tFor some time she was sent to India, where she was serving in our Bombay temple, taking care of Tulasi-devi. I didn’t know Mother Isa at this time. She had been in New York, when I was in Boston. And then, when she went to India…Our paths just didn’t cross. But I finally got to know her when I was the temple president in Boston. I became temple president in 1979. At that time she no longer actually lived in the temple. She lived about a 100 kilometers south of Boston.</p>\n<p>\tIt was difficult for her to live in the temple. Her body was getting older. The temple couldn’t provide for her personal needs. Because she had a place to live south of Boston, she decided to move there, where she lived alone. She had been previously married to a man who was actually a well-known professor of mathematics in one of the universities in Massachusetts. But he had already died and they had no children. And she was living alone for the latter part of her life. But she would very frequently come to the temple – as much as she possibly could. She would come and do service in the temple. As I said, I was temple president at that time. She would oftentimes come to the temple and she would report to me. She would tell me about what she was doing at home, and she would tell me about her preaching.</p>\n<p>\tOne thing Mother Isa always did, and this is the most wonderful quality about her, she wouldn’t speak about anything except Krsna and Prabhupada. I never heard her speak a word of nonsense. I never heard her speak about others in a critical way. Actually, one time she did say something to me about someone else. She said, “I am concerned; he seems to be in maya.” But that was the only thing I ever heard her say about somebody else. She used to come to my office quite frequently. Whenever she would come to Boston, she reported to me. As soon as she entered the temple, if any guests were there, she would immediately start preaching to them. Her preaching was very simple – very simple, but very pure.</p>\n<p>\tShe would always carry Hare Krsna mantra cards in her pockets. Whenever she met anybody, she would immediately say, “Can you sing this with me?” She was an elderly woman, so she commanded some respect. So, she did that in the temple, but as I later found out, she did it wherever she was living, wherever she went. She was always carrying some books, some pamphlets, some mantra cards, and she was always approaching people, saying, “Please, sing this with me.” And then: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then she would look at them and say, “Can you sing it yourself?” People were just so disarmed. They could not say anything…just “Hare Krsna…” They would just chant.</p>\n<p>\tShe especially used to come on Sunday, when all the guests come. If she were here right now, she would probably come to each of you who are here for the first time. She would hand you a card and say, “Chant with me.” Whoever she approached, everybody chanted. That is the way she was.</p>\n<p>\tShe didn’t have any time to talk about anything else. Her preaching was always very, very simple – but profound. She would say, “Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can do anything, because He is the Supreme Lord. If you take shelter of Him, He can do anything. Whatever you need, He can take care of.” She was speaking from her own realization. It was not pretentious. This was her realization because it was very difficult for her to live alone. She did not have much money; she lived very, very simply. She went through many difficulties in her life. She lost many family members.</p>\n<p>\tShe had one brother, who was older than her. She used to have to take care of him, and he was very antagonistic. She used to come to the temple and tell me, “That brother of mine, he won’t chant Hare Krsna.” That was her problem: her brother wouldn’t chant Hare Krsna. She also had a niece that was very antagonistic. But she never wanted to accept any help from her family members. She wanted to depend on Krsna.</p>\n<p>\tShe was living in a city called Hyannis on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. She was effectively the main preacher there. She would always go introducing people to Prabhupada’s books. Everywhere she went she had Prabhupada’s books. She would ride around town on a bicycle. That is how she got everywhere. Whenever she would go into a store to buy something, she would always have some of Prabhupada’s books and some mantra cards. And everyone she met she would always give them books and preach to them. Gradually some people became attracted to her and they wanted to learn more about Prabhupada and Krsna. Whenever there was a group of people that she had been introducing to Krsna consciousness, she would invite me, “Please come down and give a lecture to these people.”</p>\n<p>\tSo I used to go down; not that regularly, but once every few months we would go down and have a program. Isa would introduce to me all the people she had met in the course of her travels. Her preaching was just always the same. “Krsna is God. Krsna can do anything. Just take shelter of Him and chant these names.” It was not very complicated. She did not give lectures or anything like that. She just spoke, and then exemplified what she said. That was her life. That is all I know of her life. It was her life just to take shelter of the holy name, to preach the glories of the holy name, and to preach the glories of Prabhupada. She definitely was very much attracted to always speaking about Prabhupada.</p>\n<p>\tHer life went on like this for quite a few years. And she continued to come to the temple very regularly – every Sunday. She oftentimes would sew. She liked to sew, so she would sew things for devotees and for the Deities. She liked to make Prabhupada’s hats, because she always saw these hats on Prabhupada in his pictures. When she saw Prabhupada in person, he was wearing his famous “Prabhupada hat” that he would tie under his chin. Every week she came, she would always bring these hats for the brahmacaris and the other devotees in the temple. And bead bags – she liked to make bead bags. Nobody could refuse. Everybody was wearing Prabhupada hats in the temple. She was the kind of woman you just can’t refuse. If she asked you to take a hat, you had to take it and immediately put it on. She would just immediately smile; it made her so happy. She was so happy, because she was so grateful she could do some service for the devotees. That was her life – just doing some service according to her means. She wanted to serve the devotees and to serve Radha-Gopivallabha, the Radha-Krsna Deities in Boston.</p>\n<p>\tAs soon as she came into the temple, She would report to me, telling me about her preaching. Then she would immediately go to shower, put on clean clothes, and go down to the pujari room to iron all the Deities’ clothes. She would iron handkerchiefs, and she would iron the Deity’s cadars and clothes. She would stay in the pujari room until the Sunday feast program was about to start, and then she would go out and preach to the guests. She would preach to the guests all the time during the Sunday program. She would only take a little prasada; she never ate the feast, because she was so busy preaching. She would just honor a little maha-prasada, because she wanted to serve to her full capacity while she was in the temple. Then she would go home. She would take a bus 100 km home late at night every Sunday.</p>\n<p>\tFrom time to time, she would come during the week, but mostly she came on Sundays. She just continued doing this for so many years. She never complained. I never heard a complaint from this woman’s mouth. She was so happy just to have Prabhupada and Krsna, to be able to associate with the devotees. It was her life. Sometimes people think that when you live away from the devotees, it is very difficult to stay in Krsna consciousness: so many distractions, so many allurements. Sometimes people lament that, “I need to live closer to the devotees.” But she was self-satisfied, and she went on like that for many years. I started travelling on this side of the world many years ago, and so I didn‘t see her so often. But I always used to inquire about her. Because I knew her, I knew she was living far away.</p>\n<p>\tAs the years went by, not many devotees in the temple knew her, especially when it became too difficult for her to come to the temple. But I didn’t want anybody to forget that she exists. So I would always either send an email or call, or whenever I came I would say, “Where is Mother Isa? How is she doing?” And I would hear, “Oh, Mother Isa? We haven’t seen her for a long time.” She was already in her eighties at that time. I would say, “What do you mean you haven’t seen her for a long time? What kind of an answer is that? That’s not an answer. I haven’t seen her for a long time. Do you know why you haven’t seen her for a long time?” I always had the biggest fear in my heart that this woman might leave the planet and nobody would know about it. It was always a fear in my heart. It would be a travesty: such an exalted Vaishnavi leaves and nobody knows. So I used to make the devotees find out where was Mother Isa. And they did.</p>\n<p>\tShe was getting too old to make the bus trip to Boston. But she was still doing whatever she could. She was no longer on a bicycle, but she was still going places, meeting people and introducing them to Krsna consciousness. Actually, it got to the point where it was very difficult for her even to do her basic shopping. She had met one woman in a health food store. Isa was preaching to this woman because she worked in a health food store that Isa would go to quite regularly. Isa would always give her books and preach to her. So, the woman wanted to find out more about Isa, because she was very attracted to Isa. She gradually found out that Isa was living alone, that she was a devotee, a disciple of Srila Prabhupada, and that all she would talk about was Krsna and Prabhupada. This woman began to feel like she wanted to do some service for Mother Isa. She started buying Mother Isa’s food, so that she would not have to go out. This woman was taking care of all Isa’s personal needs. She was so drawn to Isa that she couldn’t help but serve her. I didn’t know about this. But I found out about it in 2006. In 2006 this woman – she is probably now in her late thirties, maybe forty years old – she called the Boston temple and left a message on the answering machine. She said, “I don’t know if this is the right number to call or not, but I wanted to tell you that there is a woman here in Hyannis, her name is Isa Devi Dasi. She just had a stroke, and she is in a hospital. I thought you may be interested to hear this.” That was the message. She also left her name and phone number.</p>\n<p>\tUnfortunately, at that time nobody in the temple knew who Isa was. But, fortunately, I was in America at the same time, so I called the temple, and somebody in the temple said, “Somebody left a message about some Isa Devi Dasi who just had a stroke.” I said, “Isa had a stroke? What’s wrong? Where is she? What happened?” – “We don’t know anything about it.” Immediately, I said, “Did they leave a number?” – “Yes, they left the number.” So, I immediately called, and Sandy - she introduced herself – told me about everything that had happened. She said that Isa had had a stroke and was in the hospital. Sandy had found Isa at the bottom of the stairs, where she was lying unconscious. She said that Isa was currently in the hospital, that she was not conscious, but that the doctors were hopeful she would regain consciousness soon.</p>\n<p>\tAs it turned out, she did regain consciousness very soon. But the result of having had the stroke was that the doctors found out that was one of many strokes she had had. The doctors said that Isa must have had at least five or six strokes before that one. That particular stroke completely took away her memory. She didn‘t know who she was; she didn‘t know her name; she didn‘t know where she lived; she didn‘t remember anybody; though, Sandy said, she claimed she remembered me. She also remembered one other devotee – his name was Damodara – who also used to serve together with her in the Boston temple. I asked Sandy, “Where is she? Can I come and see her?” She said, “It will be better to come see her when she is brought to the rehabilitation hospital. She will be transferred there in two days.”</p>\n<p>\tSo, in two days I called to see if Sandy was there and if I could meet her and see Isa. Sandy was right there in the room with Isa at that time. She answered the phone. I introduced myself, and she said to Isa, “Isa, it’s Niranjana Swami. Do you remember Niranjana Swami?” Isa didn’t really respond. She gave the phone to Isa and said, “Isa, say something to Niranjana Swami.”</p>\n<p>\t“Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna, Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. All glories to Srila Prabhupada!” That’s what she said. And then she handed the phone back to Sandy. She was singing just like that, in that melody, and with great enthusiasm. I said to Sandy, “It sounds like she hasn’t lost all her memory.” But Sandy said, “It seems to be that’s all she remembers.” So I said, “It can’t be all that bad.”</p>\n<p>\tI went that day to visit her with another devotee. She was there at a rehabilitation hospital, and the doctors were teaching her how to eat – because she forgot how to eat – teaching her how to dress, how to walk – she forgot how to walk. She couldn’t remember any of these things. She had no memory of anything. We waited for some time while she was in therapy. And then finally she was wheeled into the room where we were waiting for her. She had this very intense stare; she was looking at me. I started talking to Mother Isa, “Hare Krsna. How are you?” She couldn’t say much.</p>\n<p>\tAt one point we were sitting and talking to her, we were trying to bring back her memory. One of the nurses came over to Isa, because when you forget, one of the things to do is to try to stimulate a person‘s memory. So she sat down in front of Isa – her name is Edith – and she said, “Edith, where do you live? Where is your home, Edith?” And Isa says, “My home? In a very slow, deliberate, but innocent way, she said the word, \"Vrindavan.” The nurse couldn‘t understand. She said something like, “I think she said Chicago.” Isa said, “No. Vrindavan is my home.” That was one thing that really caught my attention.</p>\n<p>\tThen we were sitting and talking to Isa. She wasn‘t really responding so much. Sandy was sitting at the table and we were mostly talking to Sandy, because Isa wasn‘t responding so much. Sandy was telling us the story about how she got to know Isa. She told us how Isa came and preached to her in the health food store, how she started serving Isa, and how she was in a conflict with her husband because she was serving Isa more than she was serving the family. I said, “You’re doing a lot of service. You must be a devotee.” She said, “A devotee? I don‘t know what a devotee is. All I know is she talks about Krsna.” And she said, “All I know is, I love Isa. And if loving Isa means I am a devotee, then I am a devotee.”</p>\n<p>\tI could see that this woman’s heart was really being transformed by associating with Isa. She was just so dedicated to serving her. She was already making plans, how they could add on to her home so that when Isa got out from the rehabilitation hospital Isa could move in with them so that she could take care of her. They weren‘t a very wealthy family, but she was ready to do anything for Isa. Still, the husband he was a little reluctant. And it turned out that the husband started putting up some resistance…</p>\n<p>\tThe best part is yet to come. This is leading up to the best part. Do you want me to end? &lt;Devotees say no&gt; Ok, I‘ll continue. And I‘ll try to not keep you too long from your feast. But don‘t forget, Mother Isa would fast. She wouldn‘t be so much concerned about the feast. She only wanted to hear and chant about Krsna.</p>\n<p>\tSo, it was a problem. The husband didn‘t want Isa to move into their home. Sandy was explaining all this to us. All of a sudden another nurse walked over to the table, and Isa looked up and she sternly asked, “Are you a vegetarian?” And Sandy started clapping, “That‘s the Isa I know.” She was so happy. Immediately she said, “Isa is coming back. That‘s the Isa I know. She is always preaching.” Meanwhile, the nurse was just startled. She didn‘t know what to say. She said, “Well, I try not to eat red meat.” Isa wasn‘t satisfied. She just gave a dirty look, but she didn‘t say anything more. Damodara had to explain to her about the benefits of being vegetarian. The woman left, saying, “Well, I am going to think seriously about becoming vegetarian now.”</p>\n<p>\tSo, we went back into Isa‘s room, and there was another devotee…Actually, this was another visit, not the same visit. Isa was already in the room when I came with another devotee. Isa was staring at this devotee as he was chanting japa; she was staring at his bead bag. I asked Sandy, “Where are her beads? Does she have beads?” Sandy said, “Actually, no. Her beads broke when she fell down the stairs during her stroke. She has no beads.” She said, “But my husband is restringing them for her.” But Mother Isa was still looking at the bead bag. Although we were trying to get her to communicate, she just wouldn‘t take her eyes away from the bead bag. So the devotee, Yamuna Jivana, gave his bead bag to Isa. Isa looked like a little child who had just received a Christmas present she had been waiting for all year. She put her hand into the bead bag immediately and just started chanting, “Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna…” She didn‘t notice anything else that was going on in the room. She just stayed that way for the whole rest of the visit, just chanting japa, as if she had been waiting such a long time for those beads.</p>\n<p>\tUnfortunately, that was the last time I saw Isa until just two weeks ago. But I arranged for a whole group of devotees to rotate and go visit her from time to time. After a while I found out they were becoming a little negligent, and nobody was visiting her. So, just on my last trip to the United States I took two other devotees with me, and we went down to the nursing home where she is now. We tried very hard to find a way that Mother Isa could live with devotees, so that devotees could take care of her. But it was very, very difficult. I knew that Mother Isa had some funds, because one time she called me and asked for my name – she wanted to put my name into her will so that all her money would be given to me when she died.</p>\n<p>\tSo, I asked Sandy, because Sandy took responsibility for her accounts also, how much money was available? Maybe we could build a house in one of the farm communities, and the devotees could take care of her. Unfortunately, it wasn‘t very much. But, even worse, her niece refused to let her be taken away. Her niece had full custody of Isa, because she was the only living relative. They wouldn‘t let us take her to any place far from where she had been living.</p>\n<p>\tWe went to the nursing home. I hadn‘t seen Mother Isa for five or six years. She was wheeled into the room. I could see that she was a lot older. When I talked to her she was a lot less responsive. Her memory was practically completely gone. When I would talk to her, I would say, “Isa, tell me something about Prabhupada. Tell me something about Krsna.” She would just look at me very intensely – in the eyes – but she couldn‘t say anything. So, I decided to go to the nurses’ station to ask them if they could tell me about her current state. I told them who I was and how I had known her for almost forty years. I was told at the nurses’ station that actually the morning is a very bad time of day to get her to respond because she is very, very tired. The nurse said, “But if you come during the day, she‘ll sing the Krsna song for you.” I said, “Oh, really?” Immediately I became enlivened, because I knew she was still chanting. I couldn‘t imagine Mother Isa not chanting Hare Krsna. So, I went back into the room again and I reached out for her hand, and she immediately grabbed my hand very tightly.</p>\n<p>\tI said, “Mother Isa, Hare Krsna.” And she looked at me and said, “Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna…” She chanted the whole mantra all the way through. She did this for several minutes. But we couldn‘t get her to say anything else but the maha-mantra. That‘s all she could say. We could see that she was very tired, so we decided after forty-five minutes that we would leave and try to come back some time in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>\tAs we were leaving the nursing home, one of the nurses saw me out of the corner of her eye – I was dressed in my robes – she was helping a group of elderly people to get into a van. She came over to me and said, “Who are you here to see?” So I said, “I am here to see Edith Graves.” She said, “I knew it. I love that woman. Everybody in this whole building loves that woman. She‘s the most peaceful person, so self contented. She never complains. Every Friday we get together and we sing patriotic songs together. And she leads everybody in a Krsna song.” The whole group of people, she just starts leading them in kirtana. She just chants Hare Krsna, and everybody just follows along and chants with her.</p>\n<p>\tThere was another elderly woman in a wheelchair. She was being wheeled onto the van. She immediately put her hand out and she said, “Very nice to meet you. My name is Kay. I love that woman too. That woman is a real live wire. When she starts chanting that Krsna song with such enthusiasm, everybody just has to chant. Everybody has to sing with her. Tell me, how old is she? Nobody knows how old she is.” I said, “She is ninety-five years old.” She said, “Oh.” Maybe she became very reverential when she heard that Isa was ninety-five years old. She begged us, “Please come back again.” And the other nurse said, “Please come back. You have to come and see her. Nobody has been visiting her.” So I thanked them profusely, and I told them, “Thank you for sharing these stories about Isa with me. It means so much to me. We‘ll definitely come back.”</p>\n<p>\tSo the devotee that came with me, it just so happened that he had to be near there on that Friday afternoon. So I told him, “You have to take a camera. I want you to take a video of Mother Isa chanting. Then you should interview everybody and ask them what they think about her.” As it turned out, there was a strict policy in the nursing home not to allow events to be videotaped. They obviously don’t allow anybody to go around and interview people on video. But this devotee took some video clips of Mother Isa chanting. She can‘t say anything from memory, except the Hare Krsna mantra. Sometimes she may repeat a word or two, but it‘s just repetition. But as soon she starts with the Hare Krsna mantra, it just comes out with such enthusiasm, with such devotion – it‘s profound.</p>\n<p>\tI’m thinking that Krsna has taken away everything, but she has everything she needs for a perfect life. She doesn‘t have to think about her body, she doesn‘t complain about anything, she doesn‘t have to think about anything, because the only thing she can think about is the holy name. It‘s the only thing that comes out of her mouth. I tried to get something else, but nothing else would come, just the Holy name. So, I’m thinking that Krsna, who is in the heart, has actually rewarded her for a life of only speaking about Krsna.</p>\n<p>\tI wrote the story and I put it on the internet, and devotees are writing back and leaving little comments. Sivarama Maharaja says, “If having a stroke means that all I’ll be able to say is Hare Krsna, then maybe I should have a stroke.” Other devotees are writing things like this, “Wonderful! It‘s amazing! All glories to Prabhupada! This is shocking!”</p>\n<p>\tNow we are going to show this video. It‘s ten minutes. But I want you to take note what she does when the woman who is with her tries to get her to chant. When she chants, the woman and Syamarupa both say, “That‘s wonderful, Mother Isa.” Watch the expression on her face when they say, “That‘s wonderful, Mother Isa.” It‘s the same expression she would always show when everybody would try to glorify her. Because she never wanted glorification. She would always think nothing of it. She didn’t want to hear it. So when you hear, “That’s wonderful,” watch her expression. The other thing…towards the end you‘ll see such an effulgent smile. It will melt your heart. For me, it brings tears to my eyes, because she is my siksa-guru. She has always been an object of my meditation.</p>\n<p>\tSo, I’d like to introduce you to Mother Isa. Hare Krsna.\n</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xP3hyLKXHxc?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n",

I am always encouraged by the dedication these devotees have towards keeping the hospital focused not only as a hospital which provides excellent physical care for its patients, but even more significantly as a hospital which provides excellent spiritual care for anyone who enters its doors-- which makes Bhaktivedanta Hospital a major preaching force for expanding the glories of the Krsna's holy names.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI was greeted by Vishvarupa Prabhu when I arrived and then while Madana-mohana was having X-rays taken of his knee, Devananda and I were taken on a tour to see all the new developments which have come up since my last visit. After a one-hour tour and having been introduced to many of the new important staff members who have taken up the daily chanting of sixteen rounds and following the four regulative principles, we relocated to Visvarupa Prabhu's home nearby for lunch with Dwakadish Prabhu, the head physician of the hospital, with Visvarupa Prabhu, the head of the spiritual care department, with Madhavananda Prabhu, the head administrator of the hospital, with Giriraja Prabhu, the head of orthopedic surgery, with Vaisnava Seva Prabhu, also a surgeon (and in addition who is the primary force behind http://iskcondesiretree.net), and with Adi Kesava Prabhu who is the head of the dermatology department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe talked extensively about the hospital, it's goals, and about the way they planned to expand it's various programs for spreading Krsna consciousness. As I was listening to the many stories about how people were becoming devotees by having come in contact with the doctors, nurses and staff members of the Bhaktivedanta Hospital, the thought occured to me that someone should write a book of these stories. I mentioned this to them, and they admitted that although there were so many stories which could be compiled, to date they were so busy that they were unable to compile them. I then volunteered to help them find somebody who could take up the task of interviewing doctors, staff members, patients, and family members for the purpose of putting their interviews into a book. I already have someone in mind, but since he may not be available, I would be interested to hear if any of you, my readers, might have a proposal of someone who is good at interviewing and writing. Obviously they should be fluent in Engliah and should have some training in journalism.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother interesting point about the Bhaktivedanta Hospital is that this year, during the GBC meetings, Madhavananda Prabhu came and gave a presentation to the GBC about the goals and vision of the hospital and about the developments which have evolved over the years since its inception. At the bottom of this blog you will soon find the Power Point presentation which Madhavananda Prabhu spoke from during his presentation to the GBC. Although there is no narration, just by following each slide of the presentation you will get a good sense of what his presentation was all about.

				"value": "<p>After observing Holy Name Day in Budapest on November 18th, 2012, I spent twelve hours flying all day to New Jersey on November 19th. Today is December 4th, 2012. Since devotees may be wondering where I've been and what I've been doing, I thought I should fill everyone in on the events I've been involved with over the past two weeks. Although I was quite active, I decided to take a break from recording lectures and kirtans, something which I oftentimes take responsibility to do myself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNovember 22, 2012 was Thanksgiving Day in the United States. According to tradition, most Americans spend time with family that day, have a big feast on unmentionable items they call food, sit around and drink after the meal, and watch football games on television well into the evening. Also, since it's a four-day weekend,  it's the biggest travel weekend of the year. On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and on the Sunday that follows, the roads, airports, train stations, bus stations and every possible venue for travel are all heavily packed with travellers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnticipating the heavy traffic on November 21st, I decided to immediately relocate to Hartford the day after I arrived in Newark, New Jersey, in order to avoid the heavy congestion expected on the roads on the 21st. Unfortunately, as it turned out, it was heavy even on the 20th. What should have taken two and a half hours took almost four hours. I arrived in Hartford by early evening on the 20th, rested from all of my travels (including the jet-lag from my transatlantic flight) on the 21st and then celebrated Thanksgiving Day, November 22nd, with the Hartford devotees at the Hartford temple with a big kirtan and an amazing feast, prepared by one of ISKCON's best cooks, Jivanausadhi devi dasi. I have to confess, I broke my kichri (no-salt) diet that day and felt no regrets whatsoever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt 4:00 AM the following morning, Pyari Mohan Prabhu and I were on our way to the airport to catch our 6:00 AM flight to Atlanta, and then our connection to Jacksonville, Florida, where we picked up our rental vehicle in order to continue to Alachua, Florida for two full days of 12-hour kirtan. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral of the youth from the Alachua, Florida community started organizing these kirtan festivals a few years ago and this year they had contacted me several times, asking if I would be willing to take part. I had heard that these devotees had adopted a mood similar to that which we've incorporated into the Bhakti Sangama Festival in Ukraine. Although the scale of the event is not quite the same, still, wanting to encourage them in their efforts, I committed myself to take part in their kirtan event as much as I possibly could during the two full days it was held. So although they gave me a slot from 7:00 – 8:00 PM on the 23rd, and from 10:15 to 11:15 AM on the 24th, I spent most of both days just sitting and chanting with all of the assembled devotees. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have to admit, the event was fantastic, the mood was great, the kirtans were great, and when I finally got the opportunity to talk with all the organizers on the evening of the 24th, we were really all enlivened when we all started sharing our visions and moods for hosting festivals on a donation basis only with no fixed fees. Personally I was very encouraged to see that these youth were really wonderfully motivated to facilitate kirtan at its best. They begged me to come back next year, and I'm already thinking how I can be there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was especially wonderful for me in Alachua because Pyari Mohan Prabhu and I spent both evenings at the home of my godbrother, Purusartha Prabhu and his wife, Tulasi dd. When we weren't in kirtans, we were in great association, discussing many philosophical issues which seemed to be enriching discussions for us all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarly Sunday morning, Pyari Mohan and I set out for our next destination. We had an eight-hour drive ahead of us to Charlotte, North Carolina, where devotees were gathering for a Sunday program I was scheduled to give at 6:30 PM.  Jagadish dasa and Savitri dd, formerly from Ukraine, now living in Alachua, prepared enough prasadam for a week-long trip. One thing Pyari Mohan Prabhu and I did not have to worry about was going hungry on the way to North Carolina. We arrived in Charlotte by 6:00 PM, and by 6:30 PM, I was leading kirtan and then gave an hour long lecture from \"The Teachings of Queen Kunti.\" After the lecture, we chanted Damodarastakam, had another short kirtan, and then we continued another two hours to Prabhupada Village, in Sandy Ridge, North Carolina.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrabhupada Village is not your typical rural community project. It is unique in many respects. One of the community's greatest assets is the wealth of devotional experience it has in it's members. Prabhupada Village is home to many senior disciples of Srila Prabhupada. I felt both fortunate and privileged to be given the opportunity to spend the next three days in their association, chanting with them, honoring prasadam with them, and speaking daily whatever meager realizations I could muster up to share with the already-experienced devotees living there. Although by the way each evening program was arranged, it may have appeared that I was sharing with them, but it was I who learned a lot from all of them. I pray that they will consider me their servant whenever I get the next opportunity to be with them in their community once again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarly on the morning of November 29th, Pyari Mohan Prabhu and I set out for the 8-10 hour drive back to Jacksonville, Florida. Unfortunately, I also took along some kind of virus with me, which prevented me from holding down food for almost five days. By the time I finished my two flights back to Hartford on November 30th, I was ready to see a doctor. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn December 1st, I was told that I had an upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, a fever, and I had to immediately be put on antibiotics and other medications. Rest also became mandatory, and rest is exactly what I've been doing already for three continuous days. And although I'm supposed to leave for Boston soon, I'm already questioning whether I'm going to be able to do anything at all once I get there. That will have to remain to be seen. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, I have no choice. I am going to continue to rest because other than write this brief report, that's really all I can do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHare Krishna<br />\r\n </p>",

I pray that they will consider me their servant whenever I get the next opportunity to be with them in their community once again.</p>\n<p>Early on the morning of November 29th, Pyari Mohan Prabhu and I set out for the 8-10 hour drive back to Jacksonville, Florida. Unfortunately, I also took along some kind of virus with me, which prevented me from holding down food for almost five days. By the time I finished my two flights back to Hartford on November 30th, I was ready to see a doctor. </p>\n<p>On December 1st, I was told that I had an upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, a fever, and I had to immediately be put on antibiotics and other medications. Rest also became mandatory, and rest is exactly what I've been doing already for three continuous days. And although I'm supposed to leave for Boston soon, I'm already questioning whether I'm going to be able to do anything at all once I get there. That will have to remain to be seen. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I have no choice. I am going to continue to rest because other than write this brief report, that's really all I can do.</p>\n<p>Hare Krishna\n </p>\n",

Since the doctors could no longer do anything to treat her, the nurses began to administer only that which would give her comfort from pain. From this point on, at least during my visits, other than saying something about \"a beautiful blue sky\", I did not hear anything else from her. My sister said that my mother had been talking about weather just before I entered the room. Still, the way my mother spoke those few words, I could not rule out the thought that she might have been talking about something else. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Saturday the hospice nurses were called in to assess her condition. We were told that her \"vitals\" (blood pressure, heartbeat, and oxygenation) were all strong, a symptom which indicated that she could continue as she was for as long as a week or even much longer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy flight to Europe was scheduled to depart on Monday, October 29th. By Saturday, I was of two minds. \"Should I leave, or should I just stay?\" I tried to call the airline to ask if my ticket could be changed, but discovered that the office I needed to speak to for that particular ticket was closed until Monday. After a short visit to the nursing home on Sunday, I decided to drive to Hartford, half-way between Boston and New York, so that I could be closer to the airport in case I was not able to rebook my ticket on Monday.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs it turned out, Sunday was also the same day that one of the largest hurricanes ever to hit the United States began barrelling through the New York area, closing all of the airports in the Northeast USA by Sunday night for an indefinite period of time. My flight was \"rebooked\" for me. When I finally connected with the airline, it was easy to change the date of my departure, since all the airlines were eager to rebook their passengers due to the storm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy Tuesday morning, October 30th, the brunt of the hurricane had passed. I returned to Boston, settled a few matters and arrived at the nursing home by 7:15 PM to relieve my sister and Saranagati devi dasi so that they could go home for the night instead of staying all night with my mother. My sister had already stayed the whole night before. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRohininandana insisted on staying with my mother on that particular night. We arranged that I would pick him up at the train station nearby. His train was scheduled to arrive at 9:26 PM. Somehow, though it could have not been anything other than Krsna's arrangement, his train was cancelled. Rohininandana texted me at 8:30, stating that he would come whenever he could get the next train. Of course I did not realize it then, but had his train not been cancelled, I would have probably left my mother by 9:10 to pick him up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince I no longer knew how long I would be waiting, I decided to start reading \"Jaiva Dharma.\" Although I became very absorbed in the reading, still I would look up from time to time to see how my mother was doing. At approximately 9:15, I noticed that her breaths appeared longer than they had been. Since my sister had warned me that my mother had apnea and from time to time she would lapse in her breathing, I was unsure if this was a sign of her departure or not. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, not wanting to miss the opportunity, I decided to stand next to her and I just started chanting, all the time watching her breathing. Gradually, the duration of each breath seemed to be getting longer and longer. I just continued to chant. Within the next five minutes she took one very long breath and that was her last. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough many thoughts started to surface, somehow, the most prominent was a feeling of great satisfaction. I realized that Krsna arranged everything so that I would be able to fulfill the original purpose behind my journey to be with her. Had He not intervened, as much as I had wanted to, I probably would have not been there to chant for her during the time of her passing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHare Krsna<br />\r\n </p>",

All glories to Guru Parampara! All glories to Srila Prabhupada!</p>\r\n<p>Please accept humble obeisances at the dust of your lotus feet from Nilakantha Priya dd from Vladikavkaz, an imperfect disciple of HH Gopal Krishna Goswami and the daughter of Nadeshi devi dasi.</p>\r\n<p>I am praying to Lord Krishna that your health may always remain good for the pleasure of your disciples and well-wishers.</p>\r\n<p>Dear Guru Maharaja, please let me share my realizations that Lord Krishna allowed me to experience in connection with disappearance of the servant of devotees, your disciple Nadeshi dd.</p>\r\n<p>Nadeshidd left this material world at the age of 77 at 1.30 a.m. by Moscow time on the 16th of September, listening to maha mantra Hare Krishna. Two days before she left, September 13, she had to undergo an abdominal region surgery - the state of her physical body was critical because of duodenum ulcer perforation accompanies by weakness of her heart and lungs. Condition of Nadeshi was very critical but she always remained conscious. To satisfy devotees and relatives Nadeshi agreed to undergo a surgery, even though she didn't want to stay in her body and was sure she will leave.</p>\r\n<p>Dear Guru Maharaja, after you have mercifully given Nadeshidd last instructions by phone. Lord Krishna gave her strength to bless every Vaishnava of Vladikavkaz yatra for devotional service, and she gave spiritual advice to everyone who was with her at that time.</p>\r\n<p>One by one devotees entered the intensive care ward to Nadeshidd and came out with a smile and tears in their eyes. I was the last one to enter and asked Nadeshidd to bless me. She was smiling even though her heart was hardly beating. Nadeshi said: «Chant the holy name and serve devotees.</p>\r\n<p>As long as Nadeshi dd remained in her body which by all medical symptoms must have suffered very much, she found some strength for spiritual association with devotees.</p>\r\n<p>She didn't feel any anxiety about her leaving her body, and her last words were: \"I never forget Krishna and I know that 1 am His servant.\" When she was told that she might not be able to bear the anesthesia she laughed as if saying: Is it the reason to worry?</p>\r\n<p>When Nadeshi dd was being wheeled to surgery block, Vaishnavas were standing on both sides from her. Seeing all devotees together, Nadeshi's face beamed with a smile, and her eyes irradiated happiness. She looked completely satisfied.

Nadeshidd loves you very much. I am sure that you are the source of her spiritual strength and inspiration before and after she left. On her paper with Gayatri mantra she put your picture where you are a small boy. Before starting her prayer she would laugh and talk to your picture. She said that even many years later inside you there will still be this wonderful boy, cheerful and mischievous. She would always lament like a mother and would feel pain when you had problems with health. Sometimes I heard her talking to you looking at your photos. At the head of her bed there is your picture and the picture of your feet. She used to say: \"These are unusual feet, they serve Lord Krishna.\"</p>\r\n<p>Dear Guru Maharaja Niranjana Swami, disappearance of Nadeshi dd showed me that spiritual science just like any other science has theory and practice. All this time I've been only studying theory, but Lord Krishna showed that it's time to pass on to practice and check my realization. Inthe situation that I am experiencing now, you, my Guru Maharaja Gopal Krishna Goswami and Nadeshidd give me firm faith that either in this or the other world there is no other way except for serving the servants of Lord Krishna.</p>\r\n<p>With sincere gratitude.</p>\r\n<p>Daughter of your disciple Nadeshi dd who is trying to become a servant of a servant,</p>\r\n<p>Nilakantha Priya dd</p>",

Two days before she left, September 13, she had to undergo an abdominal region surgery - the state of her physical body was critical because of duodenum ulcer perforation accompanies by weakness of her heart and lungs. Condition of Nadeshi was very critical but she always remained conscious. To satisfy devotees and relatives Nadeshi agreed to undergo a surgery, even though she didn't want to stay in her body and was sure she will leave.</p>\n<p>Dear Guru Maharaja, after you have mercifully given Nadeshidd last instructions by phone. Lord Krishna gave her strength to bless every Vaishnava of Vladikavkaz yatra for devotional service, and she gave spiritual advice to everyone who was with her at that time.</p>\n<p>One by one devotees entered the intensive care ward to Nadeshidd and came out with a smile and tears in their eyes. I was the last one to enter and asked Nadeshidd to bless me. She was smiling even though her heart was hardly beating. Nadeshi said: «Chant the holy name and serve devotees.</p>\n<p>As long as Nadeshi dd remained in her body which by all medical symptoms must have suffered very much, she found some strength for spiritual association with devotees.</p>\n<p>She didn't feel any anxiety about her leaving her body, and her last words were: \"I never forget Krishna and I know that 1 am His servant.\" When she was told that she might not be able to bear the anesthesia she laughed as if saying: Is it the reason to worry?</p>\n<p>When Nadeshi dd was being wheeled to surgery block, Vaishnavas were standing on both sides from her. Seeing all devotees together, Nadeshi's face beamed with a smile, and her eyes irradiated happiness. She looked completely satisfied. By the mercy of Lord Krishna as well as by your mercy, dear Guru Maharaja, at the surgery and later, at the intensive care ward next to Nadeshi there were her Deities Gaura-Nitay, Tulsi-devi, water from Radha-kund and the dust of Vrindavan.</p>\n<p>After the surgery Nadeshi regained consciousness but she couldn't breathe independently.

				"value": "<p>During the seminars I gave in Evpatoriya, questions based on my classes had been collected and submitted to me. However, due to the limited time available for each class, I did not start answering these questions until the last day. When it became obvious that there was still not enough time to answer questions, I announced that I would try to answer some of them here in my blog. Here are a few of them along with my answers: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuestion #1) What to do if one is forcefully involved in discussing others? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnswer: Every devotee needs to discriminate between topics about others that are necessary to hear and topics that are not necessary to hear. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn example of topics necessary to hear could be if one is in a position capable of helping the devotee being discussed--- for instance, if one is accepted as a spiritual authority and is trusted by the devotee being discussed. In this case, the devotee who is speaking should speak only to those who are in that position. In other words, it should be a confidential discussion and the decision on whether the devotee under discussion can be helped or not should be left up to the person who is the spiritual authority for the devotee being discussed. In this case, it may seem that one is forced by circumstances to hear about another devotee. Still one should try to accept it as an opportunity to serve that devotee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf one is not in a position of being able to help the devotee being discussed, then there is no need to listen to such discussions. If the speaker tries to force the topic upon the listener, then the listener should simply ask the speaker what is his/her intention for telling this to him/her and should then try his/her best to avoid hearing the unnecessary talk about others. If the devotee continues to speak anyway, one solution would be to just leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, this answer does not cover the full spectrum of possible scenarios related to this question, but, in principle, it is a good guideline to follow for most devotees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuestion #2) What to do if one unintentionally hears discussion about others?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnswer: One should apologize to the person discussed and beg forgiveness for listening to something about him/her which wasn't necessary to hear. One should also learn from his/her mistakes in order to be better equipped to avoid such discussions in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuestion #3) How should we behave towards devotees who involve us in talks about others?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnswer: The answer to this question has already been given in the answer to question #1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuestion #4) What to do when devotees open their hearts to us how other devotees treated them improperly?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnswer: We should first ask him/her if it is a confidential discussion based upon a genuine desire from the devotee speaking to ease the pain in his/her heart, or, if it is a complaint about someone which is being propagated without restriction. If it's an unrestricted complaint, then this is really not \"opening one's heart.\" One does not need to listen to it. Opening the heart means that it is spoken in confidence. By definition, \"in confidence\" means \"the telling of a private matter in mutual trust.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut if the account is being spoken in confidence and to only one or two trusted individuals, then we should compassionately listen and try to help the devotee understand what can be learned from that experience. For instance, the blog I posted some time ago about the way I was insulted by my Temple President back in the mid-70's and the way Krsna helped me to deal with that test, is a good example of the type of response which could be offered to help that devotee. There are also many examples in sastra of Vaisnavas who were mistreated but accepted everything that happened to them as the Lord's mercy. Such sastric examples could also be given. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe should also not be quick to judge the person spoken about as malicious, or someone who intentionally harmed the devotee speaking in confidence, especially if it was something that happened only once or twice. Srila Prabhupada writes in the purport to Bhagavad-gita 10.4-5, \"Ksama, tolerance and forgiveness, should be practiced; one should be tolerant and excuse the minor offenses of others.\" We should try our best to encourage this understanding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, in confidence, we could also approach the person who allegedly mistreated the devotee, assure him/her that the devotee who opened his/her heart was not campaigning but was sincerely trying to ease the pain in his/her heart. We could then relate a short summary of the discussion we had with the first devotee in a nonaccusatory way, and ask the devotee to look within his/her own heart to see if there was any justification for the way the first devotee was feeling. We could then suggest to him/her to consider if there was sufficient cause to apologize to the hurt devotee and/or to learn how to avoid something similar in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHare Krsna</p>",

It was during this time that Mother Isa was serving in the BBT in Brooklyn, New York, transcribing Srila Prabhupada's translations and purports to Srimad Bhagavatam.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>My visit to Mother Isa<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout two weeks ago Syamarupa dasa, Caitya Guru dasa and I drove eighty miles south of Boston to visit my godsister, Mother Isa, in southern Massachusetts. I have spoken about Mother Isa many times in my lectures. She is an amazing devotee who would only speak about Krsna and Srila Prabhupada throughout all the time I had known her (at least thirty-five years). I was very eager to see Isa again, especially since I had not seen her since 2006, shortly after the time she had a severe stroke at age 89. The stroke took away almost all of her memory. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore continuing with this blog, please <a href=\"http://niranjanaswami.net/node/5924\">CLICK HERE</a> to read the Vyasa Puja homage I offered to Srila Prabhupada in 2008. After reading my homage, you will have a very good background to better help you understand all that will follow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShortly after Mother Isa's stroke, I, along with several other devotees who knew Mother Isa, made several attempts to situate her in a place where she could be cared for by devotees. Unfortunately, we ran into many obstacles. Among them was a strong resistance from Isa's only living family member, her niece, who would not permit Isa to leave the area. After many weeks of research and inquiries on Isa's behalf, we all had to accept that Isa would have to remain where she was. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoon thereafter we learned that Mother Isa was released from the rehabilitation hospital and was sent to a nearby assisted-living facility. I arranged for devotees to visit her from time to time and would always inquire about her whenever I visited Boston. Some time later she was put under the care of a state nursing home where she now lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we arrived at the nursing home, we signed in and were then directed to a place where we could find Mother Isa. I was taken aback by her appearance, but soon remembered that she is now ninety-five years old. Time has a way changing the body's appearance, but as I was soon to observe, it can not take away the essence of the soul's yearning for Krsna.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI spent the first part of our meeting trying to establish some connection with Mother Isa, but was disappointed to find that she was extremely tired and for the most part was unresponsive to my attempts for a dialogue with her. After fifteen minutes or so, I went back to the nurses' station to tell them who I was in relation to Mother Isa and to ask them if they could tell me all they knew about her current medical state. I did not expect them to be able to tell me about her state of consciousness, knowing that they would probably not understand Mother Isa's symtoms of devotion to Krsna. Still, I explained that she seemed a lot less responsive since the last time I saw her in 2006.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was told that mornings were not a good time for Isa and that if we wanted her to be more responsive, afternoons were always a better time to get her to speak and to hear her sing the \"Krsna chant.\" I immediately smiled when I heard \"the Krsna chant\" and was relieved to learn that she still seemed to be the same Mother Isa I always knew. I couldn't imagine Mother Isa not chanting Hare Krsna. I returned to the visitor's room and tried once again to establish communication with her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis time I held out my hand, started talking to Isa about Srila Prabhupada and Krsna and then tried to induce her to respond to the mahamantra. She gripped my hand tightly, looked very intently, right into my eyes, and started to enthusiastically chant the Hare Krsna mantra together with me two words at a time. This went on for several minutes but it appeared she was too tired for a long session with us. Though I tried to get her to say something else related to Krsna, it seemed that the only words she could speak without difficulty were the Hare Krsna mahamantra. I had hoped for a lot more, but I figured that if that's all she can remember, then what else does she really need?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter spending approximately forty-five minutes with her, we decided that it was probably best to let her rest and to just hope for a better session during another time when we could visit in the latter part of the day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we were leaving the nursing home, there was a vehicle for disabled persons just outside the front door. One by one, residents from the home were being carried into the vehicle in their wheelchairs. One of the nurses who worked there and who was assisting all of them saw me out of the corner of her eye. She noticed that I was dressed in robes and approached me to ask who I had come to see. I told her that I was there to see Edith Graves, which is the name Mother Isa is known by in the nursing home. </p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe woman immediately burst into a huge smile and exclaimed, \"I knew it! When I saw your robes I knew that you must have come to see Edith! I love that woman! Everyone loves that woman! I'm so happy that someone has come to see her. You should come and see her on Friday afternoons at 2:00 PM when we are all gathered to sing patriotic songs. She leads everyone in singing the Krsna song with such enthusiasm.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut that wasn't all. Another elderly woman in a wheelchair was listening nearby. She extended her hand to me and introduced herself as Kay. With the most pleasant smile and a look filled with charm and respect she also started glorifying Mother Isa. \"I love that woman too\", she said. \"She's a real live wire, especially when she sings that beautiful Krsna song for all of us.\" She went on to express her appreciation for Isa and once again confirmed that everyone who knew Isa had nothing but feelings of affection towards her. They described her as the most self-contented person in the whole building. Then she asked, \"Can you tell me how old Edith is?\" I told her that she was ninety-five years old. The woman smiled again and said that she was always wondering how old she was. She then asked all of us to please come back to visit again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI thanked both of them profusely and told them that meeting them was the icing on the cake of my visit to see Mother Isa. I was leaving Isa, feeling somewhat disappointed by her lack of responsiveness. But it was now becoming crystal clear that Mother Isa was none other than the Mother Isa I always knew— taking advantage of every opportunity which came her way to induce other's to chant Krsna's name. Even at the advanced age of ninety-five, and even though she had lost all memory of her past as a result of severe stroke, she was a shining light of enthusiasm for singing the \"Krsna song\" to everyone without reservation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn our way back to Boston I requested Syamarupa dasa to visit Mother Isa on a Friday afternoon in order to film her chanting during the session when everyone sings songs all together. I also asked him if he could interview other workers and residents in order to hear their words of appreciation for Mother Isa. And last but not least, I asked him to establish a clear line of communication with the nursing home so that we could be kept updated if there were any major changes in Mother Isa's state of health.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs it turned out, Syamarupa dasa was scheduled for an evening kirtan event not far from where Mother Isa resides, just three days after the day when we visited her. I gave him the video camera which Madana-mohana dasa uses for making videos of my lectures when we travel together, and asked him if he could get as much on video as he possibly could.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately the nursing home has a strict policy which does not allow visitors to take videos of events. Syamarupa dasa was also unable to interview the residents as we had hoped. Still, he was able to take several video clips of his exchanges with Mother Isa. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease watch the following edited version of the clips Syamarupa dasa took during his visit with Mother Isa and closely observe her. I'm amazed by her enthusiasm and especially by her spontaneity for chanting Krsna's names. She seems to be right there, in Krsna consciousness, when she is chanting, remembering nothing else but Krsna in the form of His holy names.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI find these video clips to be precious and my admiration for Mother Isa and my gratitude for what Srila Prabhupada has given to all of us has increased without limit due to my association with her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada! All glories to Mother Isa!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHare Krsna</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xP3hyLKXHxc\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>",

One by one, residents from the home were being carried into the vehicle in their wheelchairs. One of the nurses who worked there and who was assisting all of them saw me out of the corner of her eye. She noticed that I was dressed in robes and approached me to ask who I had come to see. I told her that I was there to see Edith Graves, which is the name Mother Isa is known by in the nursing home. </p>\n<p>\nThe woman immediately burst into a huge smile and exclaimed, \"I knew it! When I saw your robes I knew that you must have come to see Edith! I love that woman! Everyone loves that woman! I'm so happy that someone has come to see her. You should come and see her on Friday afternoons at 2:00 PM when we are all gathered to sing patriotic songs. She leads everyone in singing the Krsna song with such enthusiasm.\"</p>\n<p>But that wasn't all. Another elderly woman in a wheelchair was listening nearby. She extended her hand to me and introduced herself as Kay. With the most pleasant smile and a look filled with charm and respect she also started glorifying Mother Isa. \"I love that woman too\", she said. \"She's a real live wire, especially when she sings that beautiful Krsna song for all of us.\" She went on to express her appreciation for Isa and once again confirmed that everyone who knew Isa had nothing but feelings of affection towards her. They described her as the most self-contented person in the whole building. Then she asked, \"Can you tell me how old Edith is?\" I told her that she was ninety-five years old. The woman smiled again and said that she was always wondering how old she was. She then asked all of us to please come back to visit again.</p>\n<p>I thanked both of them profusely and told them that meeting them was the icing on the cake of my visit to see Mother Isa. I was leaving Isa, feeling somewhat disappointed by her lack of responsiveness. But it was now becoming crystal clear that Mother Isa was none other than the Mother Isa I always knew— taking advantage of every opportunity which came her way to induce other's to chant Krsna's name. Even at the advanced age of ninety-five, and even though she had lost all memory of her past as a result of severe stroke, she was a shining light of enthusiasm for singing the \"Krsna song\" to everyone without reservation.</p>\n<p>On our way back to Boston I requested Syamarupa dasa to visit Mother Isa on a Friday afternoon in order to film her chanting during the session when everyone sings songs all together. I also asked him if he could interview other workers and residents in order to hear their words of appreciation for Mother Isa. And last but not least, I asked him to establish a clear line of communication with the nursing home so that we could be kept updated if there were any major changes in Mother Isa's state of health.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Syamarupa dasa was scheduled for an evening kirtan event not far from where Mother Isa resides, just three days after the day when we visited her. I gave him the video camera which Madana-mohana dasa uses for making videos of my lectures when we travel together, and asked him if he could get as much on video as he possibly could.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the nursing home has a strict policy which does not allow visitors to take videos of events. Syamarupa dasa was also unable to interview the residents as we had hoped. Still, he was able to take several video clips of his exchanges with Mother Isa. </p>\n<p>Please watch the following edited version of the clips Syamarupa dasa took during his visit with Mother Isa and closely observe her. I'm amazed by her enthusiasm and especially by her spontaneity for chanting Krsna's names. She seems to be right there, in Krsna consciousness, when she is chanting, remembering nothing else but Krsna in the form of His holy names.</p>\n<p>I find these video clips to be precious and my admiration for Mother Isa and my gratitude for what Srila Prabhupada has given to all of us has increased without limit due to my association with her.</p>\n<p>All glories to Srila Prabhupada! All glories to Mother Isa!</p>\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xP3hyLKXHxc\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\n",

I often tell the story of how one quote from that lecture had a very deep impact on me and how it saved me shortly after I moved into the Boston temple.

This humility is very good in devotional service. Therefore Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu teaches us, trnad api sunicena taror api sahisnuna: \"One should be more tolerant than the tree and humbler than the grass to make progress in spiritual life.\" This is necessary because for one who is living in this material world there will be so many disturbances, just as if one were traveling on the ocean. One cannot expect a very peaceful situation on the ocean; even a big ship may also be unsteady, and at any moment there may be tumultuous waves. Similarly, in this material world we should always expect danger; one cannot expect a very peaceful life within this material world. The sastra, the Vedic literature, says, padam padam yad vipadam (SB 10.14.58): at every step there is danger.

Maya will test us to see how firmly we are fixed in Krsna consciousness. Because she is also an agent of Krsna, she does not allow anyone the freedom to disturb Krsna. Therefore she tests very rigidly to see whether we have taken to Krsna consciousness to disturb Krsna or are actually serious. That is Maya's business. So in the beginning there will be tests by Maya, and we shall feel so many disturbances while making progress in Krsna consciousness. But if we follow the rules and regulations and chant regularly as prescribed, then we shall remain steady. If we neglect these principles, Maya will capture us immediately. Maya is always ready. We are in the ocean, and at any moment we may be disturbed.\"<br />\r\n </p>",

				"value": "<p>Dear Srila Prabhupada,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease accept my prostrated obeisances in the dust of your lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the months of May/June, 1972, you wrote individualized letters to several disciples containing the same theme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Now I want that we shall concentrate on making our devotees Krishna conscious and ourselves becoming Krishna conscious, and not be so much concerned with expanding ourselves widely but without any spiritual content. Just like boiling the milk, it becomes thicker and sweeter. Now do like that, boil the milk.\" (Letter to: Rupanuga  --  Honolulu 9 May, 1972)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot long after these letters were written, a guest began visiting your temple in Boston. Little did he know at the time that this was your mood. Neither was this ever discussed. As far as he knew, Krishna consciousness was still expanding widely, and the clarion call to recruit many more soldiers into Lord Caitanya's Sankirtan army was gradually drawing another recruit into its ranks. His name—or as he was called then—was \"Bhakta Neal\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, exactly forty years later, this same recruit (known now as Niranjana Swami) is just beginning to realize that the condensed milk preparation you wanted to make at that time still needs more boiling, especially because he, somehow or other, was added into the preparation even though you wanted only to turn up the flame.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"You can thin milk by adding water and you can make it thick by boiling. Now is the time for us to begin the boiling process.\" (Letter to: Damodara  --  Honolulu 9 May, 1972)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSrila Prabhupada, you are the best cook ISKCON has ever known and with your own hands you personally taught disciples how to cook for Krishna's pleasure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"On the Tuesday afternoon, at the request of Tusta Krishna, Prabhupada entered the kitchen to show a couple of the ladies how to cook milk sweets.[…]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[…]Prabhupada poured a couple of litres of milk into a wide pan, added sugar and brought it to a rapid, rolling boil. Stirring methodically, he condensed the sweetened milk until it reached a creamy, sauce-like consistency. Lowering the heat, and stirring more firmly, he further reduced the mixture to a very thick, dark cream-coloured sticky paste that started to pull away from the sides.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrabhupada then scraped the milk fudge onto the side of the pan. It was done. Now the burfi, when cooled, could be rolled into balls, or pressed into a tray and cut into squares, ready to offer to Radha and Krishna.\"  (The Great Transcendental Adventure by Kurma dasa)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSrila Prabhupada, ISKCON is one of your preparations still requiring your attention. I know because I am that Niranjana Swami who slipped into your movement even though you warned that no more recruits should come until everyone was more perfectly trained. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n[…]We may thin the milk till it becomes useless, or we may boil it until it becomes thick and sweet, so now we have got enough followers, let us train them up perfectly in the philosophy and activities of Krishna Consciousness way of life. \" (Letter to: StokaKrishna  --  Los Angeles 20 June, 1972)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm not sure why you allowed me to join despite my lack of qualifications. Neither can I understand why you accepted me as your disciple very shortly thereafter. Both of these events can only be explained as your unlimited and causeless mercy and my gratitude for this knows no bounds. I did not deserve to be trained in the way that you called for it forty years back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am sorry to confess this to you, but after forty years in your service, I am still not fully trained.

				"safe_value": "<p>Dear Srila Prabhupada,</p>\n<p>Please accept my prostrated obeisances in the dust of your lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.</p>\n<p>During the months of May/June, 1972, you wrote individualized letters to several disciples containing the same theme.</p>\n<p>\"Now I want that we shall concentrate on making our devotees Krishna conscious and ourselves becoming Krishna conscious, and not be so much concerned with expanding ourselves widely but without any spiritual content. Just like boiling the milk, it becomes thicker and sweeter. Now do like that, boil the milk.\" (Letter to: Rupanuga  --  Honolulu 9 May, 1972)</p>\n<p>Not long after these letters were written, a guest began visiting your temple in Boston. Little did he know at the time that this was your mood. Neither was this ever discussed. As far as he knew, Krishna consciousness was still expanding widely, and the clarion call to recruit many more soldiers into Lord Caitanya's Sankirtan army was gradually drawing another recruit into its ranks. His name—or as he was called then—was \"Bhakta Neal\".</p>\n<p>Now, exactly forty years later, this same recruit (known now as Niranjana Swami) is just beginning to realize that the condensed milk preparation you wanted to make at that time still needs more boiling, especially because he, somehow or other, was added into the preparation even though you wanted only to turn up the flame.</p>\n<p>\"You can thin milk by adding water and you can make it thick by boiling. Now is the time for us to begin the boiling process.\" (Letter to: Damodara  --  Honolulu 9 May, 1972)</p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada, you are the best cook ISKCON has ever known and with your own hands you personally taught disciples how to cook for Krishna's pleasure.</p>\n<p>\"On the Tuesday afternoon, at the request of Tusta Krishna, Prabhupada entered the kitchen to show a couple of the ladies how to cook milk sweets.[…]</p>\n<p>[…]Prabhupada poured a couple of litres of milk into a wide pan, added sugar and brought it to a rapid, rolling boil. Stirring methodically, he condensed the sweetened milk until it reached a creamy, sauce-like consistency. Lowering the heat, and stirring more firmly, he further reduced the mixture to a very thick, dark cream-coloured sticky paste that started to pull away from the sides.</p>\n<p>Prabhupada then scraped the milk fudge onto the side of the pan. It was done. Now the burfi, when cooled, could be rolled into balls, or pressed into a tray and cut into squares, ready to offer to Radha and Krishna.\"  (The Great Transcendental Adventure by Kurma dasa)</p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada, ISKCON is one of your preparations still requiring your attention. I know because I am that Niranjana Swami who slipped into your movement even though you warned that no more recruits should come until everyone was more perfectly trained. </p>\n<p>[…]We may thin the milk till it becomes useless, or we may boil it until it becomes thick and sweet, so now we have got enough followers, let us train them up perfectly in the philosophy and activities of Krishna Consciousness way of life. \" (Letter to: StokaKrishna  --  Los Angeles 20 June, 1972)</p>\n<p>I'm not sure why you allowed me to join despite my lack of qualifications. Neither can I understand why you accepted me as your disciple very shortly thereafter. Both of these events can only be explained as your unlimited and causeless mercy and my gratitude for this knows no bounds. I did not deserve to be trained in the way that you called for it forty years back.</p>\n<p>I am sorry to confess this to you, but after forty years in your service, I am still not fully trained. Due to my own causeless unwillingness to surrender, I have been unable to fully embrace all that you came to give us. </p>\n<p>On this most auspicious day of your divine appearance in this world, I beg you. Please continue this boiling process with me and never stop training me up \"in the philosophy and activities of Krishna Consciousness way of life\". Help me to become \"thick and sweet\" and don't allow me to water down your mission any longer. </p>\n<p>Some day, whenever you deem fit, please allow me to truly follow in your footsteps and cook very condensed sweets, making each of them ready to be offered to the lotus feet of Radha and Krishna. </p>\n<p>Your faithful servant, always in need of the dust from your two lotus feet,</p>\n<p>Niranjana Swami\n </p>\n",

It is also my hope that those who do have this inclination or who have had this inclination in the past will not feel that their desires to make these transcriptions available or not appreciated by me.

She oversees all lecture transcriptions which are published in my books. She is fully conversant with my policy and knows my wishes in this regard. If anyone ever has any questions about my policies, even after reading this blog, they can contact her at the address found in the front of my books and I am confident that she will be able to help.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBesides Gauranga Press, however, currently there are also transcribed lectures posted on fileshare.niranjanaswami.org. These Russian translations are not reviewed by Gauranga Press, but still every transcription, whether published in books or on fileshare.niranjanaswami.org follows a similar procedure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery lecture transcription is first done in English based upon the words I have spoken (not the translator's words). After they have been transcribed (and in some cases also edited) they come to me to be checked for accuracy before they can be published in books or on the site. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerally, for all transcriptions made for posting on fileshare.niranjanaswami.org, I find numerous mistakes.

But at least my English is also right there if anyone wishes to cross-reference something which may not be clear. But when something is put into writing, in black and white, and when it's only in Russian, the mistake carries far more weight. Once it's in writing, it's there in perpetuity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore I humbly request that if anyone has transcriptions of my lectures which were not first transcribed into English and then checked by me, please do not disseminate them.

After some time, Srila Prabhupada opened his eyes for a moment and without moving his head looked gently but seriously at us, one after the other, and pronounced, \"Just go on chanting and all your problems will be solved.\"</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>I have a two-hour transit in Munich Airport on my way back to Budapest from Bologna today. I thought I would take advantage of the available time here to say a few words about my visit to Bologna.</p>\r\n<p>As many of you probably know, I try to visit Bologna every year to spend time with my godbrother Trai Prabhu and his wife Krsnaloka dd. Although while I'm there, I take part in other events, the primary reason I go there is because Trai Prabhu is there. I'm always happy to be with him, to chant with him, and to discuss Krsna consciousness with him. One of the topics we talked about today was about the importance of inspiring the second generation of devotees to appreciate, hear from, and serve senior devotees other than their own initiating spiritual masters. I had many things to say on this topic. But just as important to me is to just simply do it. I therefore go to Bologna every year to associate with, to hear from, and to assist Trai Prabhu in his service.</p>\r\n<p>There was an added attraction this trip to Bologna for me. About thirty years ago when I was preaching throughout Northeast USA, I met a young man during a program I was doing at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He was also a student at Yale and had no contact with Krsna consciousness prior to my first meeting with him. Gradually, by attending programs and visiting temples, his interest in Krsna consciousness grew. He graduated from Yale, and soon thereafter joined the Boston temple, took initiation from H.H. Satsvarupa das Goswami and was given the name Dhananjaya Pandit dasa. I had a close relationship with him throughout the years he served in Boston. Unfortunately, however, in 1989, while I was overseas, he left the temple and I never saw him again. I was devastated when I learned he had left. I always considered him a very sincere person. Despite his sudden departure, I felt strongly that he would come back to Srila Prabhupada's service some day.</p>\r\n<p>In January of this year, while I was in Boston, Dhananjaya Pandit happened to be visiting his family and decided to come to the temple. We met, we embraced, and we spoke for some time. Although twenty-three years had passed since the last time I saw him, it was very easy for me to be with him again. Before he left the temple that evening, I learned that he was living in Italy about a ninety-minute drive from Trai Prabhu. We parted ways but we also assured each other that we would meet again in Italy some time.</p>\r\n<p>By Krsna's grace, during this visit, Dhananjaya Pandit came to Bologna three of the four days I was there. We spent more time catching up on each other's lives. During our discussion he several times described how he was seeing so many indications that Krsna was drawing him back into the association of devotees once again. He also said that he has been downloading many of my recent lectures from this site and has been reguarly listening to them attentively. He thanked me for the lectures and even quoted some of the topics about which I had spoken within them. Already he has begun helping both Trai Prabhu and myself with our websites and he also plans to continue visiting Bologna to spend time with Trai Prabhu and his wife. I pray that Krsna will remove all obstacles from his path back to Srila Prabhupada's service.</p>\r\n<p>While in Bologna Trai Prabhu organized two very wonderful programs for me. We had an intimate gathering in his home on Friday evening. Everyone was so happy to take part in the program that we did not finish with the kirtans and talk until almost 11:00 PM. I spoke about the importance of appreciating even the smallest amount of service rendered sincerely and gave many examples how the Lord accepts such service from His devotees.</p>\r\n<p>The following evening Trai Prabhu organized a public program at the Bologna Center for Vedic Culture, the center that he and Krsnaloka devi dasi have been managing in Bologna for several years. Trai Prabhu asked me to speak on the topic, \"What is Our Karma Teaching Us and How to Learn from Our Mistakes.\" More than fifty guests attended the program. Everyone was listening so attentively to the talk that I did not want to stop. Questions continued for at least another half-hour after the talk. We then had a very enthusiastic kirtan, followed by an opulent \"Italian\" feast of lasagna, bread, and many other tasty preparations (I heard they were very tasty but unfortunately I was not able to experience it for myself). During the feast many guests gathered with Trai and myself to ask more questions about Krsna consciousness.  </p>\r\n<p>In Bologna, Trai Prabhu organizes a Saturday lecture and feast for the local Italian people and on Sunday there is a Sunday Feast and lecture organized by Bangladeshi devotees for the Bangladeshi devotees and congregation. Since many of the guests understand only Bengali and since nobody there knows both English and Bengali well enough to translate for me, I did not take part in the Sunday program. Instead I spent Sunday with Trai Prabhu and Krsnaloka dd and we spent the evening having kirtan together in their home.</p>\r\n<p>Before I left Bologna this morning, Krsnaloka gave me some photos she had taken of both events along with some very beautiful photos of the deities at the center and the deities Trai Prabhu and Krsnaloka worship in their home. All of those photos will be posted soon here in the photo gallery.</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>",

I just received this information a few days ago.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn principle (not only because it is my principle, but also because as I understand, it is a fundamental principle within ISKCON) it is the responsibility of any visiting preacher to serve the interests of the yatra he/she is visiting by first inquiring from the local leaders, \"Do you have any wishes how I may serve while I'm here?\" I always try to uphold this principle beyond any preferences of my own. In some temples I ask upon my arrival. But in temples such as Moscow, because it is such a big yatra and a place where I could potentially be pulled into many directions, I usually ask before I go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI will therefore first give my schedule for Moscow and I will then explain what I believe could happen in Kursk and Tomsk.

Since I expect that he will be in Moscow at some point during my visit there, I was planning to discuss it with him then. However, May 5th is Nrsimha Caturdasi and as I understand, it is also planned as the temple opening of our new temple in Kursk. Moreover it is my first visit to Kursk in probably more than ten years. And since I am a co-GBC in Kursk and the rest of Central Moscow Region where Nitai Caitanya Goswami is the Regional Secretary, and since Nitai Caitanya Goswami is generally inclined to approach me for assistance with the affairs of that yatra during my visits, it's possible I will be asked to take part in local and also regional concerns during some of the other three days that I will be there. Of course, I will still also give classes on most days of my visit, but I do not know to whom I will be speaking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n Tomsk:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince tickets have not been booked to Tomsk yet, it's difficult to say right now what my schedule will be while I'm there. It's quite possible that it will be a late-night flight to Tomsk on the 8th and a morning return flight on the 12th, which will leave me approximately 2.5 days in Tomsk. But my schedule for Tomsk will not be known until Madana-mohana discusses it with Sadhu Swami some time later this month.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHare Krsna<br />\r\n<br />\r\n</span></span></p>",

And since I am a co-GBC in Kursk and the rest of Central Moscow Region where Nitai Caitanya Goswami is the Regional Secretary, and since Nitai Caitanya Goswami is generally inclined to approach me for assistance with the affairs of that yatra during my visits, it's possible I will be asked to take part in local and also regional concerns during some of the other three days that I will be there. Of course, I will still also give classes on most days of my visit, but I do not know to whom I will be speaking.</p>\n<p> Tomsk:</p>\n<p>Since tickets have not been booked to Tomsk yet, it's difficult to say right now what my schedule will be while I'm there. It's quite possible that it will be a late-night flight to Tomsk on the 8th and a morning return flight on the 12th, which will leave me approximately 2.5 days in Tomsk. But my schedule for Tomsk will not be known until Madana-mohana discusses it with Sadhu Swami some time later this month.</p>\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\n<p></p>\n",

Both of us arrived here March 6th to take part in the Gaura Purnima celebrations on March 8th and then to rest from March 9th to March 18th. My health has not been good for quite some time and Devamrita Swami is presently recovering from extensive oral surgery. So when Madana-mohana suggested a good, quiet place for me to rest, knowing that Devamrita Swami was also recovering at this time and also knowing that he was not so far away, I invited him to stay along with us.  Although this time has been posted on my itinerary as a \"health retreat\", for the most part, I've been simply resting and reading.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">We celebrated Gaura Purnima at one of our temples in Denpasar (there are five temples in Bali) and now we are staying about 1.5 – 2 hours from Denpasar in the small village of Candidasa.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">We both had a wonderful Gaura Purnima celebration with the devotees from Bali. Approximately 300 devotees attended the festival which included abhiseka, bhajans, talks from myself and Devamrita Swami, and then arati. There was a short drama after arati, but unfortunately, it was already late and since we had to drive back to Candidasa after the program, Devamrita Swami and I decided to break our fast after arati and return to our residence.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">On the way back to Candidasa, the local Temple President, Padmalocana dasa, told us that if we would go out on harinama with them on Sunday, we could expect at least 200 devotees to participate. I asked how often they go out on harinama. He said that at least 30 devotees go out every day. Each day of the week they have a special spot they go to in order to give maximum exposure of the Lord's Holy Names to all the residents of the Bali. Padmalocana said that on Sunday, they would be going to the beach and lots of people would be there.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">Although it would be another long drive, I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to go out on harinama, so I agreed to go. I definitely didn't regret it. It was a wonderful experience to see the enthusiasm the devotees had for harinama. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">When Madana-mohana and I arrived, it was already 5:00 PM. All the devotees were sitting on the beach, chanting with harmonium, mrdangas and kartalas. But shortly thereafter, everyone lined up for harinama down the beach. I asked for someone else to lead for awhile and chanted along with them. But after 20 minutes or so, they asked if I would lead. I then led for about an hour and then another devotee led while we returned to our orginal spot.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">Madana-mohana took at least 20 video clips of the harinama. A few of them have been posted here, but I'm not sure how much they show the enthusiastic participation of the local people as well as the foreigners who are in Bali for their vacation. It was especially enlivening to see the local Muslims sincerely chanting and dancing along with the kirtan.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">These days, more and more, I am marveling upon Srila Prabhupada's compassion, desire, and potency to attract conditioned souls onto the path of devotional service and back home back to Godhead. One morning, in Mayapura, I experienced this overwhelming sensation during Guru Puja. I was standing right in front of Srila Prabhupada, looking very intently upon him, while very long lines of devotees were, one by one, offering flower petals to his lotus feet. I reflected on my memories of him sitting and accepting Guru Puja in Mayapura in 1976. Remembering the pleased look I saw on his face while he watched all his disciples chanting and dancing before him, and then seeing the long lines of devotees from cultures all over the world, now worshiping him and offering petals to his lotus feet, my eyes welled up with tears, thinking how wonderful and satisfying it is to take part in the service of introducing souls to those two beautiful lotus feet. It is hard to fully comprehend how fortunate we are to be associated with service to his divine lotus feet. But seeing Krsna consciousness manifesting all over the world, is no doubt, an impetus to remember and to reflect on our good fortune.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">Hare Krsna.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gE0xt7Ge0uU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \"> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \"> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xd0aL-h9NiI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></span></span></p>",

I reflected on my memories of him sitting and accepting Guru Puja in Mayapura in 1976. Remembering the pleased look I saw on his face while he watched all his disciples chanting and dancing before him, and then seeing the long lines of devotees from cultures all over the world, now worshiping him and offering petals to his lotus feet, my eyes welled up with tears, thinking how wonderful and satisfying it is to take part in the service of introducing souls to those two beautiful lotus feet. It is hard to fully comprehend how fortunate we are to be associated with service to his divine lotus feet. But seeing Krsna consciousness manifesting all over the world, is no doubt, an impetus to remember and to reflect on our good fortune.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \">Hare Krsna.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \"></span></span></p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gE0xt7Ge0uU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \"> </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \"> </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; \"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; \"></span></span></p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xd0aL-h9NiI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p></p>\n",

Unfortunately, while in Mayapura, I was much too busy to write any blogs. And although several lectures have been recently given and many kirtans were recorded in Mayapura, there was no internet connection available to transfer the files.</p>\r\n<p>The GBC meetings kept me very busy from February 10 -21, and then the Kirtan-mela went from February 22 – 25. I averaged five hours/day in the the Kirtan-mela kirtans. The rest of my time from February 10th onwards, was spent meeting devotees during lunch every day, visiting devotees, and dealing with GBC-related matters assigned to me by a GBC committee. </p>\r\n<p>Once the Kirtan-mela was over, I met personally with many devotees, I gave two evening classes, and continued with my GBC committee work which continues even up until today. Although I was scheduled to leave Mayapura on February 27th, due to the many commitments which remained after the Kirtan-mela was over, I was unable to make it for the first two days of the Govardhan Asram Japa Retreat, where I was scheduled to speak daily on the topic of \"Appreciating the Association of the Holy Name.\"</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, on March 1st, my evening flight from Kolkata to Mumbai was delayed three hours. When I arrived in Mumbai it was almost 1:00 in the morning. I was therefore unable to make it to Govardhan Asram in time for the first of two classes devotees were hoping to hear from me on that day. By the time I arrived in Govardhan Asram, there was only enough time for a two-hour class, which begain at 2:00 PM, with an additional hour of questions and kirtans. Still, it was a very wonderful retreat (see photo at http://govardhanashram.com/). More than sixty devotees from Pune and Mumbai registered for the three-day retreat. They all seemed very grateful that I was able to make it at all.</p>\r\n<p>Govardhan Asrama has developed very nicely since my last visit one year ago. There are very nice and comfortable guest quarters for up to one hundred guests. Just before I left Govardhan Asram today, two busloads of devotees from Pune had just arrived for a weekend retreat. So when Gauranga Prabhu asked if I would delay my departure for a couple of more hours to speak and have kirtan with the arriving devotees, I immediately agreed. I left Govardhan Asrama at 3:30 and arrived here in Radha Gopinath Mandir at approximately 6:00 PM.</p>\r\n<p>Tomorrow, Bhakti Caitanya Swami and I will give the Sunday Feast lecture together here at Radha Gopinath Mandir. Maharaja is scheduled to arrive this evening and will be here all day tomorrow. Monday, I hope to visit all the sincere Vaisnavas at Bhaktivedanta Hospital, and then Monday night I will move on to my next destination. </p>\r\n<p>This afternoon Madana-mohana called me and informed me that somewhere between 150 – 200 devotees are planning to take part in a large harinama in the city on Gaura Purnima day. I very much look forward to that.</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully, my schedule will soon normalize and I will begin to post blogs from time to time once again. There are at least five lectures which need to be uploaded, and all the kirtans from Kirtan-mela are also ready to be uploaded. I'm not sure when everything will be posted, but hopefully many files will be coming very soon.</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>",

It probably deserves some explanation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis trip to the United States became exceptionally busy when, during some testing in New York, the doctors discovered a major increase of my blood pressure. I then had to balance all of my already-existing commitments throughout the Northeast with no less than four, two-hour and sometimes four-hour trips to Upstate New York, usually spending at least one night in New York and then returning back to Boston and/or Hartford. All these tests and consultations had to be scheduled in New York with doctors who have been overseeing some of my medical issues for the past several years. Therefore all my lectures, programs, meetings, and other commitments had to be scheduled around these doctor appointments. It got so hectic towards the end of my visit to the U.S. that I had to cancel my visit to Ottawa, Ontario in order to finish everything in time for my departure on January 13th.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI wish to thank Mayapura Chandra dasa, one of the doctors in New York, who arranged all of these details for me and who never failed to call me every single day over a period of at least 3-4 weeks to check and to see if my blood pressure was coming down to acceptable levels. Mayapura Chandra and his entire family including his parents, his wife and two children, his four brothers, along with their wives and children, are all very dedicated and sincere devotees. They all live together in one home in Upstate New York. It is a pleasure to stay with them in their home and to see how they have put Krsna in the center of their lives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter finishing with my travels and finalizing how to best deal with these medical issues, I then was able to follow through with a Brooklyn studio recording I had scheduled for January 10-12 some time back in early December. Since this endeavor included the participation of many other devotees, some traveling from as far as Florida, I did not want to cancel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy Krsna's grace, I was able to keep that commitment with the help of Syamakunda dasa, Anandarupa devi dasi, Hrsikesa dasa, Sukhesvari devi dasi, and Dina Gauranga dasa. They all helped in many ways by taking care of all the backup arrangements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother reason why I was so intent on keeping my commitment to do this recording is because I pledged to use all the proceeds from the sale of the CD for helping Manorama dasa, the devotee who has been overseeing the Youth Bus Tour in North America for so many years. Please see their website at http://www.krishna.com/bustour. It is definitely a project worth supporting and everyone who participated felt good about our goal to support it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany excellent and wonderful kirtaniyas took part in this recording and I wish to thank them all for their enthusiastic participation. My godbrother Purusartha dasa came from Alachua and also coordinated everyone else who took part in the recordings. Ananta Govinda dasa came from Brooklyn, Acyuta Gopi devi dasi came from Brooklyn, Krsna Kishora dasa came from Alachua, and Akincana Krsna dasa and Rati Manjari dd who, though both currently live in India, were, by Krsna's grace, visiting Brooklyn at the time. Some pictures taken in the recording studio will probably be posted here in the Photo Gallery soon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere was probably at least 120 minutes of recording time. We are hoping for at least 9-10 tracks on the CD. Not only did I lead some of the kirtans and bhajans, but kirtans were also led by Ananta Govinda, Acyuta Gopi, Krsna Kishora and and Akincana Krsna. Hrsikesa dasa will be doing all the mixing and mastering in his spare time. So although we would all like to see this CD available as soon as possible, realistically we will likely not see it until some time around the middle of this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe day after our recording I flew from Newark, New Jersey to Budapest. I arrived on the 14th late afternoon, exhausted and with jet lag, and yesterday I had to finish the latest deadline on the revised paper I had written for the GBC. I worked almost all day yesterday from 4:30 AM until 2:00 AM this morning, the time when I finally submitted my work to the GBC committee overseeing the paper. So today is the first day in weeks that I've actually had a little time to write.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tI have an unlimited amount of correspondence to work on. Still, in the days to follow, I will try my best to contribute more to this blog.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n",

				"value": "<p>There are some devotees who may wonder why I never lead Tulasi-kirtana in Ukraine, especially in Kiev. The answer lies in the Tulasi-kirtana recording which has been posted in the audio section today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the years I have made several unsuccessful attempts to teach the devotees in Kiev the proper melody for Tulasi-kirtana. The irregularity of the melody chanted in Kiev (though not only in Kiev) is not extreme, or at least it's not as extreme as the irregularity of the Sri Guru Vandana prayers used to be. Nonetheless the way that Tulasi-kirtana is chanted there is still an irregularity which could be corrected if more effort was made to correct it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe irregularity comes on the last two or three words of the last line of each verse as indicated below. Please listen to the recording while reading along with the prayers, and take note of the way the words \"ei abhilasi\", \"vrndavana-vasi\", \"yugala-rupa-rasi\", \"koro-nija-dasi\", and \"sada yena bhasi\" are chanted. If you listen to my version and then listen to what is chanted generally everywhere throughout Ukraine, you will see what I am talking about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy intention of this posting is not to give this as ammunition to my readers to become faultfinders of those who do chant the Tulasi-kirtana improperly.

				"safe_value": "<p>There are some devotees who may wonder why I never lead Tulasi-kirtana in Ukraine, especially in Kiev. The answer lies in the Tulasi-kirtana recording which has been posted in the audio section today.</p>\n<p>Over the years I have made several unsuccessful attempts to teach the devotees in Kiev the proper melody for Tulasi-kirtana. The irregularity of the melody chanted in Kiev (though not only in Kiev) is not extreme, or at least it's not as extreme as the irregularity of the Sri Guru Vandana prayers used to be. Nonetheless the way that Tulasi-kirtana is chanted there is still an irregularity which could be corrected if more effort was made to correct it.</p>\n<p>The irregularity comes on the last two or three words of the last line of each verse as indicated below. Please listen to the recording while reading along with the prayers, and take note of the way the words \"ei abhilasi\", \"vrndavana-vasi\", \"yugala-rupa-rasi\", \"koro-nija-dasi\", and \"sada yena bhasi\" are chanted. If you listen to my version and then listen to what is chanted generally everywhere throughout Ukraine, you will see what I am talking about.</p>\n<p>My intention of this posting is not to give this as ammunition to my readers to become faultfinders of those who do chant the Tulasi-kirtana improperly. I humbly ask that you do not use it in that way.

				"value": "<p>The following is a transcription of Sivarama Swami's short podcast, posted yesterday, December 3rd on www.sivaramaswami.com. It has been transcribed and posted here to make all of my readers aware of the serious situation in Hungary, especially the ominous threat against New Vraja Dhama. Please read it and then sign the online petition, which can be found by clicking on the designated link. We hope that this short transcription will be translated promptly into Russian. Soon we will also be posting a translation of the actual petition.</p>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<p>Today I'd like to talk about a subject that I had mentioned before: the change of church laws in Hungary. It's a topic I brought up in July, something that we keep on the agenda in the form of a campaign, something that we request listeners to also participate and to help in. </p>\r\n<p>But let me first give you a little summary in brief.</p>\r\n<p>In July the Hungarian government submitted a draft law to the Parliament on religious organizations, or as we call them here, churches. According to the draft law, the “churches” in Hungary, over 300 of them, were going to be classified into three different categories. Those that had been in Hungary for hundreds of years were in category one, those who are recognized world religions, like us, in category two. And then other “new” religions in category three. Those who did not fit in either would lose their church status. It wasn’t ideal, but it was acceptable. The declared purpose of this was to weed out businesses that work under the name of religion. </p>\r\n<p>Anyway, what ended up happening in July was that arbitrarily 14 churches that had been in existence in Hungary and recognized in a law dated 1895 were recognized as existing religious organizations and they would continue to function in the same way in the future while everyone else would lose their church status at the end of this year and would have to transform into religious associations and then reapply for their church status which needed a two-thirds majority vote of parliament.</p>\r\n<p>Obviously this wasn't favorable. First of all, there was no particular reason for taking away the church status of churches in good standing, including us, who are the fourth most popular church in Hungary. It also very much affects rights-- like for instance, if you are not a church you don't have tax exemption. It also means your automatic rights to book distribution aren't guaranteed. It means that, for instance, the government subsidy that we get for our gurukula and for our theological college are lost. If you're not a church, you cannot have a theological college. All of these things would cease, including the one percent of personal income tax allocated by our supporters on an annual basis.</p>\r\n<p>Over the period of the last four or five months, we were working on a premise that the existing law would be amended. It needed to be amended because it was messy and on the basis of that amendment, government people said, we were going to be included together with the other original world religions. </p>\r\n<p>Recently it has come to our notice that there's going to be no amendment of that law this year, rather, it will go into effect on January 1st as it is now and everyone, including us, will have to apply for re-registration.</p>\r\n<p>We haven't been sitting around. We've been moving energies, devotees, contacts, on a global level-- Europe, India, America, and locally in Hungary. In fact it's been a full time job for quite a few devotees, taking them away from other services. And one very important thing is, which is going to be the centerpiece of what I am talking about now, is a certain way in which that law actually affects specifically us. </p>\r\n<p>Unlike any of the other churches in Hungary, we have got agricultural land. And existing land laws state that associations cannot hold land, which means that at the present time, between now and the end of the year, we need some kind of clarification as to what happens to our land come January the 1st. By land we mean 200 hectares or about 500 acres of New Vraja Dhama's pasturing grounds and agricultural land. We don't expect that the government is going to come and take it away, still, there's been no particular law or arrangement made that actually deals with what happens to Krsna Valley's agricultural lands from January 1st  to the time when we are again accepted as a church. That makes the situation of the land is precarious.</p>\r\n<p>A religious association, not being a church, which is what we would be on January 1st, cannot legally hold agricultural land. It can hold other types of land, like town property and so on. But not agricultural land. So some type of amendment has to be made.</p>\r\n<p>Of course we've seen many politicians and when they wake up to the reality of the situation then they say, \"Well of course, obviously something has to be done.\" The issue is that time is running out and nothing has been done. </p>\r\n<p>So now we are focusing on our campaign and this is where everyone else comes in. We are bringing this to the public view that our cows don't have a future starting January 1. Are they able to continue grazing on the land? What is the status of their land? What is the status of our self-sufficient community which is based on the fact that we grow our own food? This needs to be settled.</p>\r\n<p>So we are bringing this into the forefront. For that reason we are doing a leaflet campaign and a petition. On December 13th we are going to be outside of the parliament with cows and devotees and kirtan in order to bring this to the attention of the general public as well as of the members of parliament. We will be handing over a petition also to the Parliament to communicate that there is an unresolved problem. They’ve got their church law, but they still have got this loophole that needs to be addressed and we need our lands protected in that regard. </p>\r\n<p>So how can the devotees here on this podcast help? We are having an online petition at <a href=\"http://www.petitions24.com/krisna\">http://www.petitions24.com/krisna</a>, and we request everyone to sign on to that petition. Moreover if every listener also gets ten other people, to sign on, and they, in turn, to get ten more people—all the better. We're really trying to get lots and lots of signatories, as many as we can to hand over to the government, to show them that this is not just a national concern, but it is an international  concern. We need signatories from Russia, from India, from South America, from South Africa, from Asia, from Canada, from Alaska, from the South Pole. Anywhere, anyone listening. Or wherever you know someone, please ask them to just get on the site and do that.</p>\r\n<p>And we are quite sure that some type of arrangement will be forthcoming. Of course, the easiest arrangement is if the government recognizes our right, \"We better give them their church rights back and make some kind of amendment for that.\" That automatically takes care of the land problem. If they don't do that but want us to continue by putting in our application on January 1st, then they have to make some kind of amendment to the land law or to pass some kind of other special law, that deals with this particular issue.</p>\r\n<p>So this is what the petition says: \"Please, you have to deal with this. This is the biggest self-sufficient community in Europe-- Hindu community, Krishna conscious community-- and it really needs the attention of the Hungarian government.”</p>\r\n<p>I am not going to deal with the other problems like 1% tax allocation, college status etc. just now. This is the most important thing that we need to deal with because this isn't addressed. With the other things at least we know where we stand. With the land we don't know where we stand. And by making it very public and by getting the voice and the backing of many people, then no doubt the government will actually do something. Most likely, their intention would be to do something, but they also have a whole bunch of other things to worry about that is distracting them.</p>\r\n<p>All right. Thank you very much and look for the link. Hare Krishna.</p>",

				"value": "<p>Three days ago I met with a devotee in Budapest. In the course of our discussion I recalled an unforgettable experience I had about thirty-six years ago when I was a brahmacari and was regularly distributing books for the Boston temple. I remember telling this story before, but I can't remember when and where I might have told it.  I thought I would repeat it here since it seemed to make a positive impression on the devotee I told, especially  in light of the experiences this devotee had prior to coming to speak with me.</p>\r\n<p>Some time in early 1975, my godbrother and Temple President, Trai Prabhu, left Boston to join the Radha Damodara Traveling Sankiran Party. Soon thereafter another devotee was sent by our GBC to replace him. I will not mention his name because there is no need.</p>\r\n<p>Right from the time of his arrival, this new president seemed very strict with everyone living in the temple. I did not know why, but I remembered thinking that maybe it was because he thought that Trai Prabhu was too lenient with all of us. Although he was a householder, he seemed especially strict with the brahmacaris. </p>\r\n<p>It wasn't long after he became president, I started to notice that he would oftentimes insult me in public even though he had previously authorized me to be the Sankirtan Leader for all of the brahmacaris. For some time I just accepted it as training for my new position. I even began thinking that it was also his way of showing his affection for me. </p>\r\n<p>Gradually, however, I couldn't accept it as easily as I was able to when he first came. I remember trying hard to not defend myself. Neither would I try or even think of avenging myself. I also never talked about it with anyone. I just kept on letting it bottle up within me until it started getting to the point when I thought I would not be able to tolerate it any more.</p>\r\n<p>It was right around that time that I distinctly remember being asked to give Srimad Bhagavatam class in the temple a lot more than I had been giving before. I believe it was because I had returned to the temple from traveling sankirtan and I was asked to stay back at the temple indefinitely in order to oversee all of the Sankirtan parties. On traveling sankirtan, I would give Srimad Bhagavatam class every day to the devotees on my book distribution party, but I would usually give only one Srimad Bhagavatam class in the temple whenever our party returned. On that particular week, I had given at least three consecutive Srimad Bhagavatam classes, all from the chapter, \"The Discussion Between Jada Bharata and Maharaja Rahugana\", in the Fifth Canto.</p>\r\n<p>The verses Krsna arranged for me to speak from were all verses about the criticisms and insults Maharaja Rahugana hurled at Jada Bharata for inconveniencing him by the way Jada Bharata was carrying his palanquin. And Srila Prabhupada's purports were all about how to become free from the influence of insult. The verses couldn't have been any more directly related to all that I was going through. </p>\r\n<p>I do not remember the reason, but the temple president was not present for any of the classes I gave that week. I therefore felt more free to speak according to the realizations which came to me from my own experiences, although I never once mentioned the particulars about what I was going through at the time.  The most vivid memories I have from giving those classes was the sheltered feeling I got by accepting everything that was happening to me— specifically the insults and especially the opportunity to be speaking on those particular verses— as Krsna's direct arrangement. It was almost as if He was personally massaging my tormented heart with His hand as I was speaking whatever realizations that would come to me.</p>\r\n<p>However, another realization came to me as I was speaking that I did not share with my audience in those classes.

				"safe_value": "<p>Three days ago I met with a devotee in Budapest. In the course of our discussion I recalled an unforgettable experience I had about thirty-six years ago when I was a brahmacari and was regularly distributing books for the Boston temple. I remember telling this story before, but I can't remember when and where I might have told it.  I thought I would repeat it here since it seemed to make a positive impression on the devotee I told, especially  in light of the experiences this devotee had prior to coming to speak with me.</p>\n<p>Some time in early 1975, my godbrother and Temple President, Trai Prabhu, left Boston to join the Radha Damodara Traveling Sankiran Party. Soon thereafter another devotee was sent by our GBC to replace him. I will not mention his name because there is no need.</p>\n<p>Right from the time of his arrival, this new president seemed very strict with everyone living in the temple. I did not know why, but I remembered thinking that maybe it was because he thought that Trai Prabhu was too lenient with all of us. Although he was a householder, he seemed especially strict with the brahmacaris. </p>\n<p>It wasn't long after he became president, I started to notice that he would oftentimes insult me in public even though he had previously authorized me to be the Sankirtan Leader for all of the brahmacaris. For some time I just accepted it as training for my new position. I even began thinking that it was also his way of showing his affection for me. </p>\n<p>Gradually, however, I couldn't accept it as easily as I was able to when he first came. I remember trying hard to not defend myself. Neither would I try or even think of avenging myself. I also never talked about it with anyone. I just kept on letting it bottle up within me until it started getting to the point when I thought I would not be able to tolerate it any more.</p>\n<p>It was right around that time that I distinctly remember being asked to give Srimad Bhagavatam class in the temple a lot more than I had been giving before. I believe it was because I had returned to the temple from traveling sankirtan and I was asked to stay back at the temple indefinitely in order to oversee all of the Sankirtan parties. On traveling sankirtan, I would give Srimad Bhagavatam class every day to the devotees on my book distribution party, but I would usually give only one Srimad Bhagavatam class in the temple whenever our party returned. On that particular week, I had given at least three consecutive Srimad Bhagavatam classes, all from the chapter, \"The Discussion Between Jada Bharata and Maharaja Rahugana\", in the Fifth Canto.</p>\n<p>The verses Krsna arranged for me to speak from were all verses about the criticisms and insults Maharaja Rahugana hurled at Jada Bharata for inconveniencing him by the way Jada Bharata was carrying his palanquin. And Srila Prabhupada's purports were all about how to become free from the influence of insult. The verses couldn't have been any more directly related to all that I was going through. </p>\n<p>I do not remember the reason, but the temple president was not present for any of the classes I gave that week. I therefore felt more free to speak according to the realizations which came to me from my own experiences, although I never once mentioned the particulars about what I was going through at the time.  The most vivid memories I have from giving those classes was the sheltered feeling I got by accepting everything that was happening to me— specifically the insults and especially the opportunity to be speaking on those particular verses— as Krsna's direct arrangement. It was almost as if He was personally massaging my tormented heart with His hand as I was speaking whatever realizations that would come to me.</p>\n<p>However, another realization came to me as I was speaking that I did not share with my audience in those classes. That realization was that my Temple President was none other than Krsna's representative, sent directly to deal with my false ego. So many mixed emotions welled up within me while I was speaking. I felt purified, elated, relieved, and especially grateful for everything that was happening to me. I even felt grateful that Krsna sent this devotee to be temple president and not somebody else, thinking that this arrangement may not have happened if the new president had been somebody different. </p>\n<p>Time passed, although I don't think it was very long.

But I did feel as though Krsna was preparing me for more that was still yet to come.</p>\n<p>About twenty-five years later I unexpectedly met this former Temple President in the course of my travels.

Madana-mohana dasa, who later that day met us at Madhumangala dasa's home, has a regular posting he does through something called Twitter. I'm not sure what that is and I've not seen any of his postings. However, a couple of months ago he did send me a link (http://twitter.com/#!/Following_NRS) and said that he was making regular postings there in Russian for devotees who use Twitter.</p>\r\n<p>So, early on the morning of October 15th, Agastya Muni dasa and I were met by Madhumangala dasa and Syama Gopal dasa and we were brought immediately to the home of Madhumangala dasa.

Shortly before they left, Sridama expressed a strong desire for me to attend the Sarad-Purnima program that evening at Radha Gopinath Mandir. He said that Radhanath Swami, Giriraja Swami and other devotees were also hoping I would come. I agreed and when I arrived I found at least 2,000 people both inside the temple and outside the temple listening attentively to Giriraja Swami's talk about the gopis' conversation with Krsna. For those who could not fit in the temple (the majority) video screens were set up for them to watch and listen to the lecture.</p>\r\n<p>After the lecture we all got a magnificent darshan of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, surrounded by Lalita, Visakha, and other gopis under the full moon. The atmosphere appeared as if it must have been non-different to the place where Krsna's rasa-lila took place along the banks of the Yamuna. Radhanath Swami then requested me to sit and lead kirtan, which I did, and then I stayed a little bit longer mainly because I had \"homework\" to do before the meetings started the following morning.</p>\r\n<p>There's more I could say about the week of the GBC meetings, but maybe some other time. Two days ago, Madana-mohana dasa, Syama Gopal dasa, Agastya Muni dasa and I flew to Delhi. I took lunch with Gopal Krsna Goswami in Delhi and shortly thereafter we drove to Govardhana, where I plan to stay for a little more than two weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Early this morning, Dhanurdhara Swami, Syama Gopal dasa, and Agastya Muni went on parikrama half-way around Govardhana Hill. While entering Aniyora, we were pleasantly surprised to see BB Govinda Swami, Sacinandana Swami, Srutakirti Prabhu, Madhava Prabhu, and several other devotees doing dandavat parikrama around Govardhana Hill. I had heard they were doing dandavat parikrama every other day for four hours in the morning, but I had no idea where and when they were doing it. We all exchanged obeisances and embraces, but since I could see that they were very absorbed in their vrata, we quickly continued on our parikrama through Govinda Kunda, punchari, and then along the inner path towards Govardhana village.</p>\r\n<p>Before continuing our \"walking\" parikrama, I asked Syama Gopal to take a few pictures with his smartphone of the devotees doing their dandavat parikrama.

			"Body_raw": {
				"value": "<p>I've been told that some devotees are wondering why I have not posted anything yet about the departure of our wonderful godbrother, Gopiparanadhana Prabhu. The explanation is this:</p>\r\n<p>I learned about Gopiparanadhana Prabhu's departure on the 15th morning while honoring breakfast prasadam with a few godbrothers. The 15th was also the last day of the Evpatoriya Festival and the first full day of meetings which approximately 25 devotees scheduled with me for the 15th and 16th. Naturally I was torn between these events, but I had to follow through with the meetings since so many devotees remained in Evpatoriya exclusively for that purpose.</p>\r\n<p>Gopiparanadhana Prabhu's departure was not only a shock to me but it was a shock to ISKCON's central nervous system. When I think of Gopiparanadhana Prabhu, I think of the one devotee in ISKCON upon whom all future Sanskrit translations would be resting upon. It's not that he was expected to translate all the works of the Goswamis himself (although he was certainly fully committed to his translation work). But Gopiparanadhana Prabhu was singlehandedly training future Sanskritists who would carry on the tradition of producing scholarly translations and commentary. He was a jewel among Vaisnava scholars and was deeply committed to carrying on the tradition of translating and commenting in the same mood as Srila Prabhupada.</p>\r\n<p>If fact whenever I refer to the Brhad-Bhagavatamrita, I repeatedly state that, although so many books have been translated since Srila Prabhupada's departure, this translation and commentary of Brhad-Bhagavatamrita is the one book that I can read, quote, and meditate upon with the same confidence as if Srila Prabhupada had translated it and commented upon it himself. I was so much looking forward to reading Gopiparanadhana Prabhu's work on the Sandarbhas by Srila Jiva Goswami. I cannot imagine how this work will continue without him.</p>\r\n<p>It is very rare in this world to find someone who is so scholarly and so humble at the same time. Gopiparanadhana Prabhu embodied both qualities like no other Vaisnava I've ever known. Both his scholarship and his humility were profound. He was not interested in position, recognition, and followers. Many years ago, I recall that even though many senior devotees worldwide were encouraging him to accept disciples, he was unwilling to take even the slightest initiative to be recognized as a spiritual master. For years, he simply continued to translate, preach, teach, and serve in a way which was most natural for him. His mood was that if ISKCON wanted him to accept disciples, then someone else would have to take the initiative. He was not at all interested in promoting himself as anything other than Srila Prabhupada's servant. And even though he was recognized several years ago as a disciple of Srila Prabhupada fit to serve as a spiritual master, his temperament never changed in the least.</p>\r\n<p>I remember earlier this year I learned that Gopiparanadhana Prabhu had a conference called \"Questions and Answers.\" The same day I learned that the conference existed, I immediately enrolled in his conference. My thoughts at the time were that if somebody was going to be asking questions related to sastra, Gopiparanadhana Prabhu would give answers I could count on for their authenticity. The mere thought that there was a repository of such questions and answers enlivened me so much that I immediately downloaded every question and answer in the whole conference. I'm now left to wonder, \"Where will everyone who was asking now go for their answers?\"</p>\r\n<p>A little less than three months ago, when I was flying out of Moscow, I was informed in the airport that Gopiparanadhana Prabhu was transiting Sheremetyevo Airport at the same time. I immediately changed course and asked the devotees to take me to see him. I was surprised to see him dressed in Western clothes, since I had never seen him dressed that way before. But I quickly learned that he was on his way to China to preach. We embraced, and we sat down together to talk for about 20 minutes. I was eagerly inquiring from him about his translation work and was asking when we could expect his next book to be published. Gopiparanadhana Prabhu was his usual self— unassuming, jolly, and informative. It was a pleasure to be with him, but unfortunately, it has now turned into the last time I will get the opportunity to be with him here in this world.</p>\r\n<p>Although I have not been able to write anything about Gopiparanadhana Prabhu until now, I have talked about Gopiparanadhana Prabhu with many over the course of the last three days. Without exception, every senior Vaisnava I have spoken with has reacted the same way about his departure. They were both sad at the loss of such a great soul, but happy to hear that he left his body in Govardhana, the very place where he wanted to always remain. Although I pray that he has entered into Radha Syamasundara's pastimes, deep down within me there is a strong, confident feeling that he is already there.</p>\r\n<p>Gopiparanadhana Prabhu ki jaya!</p>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://nrs.iskconboston.org/sites/default/files/Bannerzest/Gopiparanadhana/bzLoader.js\"></script><noscript><p style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;padding:1em;\">Your browser doesn't support JavaScript or you have disabled JavaScript.</p></noscript>\r\n<div id=\"SWBZ190C5371D723470EB95B\"> </div>\r\n<div id=\"LKBZ190C5371D723470EB95B\"> </div>",

When I think of Gopiparanadhana Prabhu, I think of the one devotee in ISKCON upon whom all future Sanskrit translations would be resting upon. It's not that he was expected to translate all the works of the Goswamis himself (although he was certainly fully committed to his translation work). But Gopiparanadhana Prabhu was singlehandedly training future Sanskritists who would carry on the tradition of producing scholarly translations and commentary. He was a jewel among Vaisnava scholars and was deeply committed to carrying on the tradition of translating and commenting in the same mood as Srila Prabhupada.</p>\n<p>If fact whenever I refer to the Brhad-Bhagavatamrita, I repeatedly state that, although so many books have been translated since Srila Prabhupada's departure, this translation and commentary of Brhad-Bhagavatamrita is the one book that I can read, quote, and meditate upon with the same confidence as if Srila Prabhupada had translated it and commented upon it himself. I was so much looking forward to reading Gopiparanadhana Prabhu's work on the Sandarbhas by Srila Jiva Goswami. I cannot imagine how this work will continue without him.</p>\n<p>It is very rare in this world to find someone who is so scholarly and so humble at the same time. Gopiparanadhana Prabhu embodied both qualities like no other Vaisnava I've ever known. Both his scholarship and his humility were profound. He was not interested in position, recognition, and followers. Many years ago, I recall that even though many senior devotees worldwide were encouraging him to accept disciples, he was unwilling to take even the slightest initiative to be recognized as a spiritual master. For years, he simply continued to translate, preach, teach, and serve in a way which was most natural for him. His mood was that if ISKCON wanted him to accept disciples, then someone else would have to take the initiative. He was not at all interested in promoting himself as anything other than Srila Prabhupada's servant. And even though he was recognized several years ago as a disciple of Srila Prabhupada fit to serve as a spiritual master, his temperament never changed in the least.</p>\n<p>I remember earlier this year I learned that Gopiparanadhana Prabhu had a conference called \"Questions and Answers.\" The same day I learned that the conference existed, I immediately enrolled in his conference. My thoughts at the time were that if somebody was going to be asking questions related to sastra, Gopiparanadhana Prabhu would give answers I could count on for their authenticity. The mere thought that there was a repository of such questions and answers enlivened me so much that I immediately downloaded every question and answer in the whole conference. I'm now left to wonder, \"Where will everyone who was asking now go for their answers?\"</p>\n<p>A little less than three months ago, when I was flying out of Moscow, I was informed in the airport that Gopiparanadhana Prabhu was transiting Sheremetyevo Airport at the same time. I immediately changed course and asked the devotees to take me to see him. I was surprised to see him dressed in Western clothes, since I had never seen him dressed that way before. But I quickly learned that he was on his way to China to preach. We embraced, and we sat down together to talk for about 20 minutes. I was eagerly inquiring from him about his translation work and was asking when we could expect his next book to be published. Gopiparanadhana Prabhu was his usual self— unassuming, jolly, and informative. It was a pleasure to be with him, but unfortunately, it has now turned into the last time I will get the opportunity to be with him here in this world.</p>\n<p>Although I have not been able to write anything about Gopiparanadhana Prabhu until now, I have talked about Gopiparanadhana Prabhu with many over the course of the last three days. Without exception, every senior Vaisnava I have spoken with has reacted the same way about his departure. They were both sad at the loss of such a great soul, but happy to hear that he left his body in Govardhana, the very place where he wanted to always remain. Although I pray that he has entered into Radha Syamasundara's pastimes, deep down within me there is a strong, confident feeling that he is already there.</p>\n<p>Gopiparanadhana Prabhu ki jaya!</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://nrs.iskconboston.org/sites/default/files/Bannerzest/Gopiparanadhana/bzLoader.js\"></script><p></p><noscript><br /><p style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;padding:1em;\">Your browser doesn't support JavaScript or you have disabled JavaScript.</p>\n<p></p></noscript>\n<div id=\"SWBZ190C5371D723470EB95B\"> </div>\n<div id=\"LKBZ190C5371D723470EB95B\"> </div>\n",

All glories to your divine grace!</p>\r\n<p>Recently I was with a dear godbrother who told me a story about you I never heard before. For my offering to you today, I would like to repeat the story he told, combined with an additional short story of how it was told. By so doing, I wish to show, once again, the power of your purity and the impact it has in the hearts of those who come in contact with you.</p>\r\n<p>Last month I spent an evening with this devotee in the home of two of your spiritual grandchildren, both of whom love you very much and are always eager to hear everything they can about you. They cooked a wonderful meal, offered it to their home Deities and then the three of us— your disciple, his wife, and myself, sat down to honor the remnants.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the meal, your disciple was asked by one of his hosts, \"Please, please, tell us something about Srila Prabhupada.\" Out of humility, he was reluctant to speak. But by the way he was asked, it quickly became obvious to him that it was not going to be an easy request to refuse. So he proceeded to narrate a few anecdotes he remembered from his association with you, one of which had a very deep impression on me.</p>\r\n<p>He had been developing an uncharted region in Europe for your pleasure. By so doing, he was able to inspire you to come and to also preach there. He went on to describe to us the efforts he made to arrange meetings for you with as many dignitaries there as he could gather to meet with you. One particular dignitary was not as easy to convince as the others, but in due course of time, he agreed and said that he would be happy to meet you.</p>\r\n<p>While describing these arrangements he made for your preaching, I was reminded of stories told, just one week earlier in Moscow, by your disciple and former secretary, Syamasundara Prabhu. He was relating his experiences with you to a large gathering of devotees on just how intense it was to be responsible for organizing your preaching engagements. He said that in 1971, after your meeting with Professor Kotovsky, he could not imagine how you would be able to tolerate the remaining three days in Moscow with no other preaching engagement. He knew well the intensity of your desire to give Krsna consciousness to others and that put a lot of pressure on him to find someone to whom you could preach—a task not so easy in Moscow in 1971, especially since preaching there was not only prohibited but also quite risky. He then went on to describe how he found someone on the street for you to preach to, and how you spent the following two days injecting as much Krsna consciousness into this person as he could absorb so that he could carry on your mission in the Soviet Empire.</p>\r\n<p>The circumstances in Western Europe were not quite the same. But the pressure to find people who would be willing to hear from you seemed like it was. This devotee wanted you to meet the most important people he could convince to hear from you and he was ready to undergo whatever austerity required to bring them to your lotus feet.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately I cannot remember the position held by this particular gentlemen who finally agreed to meet you. All I can remember is that he was quite influential. He came at the designated time for his meeting with you, he was then greeted and escorted into your simple quarters. He humbly sat down on the floor in front of you, and then you immediately asked him if he had any questions. \"No,\" was his quick reply. Your disciple was both crestfallen and shocked.  He knew that his spiritual master wanted to preach, it seemed, with the same conviction that Syamasundara Prabhu had. He was dejected, feeling he had let you down by bringing a disinterested guest unwilling to ask you even one question. </p>\r\n<p>But it seemed you weren't bothered at all. You turned to your disciple and humbly requested, \"Can you please bring me the harmonium?\" Perfectly calm and totally unconcerned about social convention, you deftly began playing a devotional melody and then began chanting as if only you and Krsna were present. After some time, your disciple was staring at your guest. He was patiently sitting, listening attentively, and from his facial expression it seemed to your disciple as if he was being transported into another dimension, almost as if he was preparing himself to come join you and Krsna. Although he did not keep time, your disciple remembered that you continued chanting for quite a long time—at least twenty minutes—and he could see that you were completely absorbed as if in a trance. Finally you stopped, came back into their presence, looked up at your guest, and with an innocent look on your face, you said to your guest, \"This is what we do.\" And that was it. That was your meeting. No questions were ever asked but all answers were given.</p>\r\n<p>You then turned to your disciple and said, \"Please give him some prasadam,\" and the story ended right there. But the memories of you did not and neither did the feelings of separation. Although your disciple was there, in front of me, it seemed he was also with you, almost as if he was hearing that same call you made to your guest while you were chanting. By that time profuse tears were gliding down the face of your disciple as he was recollecting those precious moments in your divine association. </p>\r\n<p>It was contagious. Seeing his tears and his intense attachment to you, I also couldn't contain myself and my eyes welled up with tears too. Unlike my godbrother who continued to sit motionless in remembrance of you, I excused myself for a minute while I went into the other room to wipe the tears from my eyes.</p>\r\n<p>When I returned, your disciple was still sitting there, still indifferent to the tears streaming down his cheeks. Recognizing his deep attachment to you, and probably also wanting to break what seemed like a long silence, our host then asked your disciple what was the most outstanding quality in you which attracted him to you. He immediately answered, \"Srila Prabhupada was authentic.\" </p>\r\n<p>In a world of hypocrisy, you, Srila Prabhupada, were the most authentic person he ever encountered in his entire life. And how that rings true, Srila Prabhupada, to all of us too.</p>\r\n<p>On this most auspicious day of your divine appearance, I humbly prostrate myself before your divine lotus feet, and I beg you, Srila Prabhupada, please always let me stay in the association of those devotees who worship your lotus feet as the the most authentic medium for Krsna's mercy.  I beg you to please also call me to join you, and to join all of them too (as it seems that so many are already answering your call) wherever you may be and whenever you consider me fit to remain,</p>\r\n<p>Your eternal servant,</p>\r\n<p>Niranjana Swami</p>",

				"value": "<p>I apologize to my blog readers for the long lapse of time since my last posting. The situation is simply this… I just haven't had the time. </p>\r\n<p>Now that I'm traveling more, it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to balance my priorities. Madana-mohana dasa certainly helps to streamline my day so that I can keep more of my priorities in focus. Still, as I continue to travel, a lot also depends upon the number of new commitments that accummulate from one day to the next. </p>\r\n<p>Moreover, when I'm in the United States, it's even more difficult. I'm more accessible to everyone here because everyone speaks English. When someone approaches, I can't say \"Izvinitye. Mnye nuzhen perevodchik. Pogovoritye c' Madana-mohanom shtobi naznachit vstrechu.\" [\"Sorry. I need a translator. Speak with Madana-mohan to schedule a meeting.\"] Of course, it would be nice if I didn't have to constantly say this in the CIS either. But since I have no choice, it does give me the option to at least organize my time a little bit better. [In this connection, some of  you may be happy to know that just yesterday, I pulled about ten of my old Russian books and textbooks out of my closet here in Boston, hoping to take them with me so that I can start spending more time with them in the future. For now, it's just a hope, but taking the books with me is a good start.] </p>\r\n<p>This last trip to Moscow and Lipetsk was wonderful for me. I was especially inspired by the mood of the 40th Anniversary celebration of Srila Prabhupada's visit to Moscow. I sincerely hope that similar events can be organized in the future. I will definitely attend. I could write more about my experiences in Moscow, but right now, time does not permit. If I can find time, I will write more about it in the future.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, I don't even have much time to write more about where I am and what I've been doing. I will have to be very brief, though I'll try to fill in more detail in the future. I've had some very inspiring encounters.</p>\r\n<p>From Moscow, I flew to Budapest for two days, rested, drove to Siofok to consult with my therapist, communicated with leaders from several countries, discussed details about the counselor system development in Hungary, and uploaded some of the material from the festival so that it could be posted here on the site. </p>\r\n<p>I then flew to California, rested from the 15-hour flight, and then spent four very satisfying days in the association of my dear godbrother, Giriraja Swami, and many other devotees living nearby, including my godbrother Syamasundara Prabhu (who flew back to California from Moscow the same day that I flew to California from Budapest), my godbrother, Nrsimhananda Prabhu and his wife (whose name is now Nitya Manjari devi dasi), Sarvatma Prabhu and his wife, Divyananda dasi, and Bhakta Karl (Tamal Krsna Goswami's brother) along with his wife, Stella, and their daughter, Irene. </p>\r\n<p>I then flew to Phoenix to spend one day with two very wonderful devotees I've known for many years. They formerly lived in Boston but reluctantly, they had to move almost three thousand miles away from the devotees they grew up with in Krsna consciousness.</p>\r\n<p>Again, practically the whole day of June 28th was spent flying from Phoenix, through San Francisco and then on to New Jersey. I spent most of both flights reading Giriraja Swami's recently-published, revised version of \"Watering the Seed.\"</p>\r\n<p>I spent time with my godbrother, Guru Gauranga dasa, on June 29th.

				"safe_value": "<p>I apologize to my blog readers for the long lapse of time since my last posting. The situation is simply this… I just haven't had the time. </p>\n<p>Now that I'm traveling more, it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to balance my priorities. Madana-mohana dasa certainly helps to streamline my day so that I can keep more of my priorities in focus. Still, as I continue to travel, a lot also depends upon the number of new commitments that accummulate from one day to the next. </p>\n<p>Moreover, when I'm in the United States, it's even more difficult. I'm more accessible to everyone here because everyone speaks English. When someone approaches, I can't say \"Izvinitye. Mnye nuzhen perevodchik. Pogovoritye c' Madana-mohanom shtobi naznachit vstrechu.\" [\"Sorry. I need a translator. Speak with Madana-mohan to schedule a meeting.\"] Of course, it would be nice if I didn't have to constantly say this in the CIS either. But since I have no choice, it does give me the option to at least organize my time a little bit better. [In this connection, some of  you may be happy to know that just yesterday, I pulled about ten of my old Russian books and textbooks out of my closet here in Boston, hoping to take them with me so that I can start spending more time with them in the future. For now, it's just a hope, but taking the books with me is a good start.] </p>\n<p>This last trip to Moscow and Lipetsk was wonderful for me. I was especially inspired by the mood of the 40th Anniversary celebration of Srila Prabhupada's visit to Moscow. I sincerely hope that similar events can be organized in the future. I will definitely attend. I could write more about my experiences in Moscow, but right now, time does not permit. If I can find time, I will write more about it in the future.</p>\n<p>In fact, I don't even have much time to write more about where I am and what I've been doing. I will have to be very brief, though I'll try to fill in more detail in the future. I've had some very inspiring encounters.</p>\n<p>From Moscow, I flew to Budapest for two days, rested, drove to Siofok to consult with my therapist, communicated with leaders from several countries, discussed details about the counselor system development in Hungary, and uploaded some of the material from the festival so that it could be posted here on the site. </p>\n<p>I then flew to California, rested from the 15-hour flight, and then spent four very satisfying days in the association of my dear godbrother, Giriraja Swami, and many other devotees living nearby, including my godbrother Syamasundara Prabhu (who flew back to California from Moscow the same day that I flew to California from Budapest), my godbrother, Nrsimhananda Prabhu and his wife (whose name is now Nitya Manjari devi dasi), Sarvatma Prabhu and his wife, Divyananda dasi, and Bhakta Karl (Tamal Krsna Goswami's brother) along with his wife, Stella, and their daughter, Irene. </p>\n<p>I then flew to Phoenix to spend one day with two very wonderful devotees I've known for many years. They formerly lived in Boston but reluctantly, they had to move almost three thousand miles away from the devotees they grew up with in Krsna consciousness.</p>\n<p>Again, practically the whole day of June 28th was spent flying from Phoenix, through San Francisco and then on to New Jersey. I spent most of both flights reading Giriraja Swami's recently-published, revised version of \"Watering the Seed.\"</p>\n<p>I spent time with my godbrother, Guru Gauranga dasa, on June 29th. It just so happened that he flew to the United States from Brazil just days before my arrival on the East Coast, and he was flying out from New Jersey to Germany on the June 30th. Our flights were timed perfectly so that we could meet in New Jersey. I was so happy to be with such a dear godbrother that in order to avoid losing time from his association, I accompanied Syamakunda dasa to pick him up from Newark and to bring him back to Newark as well. </p>\n<p>During his visit, Guru Gauranga Prabhu told a wonderful story about Srila Prabhupada that brought tears to everyone's eyes.

Such a mentality is an example of a lack of tolerance. We need someone to protect us from such a mentality, someone to help us become lower than the straw in the street. We certainly need to take shelter of a person who will deliver us from sinful motives.

What's a trip to Italy without pizza?</p>\r\n<p>We spent time talking, catching up on each other's activities since my last visit in October, 2008, and then we drove about 25 kilometers outside the city where Trai Prabhu and his wife, Krsnaloka devi dasi, are living. In order to avoid the high cost of living in the city, they decided to live outside the city and make the sacrifice of driving to and from Bologna, almost every day, to conduct their preaching programs.</p>\r\n<p>While chanting japa this morning, I looked out the window of my room and appreciated the beautiful, scenic countryside. Later in the morning, I pulled out a small video camera and shot a short video of the low-lying mountains and valleys just to the East of us.  While listening to the chirping birds and taking note of the budding trees, vines and flowers, I could not help but think of Krsna's words to Arjuna, aham rtunam kusumakarah, \"of seasons, I am flower-bearing spring.\"</p>\r\n<p>Click on the photo below to see the beautiful landscape outside my window.</p>\r\n<p>This evening Trai Prabhu and Krsnaloka organized a very nice Saturday night program at the preaching center in the city. With the help of five local devotees, Krsnaloka dd prepared an amazing feast of fried eggplant lasagna, salad, and lots of cake. So much prasadam was prepared that even though an unexpected total of 60 devotees, guests, and newcomers came for the bhajans, kirtan and lecture, almost a full tray of lasagna still remained after everyone had eaten to their full satisfaction. Everything looked so good that I was tempted to sample it. But knowing full well the consequences I would have to accept from honoring such a feast at 8:00 PM, I restrained myself and drank a small cup of lemonade instead.</p>\r\n<p>The Bologna preaching center, organized by Trai Prabhu and Krsnaloka dd, is focused on introducing the local people to Krsna consciousness through cooking classes, kirtan-yoga classes, yoga classes, and Friday harinamas. Practically every evening of every week there is an event at the center. Since the aim of the Saturday evening program is primarily to give the newcomers an introduction to Krsna consciousness through chanting, Trai Prabhu asked me to speak on the topic of chanting as a means for internal satisfaction. Unfortunately the recorder I usually use for recording was unintentially turned off. But someone else who recorded it will give me his copy later this week.</p>\r\n<p>Our next program is scheduled for Monday evening.</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\r\n<!-- START FreeVideoCoding.com -->\r\n<div><img height=\"288\" width=\"360\" alt=\"\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"this.parentNode.innerHTML = '\\x3Cembed src=\\'http://nrs.iskconboston.org/sites/default/files/EmbeddedVideos/Bologna.swf\\' width=\\'360\\' height=\\'288\\' quality=\\'high\\' type=\\'application/x-shockwave-flash\\' pluginspage=\\'http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\\'\\x3E\\x3C/embed\\x3E';\" src=\"http://nrs.iskconboston.org/sites/default/files/EmbeddedVideos/Bologna.jpg\"></div>\r\n<!-- END FreeVideoCoding.com -->",

While listening to the chirping birds and taking note of the budding trees, vines and flowers, I could not help but think of Krsna's words to Arjuna, aham rtunam kusumakarah, \"of seasons, I am flower-bearing spring.\"</p>\n<p>Click on the photo below to see the beautiful landscape outside my window.</p>\n<p>This evening Trai Prabhu and Krsnaloka organized a very nice Saturday night program at the preaching center in the city. With the help of five local devotees, Krsnaloka dd prepared an amazing feast of fried eggplant lasagna, salad, and lots of cake. So much prasadam was prepared that even though an unexpected total of 60 devotees, guests, and newcomers came for the bhajans, kirtan and lecture, almost a full tray of lasagna still remained after everyone had eaten to their full satisfaction. Everything looked so good that I was tempted to sample it. But knowing full well the consequences I would have to accept from honoring such a feast at 8:00 PM, I restrained myself and drank a small cup of lemonade instead.</p>\n<p>The Bologna preaching center, organized by Trai Prabhu and Krsnaloka dd, is focused on introducing the local people to Krsna consciousness through cooking classes, kirtan-yoga classes, yoga classes, and Friday harinamas. Practically every evening of every week there is an event at the center. Since the aim of the Saturday evening program is primarily to give the newcomers an introduction to Krsna consciousness through chanting, Trai Prabhu asked me to speak on the topic of chanting as a means for internal satisfaction. Unfortunately the recorder I usually use for recording was unintentially turned off. But someone else who recorded it will give me his copy later this week.</p>\n<p>Our next program is scheduled for Monday evening.</p>\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\n<!-- START FreeVideoCoding.com --><div><img height=\"288\" width=\"360\" alt=\"\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"this.parentNode.innerHTML = '\\x3Cembed src=\\'http://nrs.iskconboston.org/sites/default/files/EmbeddedVideos/Bologna.swf\\' width=\\'360\\' height=\\'288\\' quality=\\'high\\' type=\\'application/x-shockwave-flash\\' pluginspage=\\'http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\\'\\x3E\\x3C/embed\\x3E';\" src=\"http://nrs.iskconboston.org/sites/default/files/EmbeddedVideos/Bologna.jpg\" /></div>\n<!-- END FreeVideoCoding.com -->",

I just saw her just two days ago and my next visit will be on April 16th. 2) Late last year Sivarama Swami asked if I would be able to help develop the counselor system in Hungary until he can become more actively involved in it's development and maintenance himself.

I have also been keeping my eye on the news, not so much because I'm concerned how all of us here in Taiwan could be affected, but because I'm concerned for those who live in Japan, especially the devotees. In fact, just two nights ago, I was finally able to contact Radhika Raman dasa, a devotee I've known for more than 25 years. He lives just outside of Tokyo. I had been trying many times to phone him since the time of the quake to find out how he, his wife, and his child were, but I was not able to get through. Finally, on Sunday evening, I spoke with him and learned that although he and his family were fine, the situation in Japan was such that all of them may have to leave there very soon even though they've been living there for more than nine years.</p>\r\n<p>However, those who are concerned should know that other than sorrow for sufferings of the people of Japan, Taiwan has not been affected by the earthquake or the tsunami. There were no tremors here. There was no impact on the coastal areas here from the tsunami. There is a risk that if there are any major radiation leaks from the explosions at the nuclear plant in Japan, there could be some impact of that here in Taiwan. But, at this moment, there is no indication that anything like that has happened or will happen.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, we have been very busy preaching and I'm finding so many people receptive to the message I've been sharing with them. Since my arrival here in Taiwan five days ago, I've given three lectures to yoga students, including at least 1 – 1.5 hours of kirtan. Two of the programs were at \"True Yoga\" centers. You can find out more about \"True Yoga\" online. They are very popular yoga centers, probably one of the most popular in this part of the world.</p>\r\n<p>On Sunday I gave the Sunday lecture at the Taipei preaching center. Approximately fifty devotees and guests took part in the program. They all danced very enthusiastically during the kirtan after the lecture. On Monday evening we did a program at the home of Mukesh, a very wonderful and humble devotee from India who has lived in Taipei with his family for many years. Although they invited people from the Indian community to his home program, an additional twenty-five devotees and guests from Taiwan also participated in the program. We spoke for about an hour about the importance of the holy name, we chanted a couple of bhajans, and then ended with a very enthusiastic kirtan.</p>\r\n<p>Tonight's program at a yoga studio was especially ecstatic. Everyone chanted so enthusiastically and they were extremely appreciative of the experience they obtained from the chanting. When it came time to end the program, they were all begging for more kirtan. So we continued to chant for some time longer.</p>\r\n<p>Tomorrow night, I will be speaking and chanting at the largest yoga center in all of Taipei, and then later this week we will relocate three hours South to Taichung for two more programs including the Gaura Purnima Festival on Sunday.</p>\r\n<p>In case you're wondering why nothing has been posted in the audio or video section, it's because I have personally not recorded anything since arriving in Taiwan. One devotee, has been filming everything and has assured me that he will deliver first-class recordings of all the programs by the end of the week. Because he has to convert all of the video recordings, it's taking some extra time before he can provide me with the material. However, as soon as I have them, I will see that they get posted shortly thereafter.</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>",

The producer was very courteous and she presented her purpose for wanting to film me along with the Russian devotees. She was particularly interested in me because, as she said, I was an American preaching in Russia and that would appeal to an American audience. She also did not hide the fact they had been filming other American missionaries from different traditions in Russia who would all be included in the same segment on \"Street Stories.\" As she told me, the devotees were their last assignment in Russia.</p>\r\n<p>After some discussion, it was decided that we would spend the next several days filming devotees and myself in the temple, on harinama at the Arbat, and then they wanted to relocate to Leningrad where they hoped to film me in our restaurant and especially with the children at our small gurukula.</p>\r\n<p>According to plan, the producer, the TV correspondent, Peter Van Sant, and the camera crew took many hours of footage of the devotees in Moscow. From there we went separately to Leningrad. They flew on their private plane, I flew on Aeroflot and we met at a prearranged time and place to begin our first filming in Leningrad at the restaurant. After recording the affairs of the restaurant, including another short interview with me, we all jumped into a vehicle together to make our last and final stop on the tour to the Leningrad gurukula.</p>\r\n<p>It was there in the gurukula when I began to notice that everyone began softening up and started to become a lot more friendly, especially towards me. We had prepared lunch for the entire crew and everyone honored prasadam with great enthusiasm, eating far more than the devotees expected them to eat. Moreover, now that our time together was coming to a close, they all started asking more personal questions about the devotees and about me, seriously wanting to learn more about our values and lifestyle. In particular, they began asking a lot of questions about what made me accept Krsna consciousness as a way of life.</p>\r\n<p>Although they were scheduled to leave just after lunch, I recall that they stayed longer than they had initially planned. Filled with all kinds of Krsna prasadam, Peter Van Sant started confessing that he did not expect to find what he saw in the lives of Krsna's devotees. He was genuinely moved by their sincerity, and when he started talking about the children, he looked emotional and admitted that seeing the children brought tears to his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>Gradually everyone else on the crew also began speaking about their experiences with the devotees, and described the children to be like \"angels from heaven.\" If you look at them in some of the photos, you'll see that they were so happy being with the children. </p>\r\n<p>As it turned out they really did not want to leave. But since it was their last day in Leningrad, they had no choice. Their flight back to Moscow on their private jet was that night. And from Moscow they were scheduled to catch their onward flight to New York in the morning.</p>\r\n<p>We parted ways at the school, shaking hands and thanking each other for the experiences we shared together. However, unexpectedly, later that evening, we all met again at the airport. When they saw me coming into the departure area, they jumped up and all of them started moving quickly towards me. Again, totally unexpected, every one of them started to embrace me. It appeared that they were slightly intoxicated as apparently they were celebrating the last day of their assignment in Russia. In that state, they started to open up even more with me than before.</p>\r\n<p>All of them revealed that from all the religious groups they filmed in Russia, none of them had any substance in comparison to what they saw in the lives of the Krsna devotees. I sensed that they were telling me this almost apologetically, giving me a slight indication (although I still did not suspect at that time) that maybe the TV show was not going to be as favorable as I had hoped.</p>\r\n<p>The cameraman gave me his business card and told me that he was one of CBS network's top cameramen. He began listing the assignments he had been on all over the world. He said that from all of his assignments, his time with the devotees was one of the best experiences he ever had as a cameraman. He hugged me again and then said, \"My home is your home. Please take this card and come visit me any time you're in the New York area.\" I sensed that he really meant it.</p>\r\n<p>Then the producer spoke out next. She said, \"We have a private jet taking us to Moscow tonight! Please, please, accept our invitation and fly with us to Moscow. We would be honored to travel with you.\" I apologized and told her that as much as I would like to accompany them to Moscow, I was booked on a flight to Minsk and couldn't disappoint the devotees there who were expecting me that night.</p>\r\n<p>We exchanged many more pleasantries but soon it was time for me to board my flight to Minsk. We said our good-byes once again, but before I left, the producer asked if she could come and visit me in Boston the next time I would be in the United States. She said that she had taken some photographs of us in the school and she would like to deliver them to me personally. I thanked her for her offer and assured her that I would contact her the next time I would be in the United States. As it turned out, she did come and see me and she did bring the pictures—the same ones which I've posted here on the site.</p>\r\n<p>By the time I reached the United States I found out that the \"Street Stories\" segment on \"American missionaries in Russia\" was not as favorable as I was hoping it would be.

For the most part, the purpose of my visit to Mumbai is to be with H.H.

Since, essentially, I will be in Govardhana for only five days, I plan to use this time for myself, for reading, parikrama and as much as possible, absorbing my thoughts in Govardhana. Moreover, since the Bhaktivedanta Sadhana Asrama is a monastary, I wish to comply with the rules of the monastary which is to not encourage guests to visit me there. I also made previous plans to spend time with H.H. Partha Sarathi das Goswami during this brief visit.</p>\r\n<p>Bhaktivedanta Asrama is also publicly known as a monastary, an asrama inhabited only by men. The asrama, therefore, is under the close scrutiny of the local residents. Not wanting to bring disrepute to the asrama in the eyes of the dhama-vasis, the asrama management is careful to restrict the mixing of men and women within the asrama, as well as to control the frequency of women entering into the asrama. Devotees should be conscious of this.</p>\r\n<p>If there are devotees who will be in Vrndavana or Govardhana during the days of my stay in Govardhana, and who wish to spend time with me, then the only opportunity for this will be on February 17th, which is the day I plan to chant and visit some holy places in Govardhana. There will be no discourses—only chanting. Devotees wishing to accompany me may do so, but on the condition that there are at least an equal number of men as there are women. It can not be otherwise. </p>\r\n<p>From Govardhana my plan is to take a short darshan of Sri Sri Radha Syamasundara, Sri Sri Krsna Balarama, Sri Sri Gaura Nitai, and Srila Prabhupada on Feburary 19th. I will then relocate to Mayapura, arriving there on the morning of February 20th, the same day the GBC meetings are scheduled to begin.</p>\r\n<p>During the days of the meetings, February 20 – March 3, I will follow the same schedule I generally follow wherever I travel. I will go to mangala arati, chant japa, and will leave to do my morning therapy either just before Guru-puja or just after the Guru-Puja kirtan, depending upon the intensity of the schedule I'll have in the GBC meetings. There will be no personal meetings during this time. Neither will I take part in any events other than the morning program, GBC meetings, and associating with my godbrothers.</p>\r\n<p>After the GBC meetings I will remain in Mayapura until March 9th. This means that March 4th will be a day of complete rest, and then from March 5 – 9, I will have a restricted schedule for meeting and associating with devotees in Mayapura. I cannot yet say what that schedule will be and I probably won't be able to say what that schedule will be until the GBC meetings are finished.</p>\r\n<p>On March 9th, I will depart from Kolkata to Taiwan, where I will remain until March 21st. During my visit to Taiwan I will do programs in Taipei and Taichung, and I will try to fulfill a commitment (lecturing in Taipei) which I was unable to fulfill the last time I was in Taiwan because of the state of my health.</p>\r\n<p>On March 21st, I will fly all day, arriving in Mumbai late on the night of the same day. Provided immigration will allow my re-entry to India (because of a new law they introduced about one year ago) I will spend approximately three days in Mumbai. I am then scheduled to return to Budapest on the night of March 24th. I do have all the required documents for re-entry to India, but there's always the chance that I will meet an immigration officer who is unaware of the current details of the law. The law and it's recent revisions are quite new.</p>\r\n<p>At present, I have no schedule planned beyond March 25th, except that I will need to spend some time in Hungary upon my return from India to follow up with the work I've begun during this visit. During this visit, upon the request of H.H. Sivarama Swami, I began helping the local devotees with their development of the counselor system in Hungary.</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>",

I’m trying to think of something relevant to today’s event that I can speak about; because I can understand that today you’re welcoming Srila Prabhupada here in Yurlovo, in your temple room, taking Him on tour to see the facilities here, and placing Him on the vyasasana where He will sit and overlook the activities going on here. Of course, He will more or less be here most of the time and many of His vyasasana pastimes will be manifested during His presence here on the vyasasana.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSrila Prabhupada had so many pastimes, not just on the vyasasana and to the degree you meditate upon Him,  hear about Him, serve His instructions and read His books, to that degree Srila Prabhupada will become more and more manifested to you in your life. In other words, Srila Prabhupada is not simply a Deity sitting on the vyasasana, and the devotees who are welcoming Him here should display their realization of that by their dealings with Him, the way He is manifested here now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrabhupada, the times I saw Him sitting on the vyasasana, was always reciprocating with His disciples. In other words, although He was very conscious of Krsna’s presence on the altar, He was also very conscious of all the devotees who were present before Him. I never saw Srila Prabhupada chant His japa while He was being worshipped during the Guru-puja, for instance. He was never seen indifferent to the presence of His disciples. Srila Prabhupada would always sit there and participate ,playing the gong or the karatalas or chanting the Guru-puja kirtan. He would always look at everybody and everybody would have a sense that He was looking at them, but not only looking at them but looking much deeper than just at a physical form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had the experience once when Prabhupada was sitting and giving a Srimad-Bhagavatam class in Philadelphia. Many devotees came to see Him for that festival. I had to stay in some place far away because there was no place to stay near the temple. Therefore I, with a large group of devotees, arrived a little bit late and the temple room was already completely full when we got there. Many of us were trying to get into the temple room to see Srila Prabhupada. One devotee inside closed the door and many of us were left standing in the hall way. Prabhupada saw what was going on. He could see how crestfallen we were. The next thing we knew was that the door was opening again.  Apparently Prabhupada pointed to that devotee to open the door and gestured for all of us to come in. Even though the temple was full, Srila Prabhupada was ready to defy the physical laws of this world and He invited us all to come and sit down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTaking advantage of Srila Prabhupada’s invitation I walked toward the front to sit in front of Srila Prabhupada. I walked in, sat down and Prabhupada looked at me as I walked in, giving me his typical penetrating glance which went right through to the eyes, into the heart, and into the soul. I began to realize that Prabhupada knew me and my whole history simply by His glance. I would often stories about Prabhupada doing that to many other devotees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn other words, Srila Prabhupada was never indifferent to the presence of the devotees who were there worshipping Him. He was always very conscious of our presence and at the same time fully Krsna-conscious. Therefore, I mentioned this because this is just one example that sometimes, if we are not careful,we may think that Prabhupada is just sitting on his vyasasana and chanting His japa while we are worshipping Him in the Guru-puja, but I never saw Him do that.  Obviously Srila Prabhupada shouldn’t have His japa beads chanting His japa while we worship Him during Guru-puja.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is just one example, there are many examples that we can use to help us feel more and more Srila Prabhupada’s presence and to be conscious of His presence in this world. For instance, just this morning during Guru-puja in “Dinamo” (this is just another example, and I’m using these examples to help emphasize the point I wish to make) we greeted the Deities and then we went to receive Srila Prabhupada for his Guru-puja. I was present many times when Srila Prabhupada would greet the Deities and would then sit on His vyasasana to accept Guru-puja, and therefore I always meditate on that during Deity greet and Guru-puja. In my mind and in my heart I’m just seeing Prabhupada offering His obeisances to the Deities and returning to His vyasasana to receive His flower garland, arati, flower petals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI saw many times after the arati and after the devotees offered flower petals, Prabhupada would take the petals from His lotus feet and throw them at us. You can imagine what that did.  Srila Prabhupada would create pandemonium in the temple room. He would take the flower petals, throw them at the devotees and the devotees would take the petals, put them on their heads and then would start throwing them at each other. Then more flower petals were placed at Prabhupada’s lotus feet so that Prabhupada could take more petals and throw them.  This is another example how Prabhupada wasn’t indifferent to our presence. He wasn’t just sitting there thinking of something else.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyway, this morning Prabhupada sat on His vyasasana (generally, I immediately start leading the kirtan, because when Prabhupada sits on the vyasasana somebody should immediately start chanting), and the garland was sitting in the basket. One minute, two minutes, three minutes, four minutes passed and the garland was still sitting in the basket while I was chanting. If Prabhupada sat on the vyasasana, would the devotees wait to put on His garland? When I was with Prabhupada, every time He sat on the vjasasana, immediately there were devotees standing around who were waiting to put their garland on as soon as he sat down. One, sometimes two, three or five garlands were immediately put on Him. Sandalwood paste was put on His forehead, and then His servant would give Prabhupada either karatalas or a gong and Prabhupada would chant along.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever this morning Srila Prabhupada waited many minutes. No one put His garland on and I had to stop the kirtan to go put His garland on. Think about it. If Prabhupada sits on the vyasasana, will we make Him wait five minutes for the garland? No, immediately we will give Him his garland.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI can think of many examples. I don’t want to turn this into a chastisement for neglecting Srila Prabhupada. I just want to welcome you nto the world of being with Prabhupada. This is how you could be with Srila Prabhupada, to be very conscious that now He is coming to be with you and to just see that He is never indifferent towards us. Please never be indifferent towards Him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSrila Prabhupada’s life was reciprocating with His disciples, and everything he did, constantly we always felt Prabhupada’s reciprocation. You can feel it too. Welcome Prabhupada and be with Him every day, not only in this form here on the vyasasana but by studying His books, hearing about His activities and pastimes and serving His instructions. In this way welcome Prabhupada not only in the temple, but more deeply into your heart and Prabhupada will be there to reciprocate.<br />\r\n </p>",

The Sevaka System is an attempt to create a unified vision of care, implemented by senior devotees in Moscow from amongst the many diverse methods for outreach and care. The primary responsibility of the Sevaka Board is to develop and implement a system of care, education and training so that devotees in the Moscow community can not only take part in Srila Prabhupada's mission of hearing ,chanting, and remembering the glories of the Lord for a part of their lives, but so that they can remain actively engaged in the pursuit of Krsna consciousness in the association of devotees throughout all of their lives.</p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada empasizes the point about unity and diversity so wonderfully in the following quote from a letter written to Kirtanananda on October 18, 1973:</p>\r\n<p>\"Material nature means dissension and disagreement, especially in this Kali yuga. But, for this Krsna consciousness movement its success will depend on agreement, even though there are varieties of engagements. In the material world there are varieties, but there is no agreement. In the spiritual world there are varieties, but there is agreement. That is the difference. The materialist without being able to adjust the varieties and the disagreements makes everything zero. They cannot come into agreement with varieties, but if we keep Krsna in the center, then there will be agreement in varieties. This is called unity in diversity. I am therefore suggesting that all our men meet in Mayapur every year during the birth anniversary of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. With all GBC and senior men present we should discuss how to make unity in diversity. But, if we fight on account of diversity, then it is simply the material platform. Please try to maintain the philosophy of unity in diversity. That will make our movement successful. One section of men have already gone out, therefore we must be very careful to maintain unity in diversity, and remember the story in Aesop's Fables of the father of many children with the bundle of sticks. When the father asked his children to break the bundle of sticks wrapped in a bag, none of them could do it. But, when they removed the sticks from the bag, and tried one by one, the sticks were easily broken. So this is the strength in unity. If we are bunched up, we can never be broken, but when divided, then we can become broken very easily.\" [end of quote]</p>\r\n<p>We encourage everyone to inquire deeply from those who have been authorized to render this service and to see if you can find a place for yourself within the shelter of this bonafide method of associating with senior devotees.</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>",

Kanjalocana Prabhu told that the classes recorded on these tapes were not in the archives.</p>\n<p>Aspiring to become your servant,</p>\n<p>Prema Vardhana dasa</p>\n<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Kanjalocana dasa, Lilanath dasa and Yasoda devi dasi, who have been major contributors of videos for this site. </p>\n<p>Kanjalocana dasa maintains the \"Tape Ministry Archive\" found by clicking on the \"Videos\" link in the navigation menu on the left-side of the page. </p>\n<p>Lilanath dasa and Yasoda devi dasi have been providing videos from the ISKCON International Archives regularly ever since this site was established more than two years ago.</p>\n<p>My gratitude to all of them for their selfless service.</p>\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\n",

Of this there is no doubt. Apart from this, if even persons claiming to be devotees of Visnu are envious of ordinary living entities and give various troubles to them, they are actually far away from devotional service to Visnu and are not fit to be called human beings. Their worship of Visnu becomes the source of misery.

Srila Jiva Gosvami says, iyam ca sraddha na sastrarthavadharana-jata. Because the kanistha-adhikari’s faith is not actually based on the statements of Vedic literature, he cannot understand the exalted position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within everyone’s heart. Therefore he cannot actually manifest love of Godhead, nor can he understand the exalted position of the devotees of the Lord. Krsna is so glorious that Krsna’s intimate associates must also be glorious. But this is unknown to a kanistha-adhikari. Similarly, the essential qualification of a Vaisnava, which is to offer all respects to others (amanina manadena kirtaniyah sada harih<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">  </span>[Cc. Adi 17.31] is also conspicuous by its absence in a kanistha-adhikari. If such a person, however, has faith in the Vedic literatures and tries to understand the statements of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, he will gradually be elevated to the second—and first-class stages of devotional service.

Of this there is no doubt. Apart from this, if even persons claiming to be devotees of Visnu are envious of ordinary living entities and give various troubles to them, they are actually far away from devotional service to Visnu and are not fit to be called human beings. Their worship of Visnu becomes the source of misery. Those endowed with an absense of jive-daya, or compassion for other living entities, and yet proudly consider themselves servants of Lord Visnu achieve the threefold miseries rather than the devotional service of the Lord.<p></p></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\"><p></p></span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\"><p></p></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">Madhya Khanda, Chapter 19<p></p></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\"><p></p></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">207-Text 208<p></p></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:&lt;br /&gt;&#10;yes\"> </span>“Everyone please give your thoughts to Me.

Srila Jiva Gosvami says, iyam ca sraddha na sastrarthavadharana-jata. Because the kanistha-adhikari’s faith is not actually based on the statements of Vedic literature, he cannot understand the exalted position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within everyone’s heart. Therefore he cannot actually manifest love of Godhead, nor can he understand the exalted position of the devotees of the Lord. Krsna is so glorious that Krsna’s intimate associates must also be glorious. But this is unknown to a kanistha-adhikari. Similarly, the essential qualification of a Vaisnava, which is to offer all respects to others (amanina manadena kirtaniyah sada harih<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">  </span>[Cc. Adi 17.31] is also conspicuous by its absence in a kanistha-adhikari. If such a person, however, has faith in the Vedic literatures and tries to understand the statements of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, he will gradually be elevated to the second—and first-class stages of devotional service. (from the purport to Srimad Bhagavatam 11.2.47)<p></p></span></h3>\n<h3><p></p></h3>\n<!--EndFragment-->",

This day happened to coincide with the Disappearance Day of our Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness—His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. During the morning Srimad Bhagavatam class, Krishnananda Prabhu inspired everybody by explaining from a philosophical point of view, how to correctly understand the departure of great personalities.</p>\r\n<p>Then there was an abhisheka ceremony of Srila Prabhupada’s Murti.

This day happened to coincide with the Disappearance Day of our Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness—His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. During the morning Srimad Bhagavatam class, Krishnananda Prabhu inspired everybody by explaining from a philosophical point of view, how to correctly understand the departure of great personalities.</p>\n<p>Then there was an abhisheka ceremony of Srila Prabhupada’s Murti. Guru Maharaja took part in the abhisheka along with many other devotees. </p>\n<p>The farewell ceremony for His Holiness Srila Purnacandra Goswami Maharaja began a bit later.

We should not go too long because it gets dark early and it's best to finish this function during the daylight. We adjusted the schedule a little bit to accommodate the need to finish everything before sunset.</p>\r\n<p>We are gathered here to pay our respects to His Holiness Purnacandra Goswami. For those of you who know him, you know that he is a person of substance. I often speak about this topic --substance versus form. If there is substance then everything else will eventually follow.</p>\r\n<p>For the life of a Vaisnava this substance is his Krsna Consciousness, the activities which are performed by him in Krsna Consciousness, and the ability to share that Krsna Consciousness with others. That is the essence of our Krsna Consciousness Movement. And that substance is the heart of a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava is one who fully dedicates his life in service to the Supreme Lord. He feels compassion for the suffering of others.</p>\r\n<p>Purnacandra Maharaja was such a Vaisnava. He was not interested in the external affairs of this world. I know that because of my personal association with him. I'm sure that we'll hear more confirmation of this from others today-- that Maharaja was more interested in sharing substance and less concerned about structure or form. That is one quality of Purnacandra Maharaja I've always appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Purnacandra Maharaja would oftentimes keep his firm commitment to substance even at the risk of being unpopular. He was not at all interested in winning some popularity contest. He was interested in preserving that which was passed on to him by his spiritual master.</p>\r\n<p>Many times I would be with him and I would observe how meticulous he was in his simple, basic activities of sadhana. Sometimes I would come to see him and he would be sitting and chanting his japa alone, very much absorbed in chanting the holy name. His meditation was on his relationship with his spiritual master, and his service to his spiritual master, while aspiring for eternal devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</p>\r\n<p>Because he always preserved this substance in his life, I am confident that it will continue to maintain his life as he continues serving his spiritual master and his worshipful Lord.</p>\r\n<p>In many respects Purnacandra Maharaja was more of a teacher by his example. And though he taught this way, through this firm dedication to the simple, basic practices of Krsna Consciousness, we also know that he was very learned in sastra. He was very meticulous about his study of Srila Prabhupada's books and the books of our previous acaryas. He was always eager to share his realizations and knowledge obtained from his studies.</p>\r\n<p>Purnacandra Maharaja didn't need large crowds to be satisfied sharing what he had learned and what he attained in his Krsna Consciousness. He would share his Krsna Consciousness even with a small group of devotees, or even with one devotee. I personally experienced this when we would sit and talk as he would share his realizations with me. This is another one of his qualities I will always remember. I'm sure that many of you who know Purnacandra Maharaja will also remember this quality of his too.</p>\r\n<p>There is more that I could say about my remembrances of Maharaja but I'd like to just focus on this feature of him as a person of substance. So I'll stop here and maybe I'll have an opportunity some other time to speak about other remembrances of him.</p>\r\n<p>I am also very eager to hear from those devotees with whom this substance was shared. I'm quite sure that their words will be a testimony to my words. I consider these Vaisnavas very fortunate to have an intimate, close relationship with him. </p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>",

				"value": "<p> Dear Srila Prabhupada,</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Please accept my prostrated obeisances in the dust of your lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>I've recently found myself reflecting on verses from your \"Vrndavana Bhajana\", written by you in 1958, the year before you formerly accepted sannyasa. Needless to say, I found every verse impregnated with deep meaning, as is every word which emanates from your lotus mouth. </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>In this connection I am reminded about your answer to the following question I read just yesterday in a beautiful account of your transcendental lilas in Britain, authored by your beloved disciple, Ranchor dasa.  These few words spoken by you in 1972 in response to a journalist's query, also made a deep impression on me, an impression whose full impact is still yet to be realized.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"Do you know everything?\" one of them [the journalists] asked with a hint of sarcasm. Prabhupada took his time to answer.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"Yes. Perhaps it is true, since everything I say is from Krishna.\"</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>As soon as read this I began to more deeply contemplate our eternal connection. Although it doesn't make any difference to me whether you know everything or not, I am convinced that you know whatever Krishna wants you to know. You do whatever Krishna wants you to do. Among the many services you render to the Divine Couple, Krishna wants you to be merciful to those who have become fully dependent upon you. </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Even Krishna depends upon you, desiring your mercy! </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, He becomes dependent on His devotees.\" (SB 4.31.22)</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"With the dust of My devotees' lotus feet I desire to purify the material worlds, which are situated within Me. Thus, I always follow the footsteps of My pure devotees, who are free from all personal desire, rapt in thought of My pastimes, peaceful, without any feelings of enmity, and of equal disposition everywhere.\" (SB 11.14.16)</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>When you say you know \"everything\", you must mean that you know Krishna's heart.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am always in the heart of the pure devotee. My devotees do not know anything else but Me, and I do not know anyone else but them.  (SB 9.4.68)</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Krishna has given His heart to you because your only desire is His pleasure. </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"I am completely under the control of My devotees. Indeed, I am not at all independent. Because My devotees are completely devoid of material desires, I sit only within the cores of their hearts. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.  (SB 9.4.63)</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Please, therefore, I beg you to also take my heart and make me your fully surrendered devotee. Among all that you do know, certainly you must know that is my desire. </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>I will never be able to fully comprehend all that lies in the depths of your merciful heart.  Along with these words I offer to you today, therefore, I also offer to you the rest of my life, hoping that this will help me to more fully realize the full depths of compassion, love, and deep attachment to Krsna's service that lies within the core of your heart. It is my desire to always act according to your desire. Please, therefore, penetrate the internal region of my heart and allow me to some day more fully realize the deepest meaning of every word spoken by you. Until then, I also beg you to please accept that which I am able to offer you now.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Since a few stanzas from \"Vrndavana Bhajana\" seem to be more fixed into my memory than the whole composition, I'd like to reflect on those lines and conclude with the reason why they mean so much to me.</p>\r\n<p>\"I am sitting alone in Vrndavana-dhama<br />\r\nIn this mood I am getting many realizations.\"</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>There you were in Vrndavana, sixty-two years of your life in this world had already passed, and already four years had passed since you left all of your family connections. Every Vaisnava hankers to live and devote the remainder of his life in the Holy Dhama. Vrndavana, therefore, seemed to be the most natural place for you to pass the rest of your life, a life already replete with all realizations necessary for dedicating your mind, body and words in full service to and remembrance of Krishna. Why would you leave?</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Your answer:</p>\r\n<p>“I left the peaceful life in Vrindavan to take on so much burden and anxiety for Krishna.” (Srila Prabhupada, 1974).</p>\r\n<p>Full service to and remembrance of Krishna, for you, meant giving Krishna to the world and to all of us. <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span></p>\r\n<p>\"Always preach! From jiva's door to door<br />\r\nYour life will be successful as a result of your preaching.\"</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>You left Vrndavana to preach all over the whole world, because that was the order you received from your spiritual master, an order apparently still unfulfilled at the time this was written.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span></p>\r\n<p>\"Sri Dayita dasa prabhu gave this instruction<br />\r\n\"'Chant Hare Krsna loudly, this is my initiation:'\"</p>\r\n<p>You made it clear that your connection (initiation) with your own spiritual master was only through serving his order—Chant Hare Krsna loudly and \"loudly\" for you, meant that Krsna's name must be heard \"all over the world.\"</p>\r\n<p>I am reminded of an event which took place in 1959, the same day you accepted sannyasa. Your beloved godbrother and friend, Krsnadas Babaji Maharaja, many years later related this story to a group of your disciples. He told them that during the yajna, his chanting distracted others also taking part in the yajna. But Babaji Maharaja would always be chanting, no matter where he was. One Vaisnava requested Babaji Maharaja to chant softer so that the mantras being chanted for the yajna could be heard. You then turned to your dear godbrother and appealed to him, \"Chant louder! Chant louder!\" Babaji Maharaja told your disciples that it was right at that moment that he realized that you had such complete faith in the loud chanting of the holy name that you would surely be the one empowered to spread the glories of the holy name all over the world.</p>\r\n<p>\"Come out of your cage, stop making objection<br />\r\nEverything belongs to Sri Hari and Sri Hari belongs to everyone.\"</p>\r\n<p>While others in Vrndavana were thinking that Krishna was only for them, seeing every living being as an eternal servant of Krishna, and being empowered by the full mercy of Mahaprabhu, you were convinced that Krishna and His devotional service was for everyone.  Or, as Krsnadas Kaviraj Goswami proclaimed in Caitanya Caritamrita, \"Not considering who asked for it and who did not, nor who was fit and who unfit to receive it, Caitanya Mahaprabhu distributed the fruit of devotional service.\" You embodied exactly this same mood.   </p>\r\n<p>\"Chant the Hare Krsna mantra loudly<br />\r\nBy the performance of such sankirtana there will come remembrance automatically<br />\r\nThen there will be nirjana bhajana manifested in the heart spontaneously.\"</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>It is this conclusion, Srila Prabhupada, which inspires me with great hope.

All glories to Your Divine Grace.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>I've recently found myself reflecting on verses from your \"Vrndavana Bhajana\", written by you in 1958, the year before you formerly accepted sannyasa. Needless to say, I found every verse impregnated with deep meaning, as is every word which emanates from your lotus mouth. </p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>In this connection I am reminded about your answer to the following question I read just yesterday in a beautiful account of your transcendental lilas in Britain, authored by your beloved disciple, Ranchor dasa.  These few words spoken by you in 1972 in response to a journalist's query, also made a deep impression on me, an impression whose full impact is still yet to be realized.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"Do you know everything?\" one of them [the journalists] asked with a hint of sarcasm. Prabhupada took his time to answer.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"Yes. Perhaps it is true, since everything I say is from Krishna.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>As soon as read this I began to more deeply contemplate our eternal connection. Although it doesn't make any difference to me whether you know everything or not, I am convinced that you know whatever Krishna wants you to know. You do whatever Krishna wants you to do. Among the many services you render to the Divine Couple, Krishna wants you to be merciful to those who have become fully dependent upon you. </p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Even Krishna depends upon you, desiring your mercy! </p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, He becomes dependent on His devotees.\" (SB 4.31.22)</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"With the dust of My devotees' lotus feet I desire to purify the material worlds, which are situated within Me. Thus, I always follow the footsteps of My pure devotees, who are free from all personal desire, rapt in thought of My pastimes, peaceful, without any feelings of enmity, and of equal disposition everywhere.\" (SB 11.14.16)</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>When you say you know \"everything\", you must mean that you know Krishna's heart.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am always in the heart of the pure devotee. My devotees do not know anything else but Me, and I do not know anyone else but them.  (SB 9.4.68)</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Krishna has given His heart to you because your only desire is His pleasure. </p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>\"I am completely under the control of My devotees. Indeed, I am not at all independent. Because My devotees are completely devoid of material desires, I sit only within the cores of their hearts. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.  (SB 9.4.63)</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Please, therefore, I beg you to also take my heart and make me your fully surrendered devotee. Among all that you do know, certainly you must know that is my desire. </p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>I will never be able to fully comprehend all that lies in the depths of your merciful heart.  Along with these words I offer to you today, therefore, I also offer to you the rest of my life, hoping that this will help me to more fully realize the full depths of compassion, love, and deep attachment to Krsna's service that lies within the core of your heart. It is my desire to always act according to your desire. Please, therefore, penetrate the internal region of my heart and allow me to some day more fully realize the deepest meaning of every word spoken by you. Until then, I also beg you to please accept that which I am able to offer you now.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Since a few stanzas from \"Vrndavana Bhajana\" seem to be more fixed into my memory than the whole composition, I'd like to reflect on those lines and conclude with the reason why they mean so much to me.</p>\n<p>\"I am sitting alone in Vrndavana-dhama<br />\nIn this mood I am getting many realizations.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>There you were in Vrndavana, sixty-two years of your life in this world had already passed, and already four years had passed since you left all of your family connections. Every Vaisnava hankers to live and devote the remainder of his life in the Holy Dhama. Vrndavana, therefore, seemed to be the most natural place for you to pass the rest of your life, a life already replete with all realizations necessary for dedicating your mind, body and words in full service to and remembrance of Krishna. Why would you leave?</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Your answer:</p>\n<p>“I left the peaceful life in Vrindavan to take on so much burden and anxiety for Krishna.” (Srila Prabhupada, 1974).</p>\n<p>Full service to and remembrance of Krishna, for you, meant giving Krishna to the world and to all of us. <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span></p>\n<p>\"Always preach! From jiva's door to door<br />\nYour life will be successful as a result of your preaching.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>You left Vrndavana to preach all over the whole world, because that was the order you received from your spiritual master, an order apparently still unfulfilled at the time this was written.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span></p>\n<p>\"Sri Dayita dasa prabhu gave this instruction<br />\n\"'Chant Hare Krsna loudly, this is my initiation:'\"</p>\n<p>You made it clear that your connection (initiation) with your own spiritual master was only through serving his order—Chant Hare Krsna loudly and \"loudly\" for you, meant that Krsna's name must be heard \"all over the world.\"</p>\n<p>I am reminded of an event which took place in 1959, the same day you accepted sannyasa. Your beloved godbrother and friend, Krsnadas Babaji Maharaja, many years later related this story to a group of your disciples. He told them that during the yajna, his chanting distracted others also taking part in the yajna. But Babaji Maharaja would always be chanting, no matter where he was. One Vaisnava requested Babaji Maharaja to chant softer so that the mantras being chanted for the yajna could be heard. You then turned to your dear godbrother and appealed to him, \"Chant louder! Chant louder!\" Babaji Maharaja told your disciples that it was right at that moment that he realized that you had such complete faith in the loud chanting of the holy name that you would surely be the one empowered to spread the glories of the holy name all over the world.</p>\n<p>\"Come out of your cage, stop making objection<br />\nEverything belongs to Sri Hari and Sri Hari belongs to everyone.\"</p>\n<p>While others in Vrndavana were thinking that Krishna was only for them, seeing every living being as an eternal servant of Krishna, and being empowered by the full mercy of Mahaprabhu, you were convinced that Krishna and His devotional service was for everyone.

So from time to time I just ask somebody if they would be willing to take pictures or shoot videos for posting on this site.</p>\r\n<p>About a week and a half ago, I made a similar request to Nama Ruci dasa in New Vraja Dhama. Nama Ruci likes to take photos, and in fact, many of the earlier photos found on this site from either Budapest Rathayatra or from different events in New Vraja Dhama were taken by him with his camera. However, knowing that Nama Ruci likes fresh challenges, this time I asked him if he would take some video shots of New Vraja Dhama. At first, Nama Ruci was a little bewildered by my request. He didn't quite know what I was looking for. But then again, neither did I. I told him, \"Just take the camera and shoot whatever you see in New Vraja Dhama. It's all transcendental anyway.\" So that's what he did.</p>\r\n<p>It just so happened the next day, August 10th, the day when Nama Ruci did all of his shooting, there were sixty devotees visiting New Vraja Dhama from the Dubai yatra. They were on a tour of several temples in Europe and New Vraja Dhama was one of the main pilgimage sites they wanted to see. So the bus filled with these devotees arrived in New Vraja Dhama late on the night of August 9th.</p>\r\n<p>Several hours before they arrived, Sivarama Maharaja came to my room and asked me if I would give Srimad Bhagavatam class to them the following morning, a request from him which I could not refuse. So when I showed up for Deity Greeting, Guru Puja and class, it didn't take too long before I learned that their bus arrived in New Vraja Dhama \"very\" late the previous night. It all became clear to me as soon as I started to speak.  As I was apologetically told after class, even though they all arrived at about one in the morning, they were all at mangala arati, japa, Guru Puja and class. So you may be able to imagine what it was like speaking to sixty devotees who all slept no more than two hours the previous night. Fortunately, Nama Ruci didn't focus on that with the camera, and neither did I with my class.</p>\r\n<p>After class Nama Ruci dasa went about fulfilling the mission I had given to him and the following day the camera was delivered back to me by Nilamani Cakravarti devi dasi, his wife. Nama Ruci dasa had to leave New Vraja Dhama for several days and by the time he got back, I was preparing to leave New Vraja Dhama so that I could get to the Kazakh Embassy on the last day it would be opened before my departure to Almaty. It was then, when the camera was handed back to me, that I realized that the suggestion I had also made on the day I gave Nama Ruci the camera, to work together to edit the videos, was not going to take place. </p>\r\n<p>I originally proposed to Nama Ruci that we edit the video \"together,\" because I didn't know if he knew anything about video editing. Certainly I didn't. Having never done it before I thought that between the two of us we might have a better chance of producing something worthwhile. I should have also considered the fact that Nama Ruci dasa doesn't speak English and neither do I speak Hungarian. </p>\r\n<p>After looking at some of the clips it appeared that Nama Ruci must have spent quite a few hours shooting the videos I asked him to shoot. Not wanting his efforts to go in vain, yesterday I decided to load all the clips into iMovie and this morning I put them together. I'm no film editor and that will become clear by what you'll see in the 30-minute clip of \"A Slight Glimpse of New Vraja Dhama.\"</p>\r\n<p>Like Lilasuka dasa (mentioned in my August 17th blog) just as his time is much better spent by focusing on the preaching in Budapest rather than developing his videography skills, my time will be much better spent chanting, writing, reading, (I also now have to exercise every 30-60 minutes a day) and communicating with devotees all over the world rather than on editing video clips in iMovie.</p>\r\n<p>The bottom line is that I could have spent more time on editing, but I didn't. I did manage though, to add a really nice soundtrack, a few beautiful photos of the Deities which were posted here on the site two years ago, and I tried my best to meditate on Radhe Syama in the process. </p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>",

So when I showed up for Deity Greeting, Guru Puja and class, it didn't take too long before I learned that their bus arrived in New Vraja Dhama \"very\" late the previous night. It all became clear to me as soon as I started to speak.  As I was apologetically told after class, even though they all arrived at about one in the morning, they were all at mangala arati, japa, Guru Puja and class. So you may be able to imagine what it was like speaking to sixty devotees who all slept no more than two hours the previous night. Fortunately, Nama Ruci didn't focus on that with the camera, and neither did I with my class.</p>\n<p>After class Nama Ruci dasa went about fulfilling the mission I had given to him and the following day the camera was delivered back to me by Nilamani Cakravarti devi dasi, his wife. Nama Ruci dasa had to leave New Vraja Dhama for several days and by the time he got back, I was preparing to leave New Vraja Dhama so that I could get to the Kazakh Embassy on the last day it would be opened before my departure to Almaty. It was then, when the camera was handed back to me, that I realized that the suggestion I had also made on the day I gave Nama Ruci the camera, to work together to edit the videos, was not going to take place. </p>\n<p>I originally proposed to Nama Ruci that we edit the video \"together,\" because I didn't know if he knew anything about video editing. Certainly I didn't. Having never done it before I thought that between the two of us we might have a better chance of producing something worthwhile. I should have also considered the fact that Nama Ruci dasa doesn't speak English and neither do I speak Hungarian. </p>\n<p>After looking at some of the clips it appeared that Nama Ruci must have spent quite a few hours shooting the videos I asked him to shoot. Not wanting his efforts to go in vain, yesterday I decided to load all the clips into iMovie and this morning I put them together. I'm no film editor and that will become clear by what you'll see in the 30-minute clip of \"A Slight Glimpse of New Vraja Dhama.\"</p>\n<p>Like Lilasuka dasa (mentioned in my August 17th blog) just as his time is much better spent by focusing on the preaching in Budapest rather than developing his videography skills, my time will be much better spent chanting, writing, reading, (I also now have to exercise every 30-60 minutes a day) and communicating with devotees all over the world rather than on editing video clips in iMovie.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that I could have spent more time on editing, but I didn't. I did manage though, to add a really nice soundtrack, a few beautiful photos of the Deities which were posted here on the site two years ago, and I tried my best to meditate on Radhe Syama in the process. </p>\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\n",

The rooms were immaculately clean, as is everything in New Vraja Dhama, and all the walls were freshly painted. I was greatly appreciating the simplicity of New Vraja Dhama householder life, and I was also imagining how difficult it would be for many householders to live in such a simple environment.</p>\r\n<p>I attributed the success of their lifestyle to the fact that most New Vraja Dhama devotees spend most of their waking hours actively serving within the community. All of New Vraja Dhama is their home, service to Radha Syamasundara is their life, and their humble dwelling is simply where they rest for the night, where they may take a short rest or read during the day, or possibly where they would recuperate if they should fall sick.

I did not come with the intention to speak, and therefore I simply asked Lilasuka dasa, the Budapest Temple President, if he would translate Sivarama Maharaja's talk for me. After his talk, Sivarama Maharaja then asked Kesava Bharati Maharaja, who was sitting immediately next to him if he would say something. He spoke briefly, (his talk is posted on www.sivaramaswami.com) and then, caught by surprise, Maharaja turned to me and asked if I wanted to say something.

From what I've seen of the video so far, it appears that a lot of the shooting was more of the sky than what was below. Of course, it's possible he saw something in the sky that I wasn't able to see.

So getting his association once again was also very refreshing.</p>\r\n<p>I now must return to my daily exercise regimen. Although I was strict in Lithuania, unfortunately I was not strict enough. There were some setbacks. But it appears to me that they are not too serious. Hopefully the therapist will agree with me. I have an appointment with her tomorrow morning, at which time I should have a more clear picture of where everything stands. Assuming that she will not reintroduce severe restrictions on me again, I am already prepared to publish the dates and places for my next trip from Hungary.</p>\r\n<p>The next two weeks I will stay in New Vraja Dhama. Actually, because I had to stay in Budapest for five months in order to take treatment in the clinic, I have not stayed for more than a week in New Vraja Dhama since last December. So I am very much looking forward to being once again in Radha Syamasundara's Holy Dhama and to obtain the opportunity to chant Their glories in the association of Their surrendered servants, especially His Holiness Sivarama Maharaja.</p>\r\n<p>Tomorrow I am also applying for my visa to Kazakhstan so that I can fulfill my commitment to His Holiness B.B. Govinda Maharaja that I would take part in their festival from August 28th – September 4th. I presently have a booking to depart from Budapest on August 26th to Almaty, but I am also wait-listed on the 22nd, 23rd, and 25th. If a seat should clear for me on one of those earlier dates, I will leave for Almaty earlier so that I can settle down there and rest before the festival begins. As I have been told, attending that festival will be H.H. B.B. Govinda Maharaja, H.H. Indradyumna Maharaja, H.H. Bhakti Vidya Purna Maharaja, and H.H. Giriraja Maharaja. So I am definitely looking forward to some nice kirtans and hari katha for that week in Almaty.</p>\r\n<p>From Almaty, I am planning to fly to Kiev on September 7th, at which time I will greet some of my invited guests who will be taking part in this year's Evpatoriya Festival. From Kiev I am booked to fly to Evpatoriya on the evening of September 9th, so that I can also settle in there and rest in time for the first day of the festival on September 11th.</p>\r\n<p>As per tradition, I will not hold any personal meetings during the Evpatoriya Festival, especially since I will be hosting many new visitors to this year's festival. However, my return flight to Kiev is booked for the evening of September 16th. If necessary, it may be possible to schedule a few meetings during the early afternoon of September 16th. Madana-mohana dasa will be my secretary in Evpatoriya. Devotees can contact him there, and only then will I be able to confirm whether or not a few meetings will be possible on the 16th. I will not confirm any meetings until a day or two before the 16th.</p>\r\n<p>On September 17th, I am scheduled to fly to Budapest and from the airport I will go directly to New Vraja Dhama to celebrate Radhastami with the devotees of New Vraja Dhama on September 19th. At present, my plan is to remain in New Vraja Dhama for approximately one week in order to fulfill some commitments I made with several of my godbrothers, including Purusartha dasa, a godbrother who joined in Boston not long after I did and with whom I associated very closely for many years subsequent to that. Both he and his wife, Tulasi dasi, who I have also known for 30 years, will be attending the Evpatoriya Festival and we will be traveling together to Hungary on September 17th.</p>\r\n<p>I have more travel plans after that visit to New Vraja Dhama, but since my plans seem a bit ambitious for somebody who is still not supposed to be traveling much, I will stop here for now and as time passes I will hopefully be able to better ascertain whether or not I will be able to follow through with those plans.</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>",

So I am very much looking forward to being once again in Radha Syamasundara's Holy Dhama and to obtain the opportunity to chant Their glories in the association of Their surrendered servants, especially His Holiness Sivarama Maharaja.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow I am also applying for my visa to Kazakhstan so that I can fulfill my commitment to His Holiness B.B. Govinda Maharaja that I would take part in their festival from August 28th – September 4th. I presently have a booking to depart from Budapest on August 26th to Almaty, but I am also wait-listed on the 22nd, 23rd, and 25th. If a seat should clear for me on one of those earlier dates, I will leave for Almaty earlier so that I can settle down there and rest before the festival begins. As I have been told, attending that festival will be H.H. B.B. Govinda Maharaja, H.H. Indradyumna Maharaja, H.H. Bhakti Vidya Purna Maharaja, and H.H. Giriraja Maharaja. So I am definitely looking forward to some nice kirtans and hari katha for that week in Almaty.</p>\n<p>From Almaty, I am planning to fly to Kiev on September 7th, at which time I will greet some of my invited guests who will be taking part in this year's Evpatoriya Festival. From Kiev I am booked to fly to Evpatoriya on the evening of September 9th, so that I can also settle in there and rest in time for the first day of the festival on September 11th.</p>\n<p>As per tradition, I will not hold any personal meetings during the Evpatoriya Festival, especially since I will be hosting many new visitors to this year's festival. However, my return flight to Kiev is booked for the evening of September 16th. If necessary, it may be possible to schedule a few meetings during the early afternoon of September 16th. Madana-mohana dasa will be my secretary in Evpatoriya. Devotees can contact him there, and only then will I be able to confirm whether or not a few meetings will be possible on the 16th. I will not confirm any meetings until a day or two before the 16th.</p>\n<p>On September 17th, I am scheduled to fly to Budapest and from the airport I will go directly to New Vraja Dhama to celebrate Radhastami with the devotees of New Vraja Dhama on September 19th. At present, my plan is to remain in New Vraja Dhama for approximately one week in order to fulfill some commitments I made with several of my godbrothers, including Purusartha dasa, a godbrother who joined in Boston not long after I did and with whom I associated very closely for many years subsequent to that. Both he and his wife, Tulasi dasi, who I have also known for 30 years, will be attending the Evpatoriya Festival and we will be traveling together to Hungary on September 17th.</p>\n<p>I have more travel plans after that visit to New Vraja Dhama, but since my plans seem a bit ambitious for somebody who is still not supposed to be traveling much, I will stop here for now and as time passes I will hopefully be able to better ascertain whether or not I will be able to follow through with those plans.</p>\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>The following is a transcription of a talk given during the Gaura Purnima Festival by Aindra Prabhu in Mayapura, 2010.</p>\r\n<p>Please remember and I beseech you again and again. Please remember: world-wide, ISKCON, grass-roots, nama-sankirtan revolution. Revolution means revolution. It means we have to shed pounds and gallons and gallons of blood to get the job done. We have to turn this movement inside out, upside down, whatever we have to do, but we have to put nama-sankirtan back into it's rightful place of dignity in the forefront of our movement. It's absolutely essential for the proper growth of our movement. Those who understood this are awake to the need of the hour. And those who have not understood it are still sleeping. It's time to wake up and understand what is the responsibility of every man, woman and child in this movement; to take seriously that dharma which Lord Caitanya Himself inaugurated for the deliverance of all the fallen conditioned souls for the rest of this Kali Yuga.</p>\r\n<p>There's another 427,000 years left to Kali Yuga. The yuga dharma doesn't change. The next yuga is Satya Yuga and for them contemplative, peaceful meditation is where it's at. But in Kali Yuga you got to get fired up; every one of you, fired up— chanting, dancing from the heart like you really mean it—like you really want Lord Caitanya's mercy. So that you can even think, you can even hope, to go back home, back to Godhead in this one lifetime. It's not a joke. It's the real thing. So stand up and do what's right. Do the real thing. Perform nama-sankirtan daily, every day, for as many hours as possible and you'll get there. I guarantee it. Not that I guarantee it. Lord Caitanya has guaranteed it. And help others to understand the need to augment the performance of nama-sankirtan; to increase the performance of nama-sankirtan on a regular, daily basis in every major city all over the world.</p>\r\n<p>That's what has to happen to make this ISKCON movement grow properly. Otherwise what happens is that you get a deformed child due to undernourishment. You understand this? Can you understand it? The way to feed the child in Kali Yuga— you have to water the creeper of devotion. And you have to give the creeeper of devotion proper nourishment. It doesn't just mean a few snik, snik, rama ramas as a token gesture on the side. That's not going to get you back home, back to Godhead. You may take another 700 lifetimes to get home, back to Godhead, that way. It means getting fired up and doing the real thing—the yuga dharma, harinama sankirtan. There's no other yuga dharma for anyone of us. And there's no way that you are going to get Krsna prema in this Kali Yuga if you don't do the Kali Yuga dharma. That's the way to do it.</p>\r\n<p>Trnad api sunicena, that's what it means to be humble. Humble enough to recognize that you're one of the fallen creatures that has to take advantage of the opportunity to perform nama-sankirtan while you have the opportunity. Who knows what kind of condtion the demons are going to impose on us in some future date? Global tyranny is on it's way. Don't think otherwise. You don't know what's going to happen in the future. But right now we can take the opportunity. Right now we have the facility to congregate and dance and chant. Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>\r\n<p>And especially in Vrndavana where you get a thousand times the benefit of chanting Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>\r\n<p>Taror iva sahisnuna means to stand up and do what's right against all odds. If your temple authorities tell you not to perform the yuga dharma, not to perform sankirtan, then I'm sorry, they are not your authorities. If your guru tells you not to perform nama-sankirtan, then I'm sorry, he is not your guru, because he's not representing adi-guru, Nityananda, who created the Nama-Hatta, the marketplace of the holy name, by loudly propagating nama-sankirtan. And if the guru is not satisfied by our performance of nama-sankirtan, then he's not our guru.</p>\r\n<p>Caitya-guru is satisfied and the proper representative will manifest in due course to encourage you to do the right thing against all odds, taror iva sahisnuna amaninena. What does amaninena mean? It simply means not to expect to be regarded, not to expect to be regarded as having the fitness for any other dharma in this age. The soul has to go back back to Godhead, and the way that's going to happen is if the soul agrees to engage all of his psychophysical energies and his whole heart in the performance of sneha samyukta harinama sankirtan. Sneha means with affection. Samyukta means complete engagement. Full on! Fired up! And back home, back to Godhead in this one lifetime. Don't let anyone tell you that it can't be done.</p>\r\n<p>Why did Srila Prabhupada stress book distribution? Book distribution is for the purpose of philosophically convincing others to join Lord Caitanya's harinama sankirtan party. If they come and they see that there's no practical demonstration of the life of all transcendental knowledge in the books, for them to participate in, be a part of, then no wonder devotees are leaving and going hither and thither to look for the higher taste. Because they are not getting the higher taste. They are not getting harinama ruci. They are not geting suddha-nama ruci, because they are not doing that activity which actually helps us to get suddha-nama ruci. The most powerful process for getting suddha-nama ruci is the loud congregational chanting of the holy name Much more so that nama-japa. Nama-japa is like taking tablets. And nama-sankirtan is like an injection when you really need it bad. Because you're sick. And if you think you're not sick, you're in illusion. So you need to take the medicine. And medicine means proper dosage and proper frequency. Not just a little token lip service, a little makeshow,  to kind of like... and then anthropologically study about it in the scriptures. That, \"Oh that was back in Lord Caitanya's time.\"</p>\r\n<p>So, anyway, on that note, I humbly request all of you; it's very important that we understand this philosophy. We have to understand the philosophy. If you're chanting and dancing in Lord Caitanya's sankirtan movement, then basically you've understood the philosophy. And if you're not chanting and dancing in Lord Caitanya's sankirtan, then it means that you simply have not understood the philosophy. Hari Bol.</p>",

Yesterday we fought through traffic all morning to come here only to be told that they were not accepting visa applications yesterday.

In consultation with many devotees I am hearing again and again that the risks of losing progress are just too great. Therefore at this point in time I am still not making any plans to travel. The only plans I am making at this time are to visit Kazakhstan at the end of August and to attend the Evpatoriya Festival after that. My thoughts are that those two events are far enough away to make plans for.

I just finished with the clinic about a week and a half ago. Now I am moving in the next phase of physical therapy. The therapist estimates approximately two more months for that. My estimate may differ, but for now, I'm keeping silent and will continue to cooperate.</p>\n<p>I apologize for my inability to maintain regular blogs for the last couple of weeks. I've been dealing with many other immediate issues, while still trying to put time in for working on \"Lectures from a Disciple\", Volume Three. Although there is tangible improvement with my back, I still need to follow the same daily routine, going through cycles of sitting, standing, walking and lying down, which has its impact on how much time I can spend writing. My hope is that as my back continues to improve, so will my ability to maintain regular blogs along with everything else I need to take care of while being physically absent from the temples I usually visit each year. Still, I hope to be able to post at least once again this weekend.</p>\n<p>Hare Krsna.</p>\n\n",

Below is my offering to my wife. Somehow two weeks have already gone by. If you like please pass it on so that it can be put on your website. I hope to see you in September, as the song goes. We will see what happens. If there is anything I can do for you let me know. I will probably spend part of June with my daughter who is about to have her first child the end of this month.

I am doing okay, all things considered, and eager to see what Krishna has in store for me next. </p>\r\n<p>your servant, Srutakirti das</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><img width=\"200\" height=\"276\" vspace=\"1\" hspace=\"1\" border=\"1\" align=\"left\" alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/webfm/Fileshare/Miscellaneous/Melbourne_2007.jpg\">A tribute to Amekhala devi dasi   by Srutakirti das</p>\r\n<p>It has been two weeks since my wife left this world under the protection of Srila Prabhuapda. I have wanted to write my offering, my homage to her, but I haven’t been able to do it. I haven’t been able to think very clearly. My entire life was turned upside down in a moment. I was so busy taking care of her for the last 18 months I never had time to contemplate on what was happening right in front of my eyes.</p>\r\n<p>Feelings of emptiness embrace me at every moment. Besides her leaving I’ve had to deal with more than a few devotees telling me she has visited them since her departure. Many would be skeptical, some may not. I have always been a skeptic myself. I have never felt mystical experiences, \"beings\" around me or anything like that. I don’t doubt it could happen, that someone might see her silhouette, hear her speak, or feel her presence. I know that anything is possible. Once, Srila Prabhupada was asked if there were any ghosts around. He answered, “wall to wall.” I even believe she did visit these fortunate devotees but that makes me more upset. What about me, your husband, who has taken care of you and nursed you 24 hours a day. I know I’m dull headed but damn. I have been talking to her and pleading for a dream, a voice or a breeze next to me. Anything! I have been so lonely. </p>\r\n<p>On Tuesday, May 4th I left our home in the UK. I spent the next 3 days at my sister’s home visiting my eighty-seven year old mother. I wanted her to know I was okay and going to survive this trauma. She lost her husband at 30 and had to raise three of us on her own. She remained unmarried and never wavered in her duties since then. She drives to church every morning, still.</p>\r\n<p>This morning at 4:30 a.m. I left my family and drove to JFK airport in New York. When I put my bags in the car I felt like it was a new life in front of me, but had no idea what it was. I was on my own now. I thought at least the time of the day was auspicious. I thought I am being forced to have complete faith in Guru and Krishna. It was a 100 mile drive from my mother’s house. I was taking my next flight to a quiet place to chant and hopefully write. I was going to be staying with devotee friends there for the next few weeks. While driving, every now and then I talked to Amekhala, out loud. This is not my style, but everything has changed. I prayed to her, to please give me some sign she was still with me. I really believed it was possible she could comfort me. I have just been thinking that I don’t deserve it because of my many sinful activities and offenses to devotees in this life.</p>\r\n<p>The flight was at 8:45 a.m. Amekhala and I always left early for the airport, rather than rushing and being in anxiety about not being on time. I dropped off the Hertz one-way rental and asked a few people to help me find my way onto the train that whizzes around to the eight different terminals. I don’t know my way around JFK at all. I know Heathrow Airport in England very well. I checked my bags at Jetblue Airways. With plenty of time I went through security and then stepped onto the moving aisles headed to the main departure area. With my rolling hand luggage I stepped off the moving ramp and walked a few steps. I looked up. There was a large triangular shaped center area with three levels, some cushions and outlets where you can plug in your computer. It was the hub to all 30 gates. I thought that was great. I'll plug in my computer and try to find a wireless signal. I took a few more steps and looked straight into her youngest son’s bright blue eyes. It was Vrinny! We couldn’t believe it. Impossible! It was a real live miracle for both of us. Since the day before I left the UK we hadn’t spoken a word. He was not in the house the morning I left the UK. Neither of us had any idea where or when the other was going. The day before he missed his connecting flight to Florida because it arrived late from Heathrow so he had to stay in New York an extra day and leave this morning. How cheeky of Amekhala to arrange it for us. It was my miracle, at last! We hugged and laughed both knowing this was no accident. Out of all airports we both could have been in and in one of the biggest airports in the world I walked right up to him. Ten minutes later it would not have happened. If I were him I would have already been at the gate because his flight was leaving in 45 minutes. He said he always waits to the last minute to get on the plane. I’m the exact opposite. I got there early and wanted to be on my flight first, but because I had plenty of time I didn’t walk to the gate.</p>\r\n<p>We both knew it was special. Not a blade of grass moves without the sanction of the Supreme Lord. We talked for almost an hour. We both knew Amekhala was with us laughing and smiling. I told Vrinny how much his mom had protected me over the last seven years and how since she left she has become my \"guardian angel.\" I know she will always help me. From the beginning of our relationship she has been what I wanted and needed. Vrinny also now understood she will always be there for him as well. We were both so happy and both needed this so much. I still can’t get over walking right into him. That \"little\" sign gave me so much.</p>\r\n<p>Separation is not the same as lamentation. That one moment will carry me for a long time. I know there will be others. Every moment I make a choice to see Krishna or not see Him. He is always there. Amekhala will also be there with her look of approval, or disapproval. At this moment I am happy. Right now on my flight the seat next to me is empty but I don’t see it that way. I have to learn how to relish separation. That’s the purpose of this human life--to develop love for our Guru and Krishna, and in our separation, to want nothing else except to render devotional service and go back home, back to Godhead. There we will be together with all of Srila Prabhupada’s followers.</p>\r\n<p>While I was taking care of Amekhala many devotees would tell me what a wonderful service I was doing and ask me if I was okay. I could only think of her condition. She was disintegrating before my eyes. She never complained about it and simply accepted it as her karma. She never wanted anyone to feel sorry for her. She said that she felt sorry for everyone else because she was almost finished with her suffering, but others would still have to go through it. That made her sad. Her strength and conviction always amazed me. This never changed throughout her painful ordeal. It was one of her most attractive qualities. She always remained positive in her life despite many very difficult circumstances. She used that experience to try and help others with their own hardships in the most caring way.</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2010 she developed septicemia (an infection in the blood). Because of the chemotherapy session her immune system was extremely poor. Her temperature went up to 107 degrees F (42 degrees C). She was in a very blissful state at the time, in and out of consciousness. She kept telling me that the trick was to realize that we are not the doers. She kept emphasizing that Krishna was in control. Once she said, “But I am stubborn.” She said she understood that Krishna loves us because if He didn’t He wouldn’t put so much effort into trying to help us.</p>\r\n<p>At that time she saw Srila Prabhuapda with a dozen beautiful gardenia garlands around his neck, looking very regal. She said she always thought he was disgusted with her, but now she knew he loved her. She was worthy of being loved. Twice she saw Mayaypur dhama. Each time she saw a very young boy she thought was Lord Caitanya. Each time He ran away laughing saying it wasn’t her time yet. Then she saw a little blue boy who also laughed and ran away. She said, “I have relevance! I deserve, only because Krishna loves me.”  Then she said, “I am nothing and I don’t want anyone to think I am anything.” Then in her typically positive fashion said, “The cancer is not going to kill us. We are going to kill the cancer. Krishna has more power.”</p>\r\n<p>She ended by saying with pride that even with a temperature of 107 degrees she still recognized everyone around her. At the time, over fifty devotees had rushed over to the house to see her because we thought she was in her final hours. Even in such a physical state, she gave all of her love and a blissful smile to every one of them. She stayed with us for nine more weeks, barely eating or drinking during that time. </p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada exhibited unalloyed love for Krishna. Amekhala exhibited to me her unalloyed love for Srila Prabhupada. She showed me the same undeviating love in our relationship. She wouldn’t settle for anything less for herself. She taught me so much in a short time. As the months passed by I realized she wasn’t my wife. She belonged to Krishna and was Srila Prabhupada’s daughter. I was being offered the opportunity to serve her. As the cancer progressed throughout her body she became weaker and the pain increased dramatically. I had to take care of all her needs. My only focus was to try and relieve her suffering. I was engaged in devotional service. I had no choice. I loved her.</p>\r\n<p>I have been given more mercy than I deserve in this life. I want to learn to be grateful. I don’t want to spend my days filled with lamentation over \"my\" loss. I want to appreciate all I have been given. I had over seven wonderful years with Amekhala and have had forty years of association with devotees. I know I will be on a roller coaster of emotions for quite a while. However, I am happy knowing Amekhala devi dasi passed her final test and has given me tools to help me pass mine.</p>\r\n<p>All glories to Srila Prabhupada! All glories to Amekhala who freely gave her loving care to so many devotees for forty years. Her example will be appreciated by so many for the rest of their lives. I am one of them. </p>\r\n<p>Your servant,</p>\r\n<p>Srutakirti das</p>",

And I am working with the Gauranga Press editors, English division, making a major revision of \"Lectures from a Disciple,\" Volume 1. A lot of material which needs to be proofread by me for that revision came to me during this past week. I will still need to give that even more immediate attention during the upcoming week.</p>\r\n<p>I also did some work on reviving the Russian division of Gauranga Press, preparing ground for reprinting all books published in Russian so that they can be available in the CIS countries as well as through mailorder online. And once the editing of \"Lectures from a Disciple, Volume 3 is finished and is proofread, work will also begin with the translation and prepress work for that new publication in Russian.</p>\r\n<p>Also during this past week, I was in regular contact with devotees in the United States helping them set up a mailorder department, mainly for English publications. But until a mailorder department for Russian books can be set up in the CIS, the U.S. mailorder department will also be handling Russian publications and will ship them internationally at the lowest possible cost per book.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, this past week I was dealing with matters related to the development of another website, www.niranjanaswami.com. The main purpose of this new site is to make Gauranga Press publications available to those who are not registered users of http://nrs.iskconboston.org. It will also serve as a referral site for those who may be looking for this site but cannot find it because it's password protected and set up only for registered users. There will also be access on that site to a small amount of material which is not available on this site. The site is already in both English and Russian, though the Russian mailorder section will not be set up until more Russian books are available. </p>\r\n<p>This other site was established a few years ago by Hrsikesa dasa, a devotee in the New York area, before Gangambupada Prabhu set up http://nrs.iskconboston.org.  He intended to host podcasts of mine and other material. But because http://nrs.iskconboston.org started to become more popular, the site became inactive and was eventually even closed down by the company which hosted it. Working together with Hrsikesa dasa and other devotees in Kiev over the past week, we managed to get something set up once again so that it can be used in the above-mentioned ways.</p>\r\n<p>It is not at all my intention to suggest any shift of material from this site to the new site.

This site, http://nrs.iskconboston.org, will continue hosting everything that it has hosted up until now, and hopefully, including my blogs, as I start writing them once again.</p>\r\n<p>Now that May has arrived, I'm sure that many of you must be wondering when the next health update will appear.

She was surrounded by her devotee friends including her husband Shrutakirti das. Hundreds of devotees had visited her in her last days.  From the language of astrology we can see just how special she was to Lord Krishna.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In January, she asked Srutakirti to write to us to decide whether the painful treatments modern medicine prescribes would be worthwhile. Abhaya Mudra Dasi and I looked at the stars and advised her not to bother but to only shelter in Krishna’s name.  Thinking of her a few days back, I wrote her a letter, and twelve hours after I sent it, she left her body.  Since we are getting older now, the end is drawing near for the first generation of the Hare Krishna Movement as the next able generation has accepted this mantle of responsibility.  I would like to share our letter with the devotees.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">My dear Amekhala devi dasi,</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Please accept my humble obeisances.  I am so happy at your wonderful good fortune.  By Srila Prabhupada's divine mercy, Lord Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is inviting you Back to Home, Back to Godhead during His favorite month, Purushottama.  The Sun is in Uttarayana as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No one can know you but your spiritual master and Shri Kishna.  Others will go their own way, only the Guru Maharaja knows the heart of the disciple.  Now your material sojourn is behind you and you are on your way to join Krishna in Vrindavana.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So now, please just forget about everything here because you are going there too.  Have no fear and no attachment for this world. Remember us only as your eternal friends in the Spiritual Sky and we will all join you there very soon, soon enough.  Please let go of all material attachment.  We are all spirit souls, parts and parcels of Lord Shri Krishna, His eternal servants sheltered by the divine power of His Holy Names.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You are a kind, compassionate and good person at heart and Shri Krishna knows your heart. Now please make up your mind only to go to Him, through the divine loving grace of Shrila Prabhupada.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">See you soon enough, sister,<br />\r\nPatita Pavana das</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After Amekhala departed, Srutakirti Prabhu wrote me with the details, and a portion of Srutakirti’s letter is given hereunder:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dear Patita Pavana Prabhu,</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Please accept my humble obeisances.i</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">She has had hundreds of devotees pass through the hospice in the last few days she was there.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Of course she wanted that her leaving in the UK be a reason for everyone to come to the Manor to glorify Srila Prabhupada, a way to bring the community together. Something that was very important to her.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">She took her last breath at 5:56 a.m. It was without any strain. If you blinked you would have missed it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There was no gasping for a last breath and no pushing from her last breath. It was simple, profound and ladylike. We were happy that Radhanatha Maharaja made it here in time to visit her and speak about her in class on Friday evening.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With affection your servant and friend,</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Srutakirti das </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now let us have a look at the stars under which Amekhala left our limited vision.  As stated, she departed during the Uttarayana or “northern path of the Sun”.  Bhishma, the great warrior and mahajana, had to rest on a painful bed of arrows for over a month in order to leave during Uttarayana.  Amekhala met all criteria for liberation--as per Krishna’s instructions to Arjuna--and then much, much more. Not only was the Moon in the auspicious shukla-paksha phase, or waxing fortnight, but Amekhala left on the auspicious dashami day preceding holy Padmini Ekadashi, the day of Lord Hari. </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As noted above, the month, still running, is the rare intercalary Purushottama-masa, Lord Vishnu’s favorite which occurs once in three years. She left this world exactly at the juncture between Brahma muhurta and Sunrise with the Sun in his northern progress, or daytime of the demi-gods.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Vedic astrology, the Sun is called the atmakaraka, or “planet of the soul”.  Lord Surya Narayana, who appeared in the lagna or “house of self” in the chart or kundali of her disappearance, is only one degree from the highest point of exaltation, which is 10º Aries, Mesha rashi.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The phenomenon of the Sun occupying at or near his point of extreme elevation at sunrise--atmakaraka in the atmastan--occurs only for a few hours in a solar year.  Who but the self-realized could depart under such conditions?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The bright kundali is decorated with several other telling details, such as Budha in ucchamsa in conjunction with the Sun, but are too technical for a general explanation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Who can describe the glories of leaving this Earth under such rare stars and exalted muhurta?  Even great yogis are denied leaving this world during such conditions.  The final statement is the most profound.  Only the rarest of souls would be allowed to leave at such a moment because such a fortunate mahatma is certainly granted the eternal shelter of Shri Krishna. </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As Shrutakirti Prabhu pointed out, Amekhala wanted her departure to be an example for us, her Godbrothers and -sisters languishing behind in the world of birth and death.  In that our Godsister has succeeded beyond the powers of all imagination.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Amekhala’s life and transition to the next world forces us to ask ourselves about the spiritual identities of those who follow Shrila Prabhupada.  Prabhupada often said that his disciples--his “nice boys and girls”--are “not ordinary mahatmas, but they are sudurlabha mahatmas”.  In fact, Prabhupada, who appeared to the average man as a mere householder-turned-Indian-Swami, was not even an ordinary Jagat Guru.  Shrila Prabhupada was the Acharya of World Acharyas. The closer we disciples and ISKCON members can co-operate with one another, the sooner history will verify his position as a shaktyavesh avatara and personal direct associate of Lord Chaitanya’s sankirtan.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Therefore it follows that understanding the most exalted position of our spiritual master means understanding the position of those who serve His Divine Grace with every breath, even their last one.  For me, this is the parting message of our beloved and rare Godsister, Shrimati Amhekala devi dasi, beloved daughter of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

				"value": "<p>Prabhupada Memories — 4<br />\r\nGiriraj Swami<br />\r\nJanuary 12, 2010<br />\r\nKiev</p>\r\n<p>Tonight I shall speak about Srila Prabhupada’s dear friend and staunch devotee Mr. P. L. Sethi. When Srila Prabhupada first came to Bombay with his disciples from America, Mr. Sethi read a notice about them in the newspaper, which said that Srila Prabhupada had arrived with sadhus from foreign countries who chanted the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Mr. Sethi was part of a group that also chanted Hare Krsna, and so he wanted to meet Prabhupada, and he got the address and came to see him.</p>\r\n<p>At their first meeting, Srila Prabhupada asked Mr. Sethi what he did during the day, starting from when he woke up in the morning. Mr. Sethi began, “I get up, brush my teeth, take my bath, have a cup of tea and a piece of toast, read the newspaper, and go to work.” Srila Prabhupada said, “What is the difference between you and a pig?” [laughter] Mr. Sethi thought about it and seemed to agree [laughter]. So he asked Prabhupada, “What should I do?” And Prabhupada replied, “You should invite the devotees to Goregaon [the northern suburb of Bombay where Mr. Sethi lived] early every Sunday morning to do hari-nama-sankirtana, and then you should feed them sumptuous prasada.” And this became a regular practice.</p>\r\n<p>Later, when Srila Prabhupada got the Juhu property, Mr. Sethi bought some land behind it and built a house for his family. In India people often give names to their houses and office buildings, and he named his new home “Vrndavana.”</p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada underwent a great struggle to get the Juhu land and then to get the permissions to build on the land. Mr. Sethi was a building contractor, and Srila Prabhupada engaged him in getting permits and doing some of the early construction. At the back of the land were six two-storey apartment buildings, and before we got permission to build the temple and main project, Mr. Sethi got permission to add one storey on top of each of the buildings at the back. The roofs of those old buildings were flat, with little white ceramic tile chips set in cement, and Srila Prabhupada that said we should keep that flooring and build the walls and roof over it. </p>\r\n<p>When the first additional quarters were ready, Mr. Sethi took Srila Prabhupada on a tour. Srila Prabhupada looked at Mr. Sethi with great affection and said, “Just as you are building these rooms for my disciples here, Krsna is building your rooms for you in Vaikuntha, the spiritual world.” </p>\r\n<p>But we still did not have permission to build the main project. Finally, Mr. Sethi told Prabhupada, “Unless we pay them some money, we can’t get the permission.” He wanted to know if Prabhupada was willing to do that. Srila Prabhupada asked, “How much?” Mr. Sethi said, “Five thousand rupees.” Srila Prabhupada asked, “How do we know that if we pay the money we’ll get the permission?” Mr. Sethi said, “The municipal commissioner is the final authority, and he seems to be a decent man, and this is how it works in Bombay.” Srila Prabhupada said, “Let me think about it; I will tell you tomorrow morning.”</p>\r\n<p>After Mr. Sethi left, Srila Prabhupada discussed the matter with me and maybe one or two other managers of the Juhu project. “So, what should we do?” he asked. And he raised another question: “What if we give the money to Sethi and he doesn’t give it to the commissioner?” He quoted a Bengali saying that a goldsmith, while fashioning some gold his mother gave him to make into a ring, is thinking, “Should I use all the gold for the ring or put some in my pocket?” Prabhupada said that this type of cheating is so much a part of the goldsmith’s business that even if his own mother gives him gold to make an ornament, he will think, “Should I cheat and keep some of the gold for myself?” Prabhupada said that the construction business—paying bribes and getting permits—is such that someone in it will automatically think, “Should I keep some of the money for myself?”—no matter whose money it is.</p>\r\n<p>So there were many factors to consider—whether Mr. Sethi would give the money, or the full amount, to the commissioner, whether the commissioner, having taken the money, would in fact give the permission, or whether he might take the amount and then ask for more and more and more—so many complexities. Finally Srila Prabhupada decided, “We will not do this.” </p>\r\n<p>We were a little apprehensive about how Srila Prabhupada would present his decision to Mr. Sethi and how Mr. Sethi would take it. And the next morning we waited anxiously for Mr. Sethi to arrive. Eventually he came and, as usual, sat on the floor before Srila Prabhupada. “So, what do you think?” Prabhupada asked. “Should we do it?” Mr. Sethi replied, “Yes, because otherwise we are not getting the permission.” Prabhupada immediately said, “All right”—just the opposite of the way the discussion had been going the day before. So Prabhupada arranged the money, and we got the permission. </p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada, as the acarya, was teaching us. He often told us that intelligence means to see the same thing from many points of view and that we should do everything very cautiously and carefully. I do not believe that he actually doubted his dear friend and staunch devotee Mr. Sethi, but he was teaching us to be circumspect and consider every proposal with keen intelligence. </p>\r\n<p>There were many complications in the history of the struggle to get the Juhu land and build the temple, but tonight we shall focus on Mr. Sethi and his service to and relationship with Srila Prabhupada.</p>\r\n<p>In the course of the struggle, the municipality had demolished the semi-permanent temple we had built for Radha-Rasabihari. At first, we actively campaigned to get permission to rebuild it. But eventually we concluded that we didn’t really need a permit to rebuild it, because we already had permission and the municipality didn’t actually have valid grounds for demolishing it. Still, the landlady, Mrs. Nair, somehow heard about our intention and went to the court to get an injunction to stop us from rebuilding the temple. That was on a Friday, and the judge said he would not give the injunction without hearing us. She said, “Just give a temporary injunction for the weekend and then you can decide on the permanent injunction.” But he said, “No, without hearing the other side I will not pass any judgment.” So we knew we had the weekend to rebuild the temple, because once it was rebuilt, the injunction would be meaningless.</p>\r\n<p>In those days it was difficult to get cement, and a little hard to get bricks. The supply was less than the demand. And the government has imposed “cement control”: to purchase cement legally, one had to procure a government-approved quota. But Mr. Sethi brought cement and bricks from his own construction sites, so we could rebuild the temple over the weekend. While the work was going on, Mr. Mhatre, the local municipal counselor, who was in cahoots with Mrs. Nair, came to the site and demanded, “You stop the construction immediately.” Mr. Sethi replied, “No. Why should we stop?” Mr. Mhatre threatened, “Well, you can build it up, but I will come in the night with fifty gundas [hooligans] and break it down.” And Mr. Sethi turned to his son, who was by his side, and said, “Brij Mohan, bring my revolver and my rifle.” Then Mr. Sethi said to Mhatre, “Don’t bring fifty gundas. Bring a hundred. Bring two hundred. I have two hundred and fifty cartridges.” He was that staunch. Then he and his son—he with rifle in hand, his son with revolver—stayed up all night, in the pouring rain, to complete and protect the project. And no one came to disturb the work.</p>\r\n<p>On Monday morning we appeared in court and told the judge that the temple had already been rebuilt. And the judge said to Mrs. Nair, “What is built is built. No one can destroy the temple.”</p>\r\n<p>Eventually we did get permission to build the main complex. The question then became whether we needed piling. Piles are columns of reinforced concrete driven into the ground to support a building’s foundation. Generally, to determine if you need piles or how strong the piles must be, you hire a soil-testing company to drill into the earth and see how far down you have to go to reach bedrock. And because the Juhu land was near the beach, it was expected that the soil would be sandy, with water underneath, and that we would need piles, which would be quite an expense. Mr. Sethi approached Prabhupada, who replied, “No, we don’t require piles.” Still, Mr. Sethi had some doubt, and he didn’t want to take any chances, so he hired a soil-testing company. </p>\r\n<p>When the specialized machinery was drilling into the earth and had gone only about four feet deep, it hit bedrock. In fact, when it hit the hard rock, the drill broke. Nobody had expected to hit bedrock so soon. This was one of many, many instances that increased Mr. Sethi’s faith in Srila Prabhupada. He felt that Srila Prabhupada knew everything. </p>\r\n<p>Once, Mr. Sethi approached Srila Prabhupada to stage a charity benefit. The idea was that some famous artists—singers, dancers, musicians—would present an Indian cultural show, we would sell tickets, and the proceeds would go to the temple. Srila Prabhupada replied, “Yes, you can do. If you can make money from the performance, it will be most welcome.” Then Mr. Sethi added, “The only thing, Prabhupada, is we will need some devotees to sell tickets.” Srila Prabhupada replied, “Our devotees cannot sell tickets. They are meant for selling books.” He said that if Mr. Sethi and his friends promoted the program and gave the profit to the temple, he would have no objection, but that the devotees could not be directly involved. </p>\r\n<p>Another time, Mr. Sethi had some ideas for other ways the devotees could make money for the project. Srila Prabhupada replied, “Your ideas may be good, but if I tell my disciples, they will think, ‘I have come for bhajana, and now he wants me to do the same business again.’” And Srila Prabhupada told a story. Once, a boy was learning algebra and his mother saw him write A + B = C. Seeing the letters A, B, and C, she exclaimed, “Oh, you have grown so much, and still you are doing the same ABC?” She could not understand there was a gulf of difference between this ABC and that ABC, between a child’s learning to write the alphabet—ABC—and an adult’s doing algebra—ABC. Prabhupada continued, “I can give my disciples so many ideas, but they will think, ‘I have come for bhajana, and again I am doing the same business?’ They cannot understand there is a gulf of difference between this business and that business—between working for Krsna and working for maya.”</p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada knew our consciousness, the defects in our understanding. But he did not disturb us. He encouraged us to continue in devotional service, and he maintained faith that the process of hearing and chanting about Krsna and serving Lord Krsna’s mission would purify us and enlighten us in the proper understanding of Krsna consciousness.</p>\r\n<p>When we discuss Srila Prabhupada’s statements on different topics, we may contemplate only some of what he was thinking. He very well could have had other thoughts that he did not express to us. So it requires some depth of realization to understand and appreciate, to whatever degree we can, why Srila Prabhupada said or did something. We must be attuned to Srila Prabhupada’s inner mood and thoughts. </p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada said that there are three categories of disciples. The first-class disciple knows what the spiritual master wants even before the spiritual master tells him. The second-class disciple receives an instruction from the spiritual master and executes it perfectly. And the third-class disciple receives an instruction and, as Prabhupada put it, says, “Yes, Srila Prabhupada,” leaves the room, and halfway down the stairs thinks, “What was it that Prabhupada wanted me to do?” </p>\r\n<p>Later, I found the corresponding verse in Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.18.44):</p>\r\n<p>uttamas cintitam kuryat<br />\r\n prokta-kari tu madhyamah<br />\r\nadhamo ’sraddhaya kuryad<br />\r\n akartoccaritam pituh</p>\r\n<p>“A son who acts by anticipating what his father wants him to do is first class, one who acts upon receiving his father’s order is second class, and one who executes his father’s order irreverently is third class. But a son who refuses his father’s order is like his father’s stool.”</p>\r\n<p>As Srimad-Bhagavatam suggests, the third-class disciple will get an instruction and then argue about it or begrudge having to execute it. </p>\r\n<p>In general, we should try to act on the second-class platform: we should receive the instruction and execute it perfectly. If we are not actually on the first-class platform, we may speculate about what the spiritual master wants and then make mistakes. As Srila Prabhupada said, “If the spiritual master asks for water and you bring milk, thinking that milk is better than water—that is not service.” In other words, one should do just what the spiritual master asks. Still, if one is blessed by the spiritual master to understand his heart, one can do what the spiritual master wants even without being told.</p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada would become very upset with his disciple Bhargava dasa, a BBT photographer, when Bhargava snapped pictures of him while he was speaking. Once, in South Africa, when Bhargava clicked a photo, Prabhupada stopped his talk and told Bhargava, “What do you get by taking photos while I am speaking? I have repeatedly asked you. Don’t take while I am talking. It disturbs me. My attention goes to your photograph. It is very much disturbing.”</p>\r\n<p>Another time, Bhargava took a photo and so disturbed Srila Prabhupada that he told Bhargava, “Get out and don’t come back!” Bhargava’s mind was set in turmoil. He left the temple and began to walk. He was just walking and walking and walking. He didn’t know where he was going or what he would do. He was just walking. Meanwhile, when it was time for the evening program, Prabhupada asked, “Where is Bhargava?” Nobody knew. So devotees fanned out to look for him. Eventually, late at night, after the program was over, they found him and brought him back.</p>\r\n<p>Prabhupada asked him, “Why weren’t you at the program tonight?” And Bhargava replied, “Well, you told me not to come.” Prabhupada said, “I never said that.” [laughter] And then he said, “And even if I did, still you should have come.” </p>\r\n<p>We are speaking about knowing the heart of the spiritual master. And of course, if we do not really know his heart, we should not speculate and risk disobeying or offending him. But I am taking the chance and speaking about first-class service in the hope that there will be some devotees who can come to understand what the spiritual master wants even without his telling them. </p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada was very personal in his dealings with his disciples. Although he was the world acarya, he had individual relationships with individual disciples, and one of them was Bhargava Prabhu. </p>\r\n<p>In Los Angeles recently, Bhargava told me that once, Prabhupada had told him, “You are useless.” And those words, coming from Srila Prabhupada, had weighed on Bhargava’s mind. Finally, months later, when Bhargava was alone with His Divine Grace at Bhaktivedanta Manor, he got the chance to ask about it. “Srila Prabhupada, you said that I was useless. Is that true?” Prabhupada paused for some moments and replied, “Everything has some use.” [laughter]</p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada’s dealings with Mr. Sethi were different. Although Prabhupada loved all his disciples, he expressed his love and care for them in different ways. A parent may give bitter medicine to a child, out of love, for the child’s benefit, and the same parent, to encourage a child, may, out of love, give a sweet. Srila Prabhupada dealt lovingly with everyone, but he exhibited his love differently with different people and in different situations.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, we did get the permission and build the temple complex in Juhu, and Saurabha Prabhu arranged beautiful quarters for Srila Prabhupada on the top floor of the western tower, facing the sea. After Srila Prabhupada moved in, he invited Mr. Sethi to see his new accommodations. He told Mr. Sethi, “Just see what beautiful arrangements my disciples have made for me—spacious rooms with beautiful chandeliers and carved-wood furniture and marble floors.” Then Prabhupada said to Mr. Sethi, “I always wanted you to live with us, but you always felt that the conditions would be too austere for you. You weren’t used to living so simply. So you come and live here in my quarters, and I will stay somewhere else.” Mr. Sethi protested, “No, no, your disciples have made this for you.” Prabhupada said, “I am a sannyasi; I can stay anywhere. You stay here.” That was Prabhupada’s generosity of spirit and his graciousness toward Mr. Sethi.</p>\r\n<p>Soon thereafter, Srila Prabhupada left this world, but Mr. Sethi continued his service. He arranged and paid for a beautiful, ornate pure silver arati set for offering guru-puja to Srila Prabhupada. And every year on Prabhupada’s appearance and disappearance days he would sponsor a grand, opulent feast for everyone who came to the temple. Later, he created sizable fixed deposits in the bank, the interest from which would pay for opulent feasts on Prabhupada’s appearance and disappearance days in perpetuity. And he contributed for the construction of two guest rooms, the rent from which would sponsor Srila Prabhupada’s annual appearance and disappearance festivals. </p>\r\n<p>Then, last year, Mr. Sethi became ill. He was eighty-eight, but he had no fear of death. He was completely detached from the body. Devotees constantly surrounded him with kirtana. His spiritual and biological families—everyone—was so attached to him. It is really powerful when the head of a family is such a staunch devotee. Sethiji’s wife is also a very good devotee. His sons and daughters and grandchildren—the whole, large family—is Krsna conscious. Their affection for him was exceptionally strong, with a familial relationship based on his being husband, father, and grandfather, and a spiritual relationship based on his bringing them to Srila Prabhupada and inspiring them in Krsna consciousness. </p>\r\n<p>Then, on February 12, he began to say, “Prabhupada is calling me. He is preparing a room for me, and when it is ready he will take me. I am going from where I came, back to my guruji.” On February 13, he insisted on going to the temple. And three days later, at 11 p.m., surrounded by devotees lovingly chanting the holy names of Krsna in kirtana, he left his body to rejoin Srila Prabhupada. He was so fixed in service and devotion to Srila Prabhupada that at the very end his mind was fixed on Srila Prabhupada.</p>\r\n<p>Once, Mr. Sethi told Srila Prabhupada that sometimes devotees would ask him why he didn’t get initiated. Prabhupada replied, “You are better than initiated. An initiated disciple can serve Krsna, worship the Deity, but you are serving the servants of Krsna, and that is higher.” And he quoted the verse,</p>\r\n<p>aradhananam sarvesam<br />\r\n visnor aradhanam param<br />\r\ntasmat parataram devi<br />\r\n tadiyanam samarcanam</p>\r\n<p>“Of all kinds of worship, the worship of Lord Visnu, or Krsna, is the topmost. But above even the worship of Lord Visnu is the rendering of service to Vaisnavas, who are related to Visnu.” (Padma Purana)</p>\r\n<p>And Prabhupada added, “Beside, I have much work for you. There may be things I want you to do that would be awkward for an initiated disciple, but as you are now, you can do them conveniently.” </p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada was very liberal. He knew the heart—the devotion, the service—of the person, and he accepted Mr. Sethi as more than an initiated disciple. And there is no doubt that Mr. Sethi’s attachment to Srila Prabhupada and Srila Prabhupada’s service and his fixed consciousness on Srila Prabhupada at the end have carried him to Srila Prabhupada again.</p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada ki jaya!<br />\r\nMr. Sethi ki jaya!</p>\r\n<p>Devotee: Can we draw an analogy between Mr. Sethi and George Harrison, between the relationship between Srila Prabhupada and Mr. Sethi and the relationship between Srila Prabhupada and George Harrison?</p>\r\n<p>Giriraj Swami: That’s a good point. When I was saying how Srila Prabhupada was very liberal and knew the heart of a person and wasn’t so concerned with initiation, I actually thought of George Harrison. At an early stage, George asked Prabhupada if he should shave his head and move into the temple, and Prabhupada replied, “No, you should remain as a Beatle and write songs about Krsna.” Prabhupada may have seen that George could do more to spread the Krsna consciousness movement as he was, as a Beatle, than he could as an initiated devotee.</p>\r\n<p>Here I recall two small incidents that involved Mr. Sethi and Srila Prabhupada in Chandigarh. Mr. Sethi was from Punjab and had a home in the capital, Chandigarh. He very much supported the devotees’ efforts to establish ISKCON in Chandigarh. He hosted them in his house, worked toward the acquisition of land, and contributed to the development of the project on the land. </p>\r\n<p>In 1976 Prabhupada’s disciples arranged a huge pandal program in Chandigarh, and many important people—ministers and government officers—participated. One of the big ministers on the stage with Prabhupada looked at his watch and told Prabhupada that he had to leave. Srila Prabhupada whispered to Mr. Sethi, “He’s drunk and wants to go home to sleep.” Mr. Sethi escorted the minister to his car, and on the way he actually smelled the alcohol on the minister’s breath. This was another incident that increased Mr. Sethi’s faith in Srila Prabhupada, that Prabhupada knew everything. </p>\r\n<p>Later, the chief minister came to meet Srila Prabhupada, and he requested a copy of the Bhagavad-gita As It Is. The chief minister was very respectful toward the Gita, and as Mr. Sethi described it, he left Prabhupada’s room carrying the Gita on his head. After he left, Prabhupada told Mr. Sethi, “Because he has given the highest respect to the Bhagavad-gita, he will be given the highest respect in India.” In time, that chief minister, Giani Zail Singh, became the seventh president of India. And Mr. Sethi attributed his rise to the position of the highest respect in India to Srila Prabhupada’s blessing.</p>\r\n<p>So, this is the story of one sincere, humble devotee’s service to Srila Prabhupada and Srila Prabhupada’s immense mercy and blessings upon him. And somehow or other, that same, immense mercy from Srila Prabhupada is available to all of us who are serving him and his mission even now. </p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna.</p>\r\n<p>Devotee: How did your parents react when you became a devotee?</p>\r\n<p>Giriraj Swami: I was a university student in Boston when I met Srila Prabhupada and joined the temple. Just before I was due to graduate, Srila Prabhupada spoke at my university, and soon thereafter I accepted him as my spiritual master. About two months later my parents came for my graduation ceremony, and they were shocked to see what had become of me [laughter]. At that time my service in the temple was peeling potatoes and cutting vegetables in the kitchen. My father said, “I spent so much money on your education. You came this far to peel potatoes?” [laughter] To him, it was the same ABC. He couldn’t understand that there was a gulf of difference between this ABC and that ABC.</p>\r\n<p>So it was a shock, and they were quite concerned about me. Many little incidents took place. Then eventually I went to India. And in 1971 my parents came to meet me there—in Calcutta. In Boston my father had said, “If you leave this and come back, I will give you a million dollars,” which was really a lot of money then. Then they came to Calcutta and met Srila Prabhupada. </p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada was so expert. He told this brilliantly constructed story about his life in Allahabad when he had a pharmacy. Motilal Nehru—the father of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India—had been one of Prabhupada’s customers. Motilal Nehru, Prabhupada said, would come to his pharmacy and complain about his son, who according to his father was useless. So Motilal offered his son to the freedom movement.</p>\r\n<p>Prabhupada also mentioned how both the father and son had a prejudice in favor of England and against India. He said that if they could purchase the exact same medicine made in India and made in England, the Nehrus would get the one from England at ten times the cost. The medicine was the same, but the words “Made in England” made all the difference.</p>\r\n<p>The whole story was fascinating, but in a subtle way Srila Prabhupada was preaching to my father and attacking some of his natural prejudices and sentiments. People tend to think that if someone holds an important material position—like prime minister—he must be someone special. But indirectly Prabhupada was saying that Nehru was a useless fellow. “Don’t put your faith in him.” Most Europeans and Americas then (and perhaps even now) had a prejudice against India. They thought that they were better than Indians, that India was backward and that Europe and America were more advanced. Prabhupada also attacked that prejudice, to make my father more open to Krsna consciousness. </p>\r\n<p>After Srila Prabhupada finished his story and told the devotees in the room to leave, my father told Srila Prabhupada that he wanted me back. He said, “I want to establish a trust in my son’s name, and I want to put a million dollars in it.” Prabhupada said, “All right.” And then my father said, “But I want Glenn to come home to sign the papers.” Prabhupada said, “You can send the papers here and he will sign.” </p>\r\n<p>My parents tried different approaches. They had met a very wealthy, aristocratic gentleman who lived in a beautiful suburb, the best suburb of Calcutta. His name was C. L. Bajoria, and he was a good friend of mine. They spent half a day with him and were very happy to have met him. It was said he owned one quarter of Darjeeling. </p>\r\n<p>So, my parents said to Srila Prabhupada, “Mr. Bajoria is a devotee, but he lives at home. He has a regular life. Why can’t Glenn also be a devotee and live at home?” Prabhupada said, “Well, he is not exactly a devotee like my disciples, but he has been touched by Krsna consciousness.” My father objected, “But still, you can be Krsna conscious at home. So why can’t Glenn be Krsna conscious at home?” And Prabhupada replied, “It is a matter of association. Here he gets the association of devotees. If he goes back to Chicago, he won’t have such association.” </p>\r\n<p>My mother saw the direction that the conversation was going, so she started to cry. Earlier, my parents had brought up the subject of protein. They were concerned that I wouldn’t get enough protein in my diet, because in those days people thought if you didn’t eat meat you wouldn’t get enough protein. Srila Prabhupada had a container of sandesa on his table, and so he put some sandesa in my father’s hand and in my mother’s hand. He wanted to pacify them with the spiritual potency of prasada. Then he said, “These sweets are made of pure cheese. They are full of protein.” And then he said to me, “You must eat two dozen sandesa and rasagulla every day.” [laughter] </p>\r\n<p>He could see that especially my mother was very concerned about my health. So he said, “Let your son stay with me until April and then, when I come to the West, he can come with me.” We were in October. So I said, “Actually, this is a very good plan, because right now it is very cold in America, especially in Chicago. So I can stay with Prabhupada when it’s cold in America and then when it gets hot in India and is pleasant in America I can come with him.” I said, “Srila Prabhupada is very intelligent, so he plans his schedule to be in India when it’s pleasant in the winter and cold in America, and to be in America when it is pleasant in the summer and too hot in India.” And my father said, “Yes, he is very intelligent.” Then Prabhupada said, “Your son is intelligent, because he has understood my motive in planning my schedule.” My father insisted, “No, you are intelligent.” Then Prabhupada said, “Well, I guess I must be intelligent; otherwise how could I attract so many intelligent young women and men like your son?” </p>\r\n<p>So it was all settled: I would stay with Prabhupada and come with him to America in April. In the meantime, Prabhupada said, he would take personal care of me and make sure that I ate enough rasagulla and sandesa. And as we were leaving Prabhupada’s room, walking out onto the balcony, my father expressed his appreciation for Srila Prabhupada. He said, “I’ll say two things about your master. He is a brilliant organizer, and he really knows how to deal with people.” And in my father’s value system, those were very high compliments.</p>\r\n<p>I’ll tell one last little anecdote. In 1973 I actually did get sick, with jaundice, and Srila Prabhupada said that as long as I remained in Bombay I wouldn’t be able to recover. So I went to Los Angeles, and my parents and sister came to meet me there. One day my parents and I accompanied Srila Prabhupada on his morning walk. Prabhupada was so gracious and charming, not just to my parents but to everyone. Our scientist Svarupa Damodara was there, and some book distributors and managers, and Prabhupada just completely charmed and engaged everyone. When he saw my mother he said, “Oh, Mrs. Teton, you look so young.” And he consulted my father about some legal matters, because my father was a lawyer. </p>\r\n<p>Then at the end of the walk we came to the parking lot. The devotees had arranged a Rolls Royce for Srila Prabhupada, and my father was eyeing the Rolls Royce. Srila Prabhupada could see that, and in a very shy, humble way, said, “My disciples have arranged this for me.” My father immediately responded, “No, no, you deserve it. You deserve it.” [laughter] And then Prabhupada said to him, “You can ride with me. You come with me.” But my father declined, “No, we have our own rented car.”</p>\r\n<p>Then what I heard later is very significant. Prabhupada’s servant said to him, “Srila Prabhupada, everyone likes you so much.” And Prabhupada said, “Yes, because I like everyone.” And he really did.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your attention, your hospitality, your affection, and your wonderful service. You are in very good hands with His Holiness Niranjana Swami and His Grace Acyuta Priya Prabhu and the other leaders here, and the sannyasis and senior preachers who come to visit. So please continue to serve Srila Prabhupada and his representatives and chant nicely, dance nicely, and eat nicely. Be happy in Krsna consciousness, and help make others happy by bringing them to Krsna consciousness. Hare Krsna.</p>\r\n<p>Srila Prabhupada ki jaya!</p>",

				"safe_value": "<p>Prabhupada Memories — 4<br />\nGiriraj Swami<br />\nJanuary 12, 2010<br />\nKiev</p>\n<p>Tonight I shall speak about Srila Prabhupada’s dear friend and staunch devotee Mr. P. L. Sethi. When Srila Prabhupada first came to Bombay with his disciples from America, Mr. Sethi read a notice about them in the newspaper, which said that Srila Prabhupada had arrived with sadhus from foreign countries who chanted the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Mr. Sethi was part of a group that also chanted Hare Krsna, and so he wanted to meet Prabhupada, and he got the address and came to see him.</p>\n<p>At their first meeting, Srila Prabhupada asked Mr. Sethi what he did during the day, starting from when he woke up in the morning. Mr. Sethi began, “I get up, brush my teeth, take my bath, have a cup of tea and a piece of toast, read the newspaper, and go to work.” Srila Prabhupada said, “What is the difference between you and a pig?” [laughter] Mr. Sethi thought about it and seemed to agree [laughter]. So he asked Prabhupada, “What should I do?” And Prabhupada replied, “You should invite the devotees to Goregaon [the northern suburb of Bombay where Mr. Sethi lived] early every Sunday morning to do hari-nama-sankirtana, and then you should feed them sumptuous prasada.” And this became a regular practice.</p>\n<p>Later, when Srila Prabhupada got the Juhu property, Mr. Sethi bought some land behind it and built a house for his family. In India people often give names to their houses and office buildings, and he named his new home “Vrndavana.”</p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada underwent a great struggle to get the Juhu land and then to get the permissions to build on the land. Mr. Sethi was a building contractor, and Srila Prabhupada engaged him in getting permits and doing some of the early construction. At the back of the land were six two-storey apartment buildings, and before we got permission to build the temple and main project, Mr. Sethi got permission to add one storey on top of each of the buildings at the back. The roofs of those old buildings were flat, with little white ceramic tile chips set in cement, and Srila Prabhupada that said we should keep that flooring and build the walls and roof over it. </p>\n<p>When the first additional quarters were ready, Mr. Sethi took Srila Prabhupada on a tour. Srila Prabhupada looked at Mr. Sethi with great affection and said, “Just as you are building these rooms for my disciples here, Krsna is building your rooms for you in Vaikuntha, the spiritual world.” </p>\n<p>But we still did not have permission to build the main project. Finally, Mr. Sethi told Prabhupada, “Unless we pay them some money, we can’t get the permission.” He wanted to know if Prabhupada was willing to do that. Srila Prabhupada asked, “How much?” Mr. Sethi said, “Five thousand rupees.” Srila Prabhupada asked, “How do we know that if we pay the money we’ll get the permission?” Mr. Sethi said, “The municipal commissioner is the final authority, and he seems to be a decent man, and this is how it works in Bombay.” Srila Prabhupada said, “Let me think about it; I will tell you tomorrow morning.”</p>\n<p>After Mr. Sethi left, Srila Prabhupada discussed the matter with me and maybe one or two other managers of the Juhu project. “So, what should we do?” he asked. And he raised another question: “What if we give the money to Sethi and he doesn’t give it to the commissioner?” He quoted a Bengali saying that a goldsmith, while fashioning some gold his mother gave him to make into a ring, is thinking, “Should I use all the gold for the ring or put some in my pocket?” Prabhupada said that this type of cheating is so much a part of the goldsmith’s business that even if his own mother gives him gold to make an ornament, he will think, “Should I cheat and keep some of the gold for myself?” Prabhupada said that the construction business—paying bribes and getting permits—is such that someone in it will automatically think, “Should I keep some of the money for myself?”—no matter whose money it is.</p>\n<p>So there were many factors to consider—whether Mr. Sethi would give the money, or the full amount, to the commissioner, whether the commissioner, having taken the money, would in fact give the permission, or whether he might take the amount and then ask for more and more and more—so many complexities. Finally Srila Prabhupada decided, “We will not do this.” </p>\n<p>We were a little apprehensive about how Srila Prabhupada would present his decision to Mr. Sethi and how Mr. Sethi would take it. And the next morning we waited anxiously for Mr. Sethi to arrive. Eventually he came and, as usual, sat on the floor before Srila Prabhupada. “So, what do you think?” Prabhupada asked. “Should we do it?” Mr. Sethi replied, “Yes, because otherwise we are not getting the permission.” Prabhupada immediately said, “All right”—just the opposite of the way the discussion had been going the day before. So Prabhupada arranged the money, and we got the permission. </p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada, as the acarya, was teaching us. He often told us that intelligence means to see the same thing from many points of view and that we should do everything very cautiously and carefully. I do not believe that he actually doubted his dear friend and staunch devotee Mr. Sethi, but he was teaching us to be circumspect and consider every proposal with keen intelligence. </p>\n<p>There were many complications in the history of the struggle to get the Juhu land and build the temple, but tonight we shall focus on Mr. Sethi and his service to and relationship with Srila Prabhupada.</p>\n<p>In the course of the struggle, the municipality had demolished the semi-permanent temple we had built for Radha-Rasabihari. At first, we actively campaigned to get permission to rebuild it. But eventually we concluded that we didn’t really need a permit to rebuild it, because we already had permission and the municipality didn’t actually have valid grounds for demolishing it. Still, the landlady, Mrs. Nair, somehow heard about our intention and went to the court to get an injunction to stop us from rebuilding the temple. That was on a Friday, and the judge said he would not give the injunction without hearing us. She said, “Just give a temporary injunction for the weekend and then you can decide on the permanent injunction.” But he said, “No, without hearing the other side I will not pass any judgment.” So we knew we had the weekend to rebuild the temple, because once it was rebuilt, the injunction would be meaningless.</p>\n<p>In those days it was difficult to get cement, and a little hard to get bricks. The supply was less than the demand. And the government has imposed “cement control”: to purchase cement legally, one had to procure a government-approved quota. But Mr. Sethi brought cement and bricks from his own construction sites, so we could rebuild the temple over the weekend. While the work was going on, Mr. Mhatre, the local municipal counselor, who was in cahoots with Mrs. Nair, came to the site and demanded, “You stop the construction immediately.” Mr. Sethi replied, “No. Why should we stop?” Mr. Mhatre threatened, “Well, you can build it up, but I will come in the night with fifty gundas [hooligans] and break it down.” And Mr. Sethi turned to his son, who was by his side, and said, “Brij Mohan, bring my revolver and my rifle.” Then Mr. Sethi said to Mhatre, “Don’t bring fifty gundas. Bring a hundred. Bring two hundred. I have two hundred and fifty cartridges.” He was that staunch. Then he and his son—he with rifle in hand, his son with revolver—stayed up all night, in the pouring rain, to complete and protect the project. And no one came to disturb the work.</p>\n<p>On Monday morning we appeared in court and told the judge that the temple had already been rebuilt. And the judge said to Mrs. Nair, “What is built is built. No one can destroy the temple.”</p>\n<p>Eventually we did get permission to build the main complex. The question then became whether we needed piling. Piles are columns of reinforced concrete driven into the ground to support a building’s foundation. Generally, to determine if you need piles or how strong the piles must be, you hire a soil-testing company to drill into the earth and see how far down you have to go to reach bedrock. And because the Juhu land was near the beach, it was expected that the soil would be sandy, with water underneath, and that we would need piles, which would be quite an expense. Mr. Sethi approached Prabhupada, who replied, “No, we don’t require piles.” Still, Mr. Sethi had some doubt, and he didn’t want to take any chances, so he hired a soil-testing company. </p>\n<p>When the specialized machinery was drilling into the earth and had gone only about four feet deep, it hit bedrock. In fact, when it hit the hard rock, the drill broke. Nobody had expected to hit bedrock so soon. This was one of many, many instances that increased Mr. Sethi’s faith in Srila Prabhupada. He felt that Srila Prabhupada knew everything. </p>\n<p>Once, Mr. Sethi approached Srila Prabhupada to stage a charity benefit. The idea was that some famous artists—singers, dancers, musicians—would present an Indian cultural show, we would sell tickets, and the proceeds would go to the temple. Srila Prabhupada replied, “Yes, you can do. If you can make money from the performance, it will be most welcome.” Then Mr. Sethi added, “The only thing, Prabhupada, is we will need some devotees to sell tickets.” Srila Prabhupada replied, “Our devotees cannot sell tickets. They are meant for selling books.” He said that if Mr. Sethi and his friends promoted the program and gave the profit to the temple, he would have no objection, but that the devotees could not be directly involved. </p>\n<p>Another time, Mr. Sethi had some ideas for other ways the devotees could make money for the project. Srila Prabhupada replied, “Your ideas may be good, but if I tell my disciples, they will think, ‘I have come for bhajana, and now he wants me to do the same business again.’” And Srila Prabhupada told a story. Once, a boy was learning algebra and his mother saw him write A + B = C. Seeing the letters A, B, and C, she exclaimed, “Oh, you have grown so much, and still you are doing the same ABC?” She could not understand there was a gulf of difference between this ABC and that ABC, between a child’s learning to write the alphabet—ABC—and an adult’s doing algebra—ABC. Prabhupada continued, “I can give my disciples so many ideas, but they will think, ‘I have come for bhajana, and again I am doing the same business?’ They cannot understand there is a gulf of difference between this business and that business—between working for Krsna and working for maya.”</p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada knew our consciousness, the defects in our understanding. But he did not disturb us. He encouraged us to continue in devotional service, and he maintained faith that the process of hearing and chanting about Krsna and serving Lord Krsna’s mission would purify us and enlighten us in the proper understanding of Krsna consciousness.</p>\n<p>When we discuss Srila Prabhupada’s statements on different topics, we may contemplate only some of what he was thinking. He very well could have had other thoughts that he did not express to us. So it requires some depth of realization to understand and appreciate, to whatever degree we can, why Srila Prabhupada said or did something. We must be attuned to Srila Prabhupada’s inner mood and thoughts. </p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada said that there are three categories of disciples. The first-class disciple knows what the spiritual master wants even before the spiritual master tells him. The second-class disciple receives an instruction from the spiritual master and executes it perfectly. And the third-class disciple receives an instruction and, as Prabhupada put it, says, “Yes, Srila Prabhupada,” leaves the room, and halfway down the stairs thinks, “What was it that Prabhupada wanted me to do?” </p>\n<p>Later, I found the corresponding verse in Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.18.44):</p>\n<p>uttamas cintitam kuryat<br />\n prokta-kari tu madhyamah<br />\nadhamo ’sraddhaya kuryad<br />\n akartoccaritam pituh</p>\n<p>“A son who acts by anticipating what his father wants him to do is first class, one who acts upon receiving his father’s order is second class, and one who executes his father’s order irreverently is third class. But a son who refuses his father’s order is like his father’s stool.”</p>\n<p>As Srimad-Bhagavatam suggests, the third-class disciple will get an instruction and then argue about it or begrudge having to execute it. </p>\n<p>In general, we should try to act on the second-class platform: we should receive the instruction and execute it perfectly. If we are not actually on the first-class platform, we may speculate about what the spiritual master wants and then make mistakes. As Srila Prabhupada said, “If the spiritual master asks for water and you bring milk, thinking that milk is better than water—that is not service.” In other words, one should do just what the spiritual master asks. Still, if one is blessed by the spiritual master to understand his heart, one can do what the spiritual master wants even without being told.</p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada would become very upset with his disciple Bhargava dasa, a BBT photographer, when Bhargava snapped pictures of him while he was speaking. Once, in South Africa, when Bhargava clicked a photo, Prabhupada stopped his talk and told Bhargava, “What do you get by taking photos while I am speaking? I have repeatedly asked you. Don’t take while I am talking. It disturbs me. My attention goes to your photograph. It is very much disturbing.”</p>\n<p>Another time, Bhargava took a photo and so disturbed Srila Prabhupada that he told Bhargava, “Get out and don’t come back!” Bhargava’s mind was set in turmoil. He left the temple and began to walk. He was just walking and walking and walking. He didn’t know where he was going or what he would do. He was just walking. Meanwhile, when it was time for the evening program, Prabhupada asked, “Where is Bhargava?” Nobody knew. So devotees fanned out to look for him. Eventually, late at night, after the program was over, they found him and brought him back.</p>\n<p>Prabhupada asked him, “Why weren’t you at the program tonight?” And Bhargava replied, “Well, you told me not to come.” Prabhupada said, “I never said that.” [laughter] And then he said, “And even if I did, still you should have come.” </p>\n<p>We are speaking about knowing the heart of the spiritual master. And of course, if we do not really know his heart, we should not speculate and risk disobeying or offending him. But I am taking the chance and speaking about first-class service in the hope that there will be some devotees who can come to understand what the spiritual master wants even without his telling them. </p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada was very personal in his dealings with his disciples. Although he was the world acarya, he had individual relationships with individual disciples, and one of them was Bhargava Prabhu. </p>\n<p>In Los Angeles recently, Bhargava told me that once, Prabhupada had told him, “You are useless.” And those words, coming from Srila Prabhupada, had weighed on Bhargava’s mind. Finally, months later, when Bhargava was alone with His Divine Grace at Bhaktivedanta Manor, he got the chance to ask about it. “Srila Prabhupada, you said that I was useless. Is that true?” Prabhupada paused for some moments and replied, “Everything has some use.” [laughter]</p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada’s dealings with Mr. Sethi were different. Although Prabhupada loved all his disciples, he expressed his love and care for them in different ways. A parent may give bitter medicine to a child, out of love, for the child’s benefit, and the same parent, to encourage a child, may, out of love, give a sweet. Srila Prabhupada dealt lovingly with everyone, but he exhibited his love differently with different people and in different situations.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we did get the permission and build the temple complex in Juhu, and Saurabha Prabhu arranged beautiful quarters for Srila Prabhupada on the top floor of the western tower, facing the sea. After Srila Prabhupada moved in, he invited Mr. Sethi to see his new accommodations. He told Mr. Sethi, “Just see what beautiful arrangements my disciples have made for me—spacious rooms with beautiful chandeliers and carved-wood furniture and marble floors.” Then Prabhupada said to Mr. Sethi, “I always wanted you to live with us, but you always felt that the conditions would be too austere for you. You weren’t used to living so simply. So you come and live here in my quarters, and I will stay somewhere else.” Mr. Sethi protested, “No, no, your disciples have made this for you.” Prabhupada said, “I am a sannyasi; I can stay anywhere. You stay here.” That was Prabhupada’s generosity of spirit and his graciousness toward Mr. Sethi.</p>\n<p>Soon thereafter, Srila Prabhupada left this world, but Mr. Sethi continued his service. He arranged and paid for a beautiful, ornate pure silver arati set for offering guru-puja to Srila Prabhupada. And every year on Prabhupada’s appearance and disappearance days he would sponsor a grand, opulent feast for everyone who came to the temple. Later, he created sizable fixed deposits in the bank, the interest from which would pay for opulent feasts on Prabhupada’s appearance and disappearance days in perpetuity. And he contributed for the construction of two guest rooms, the rent from which would sponsor Srila Prabhupada’s annual appearance and disappearance festivals. </p>\n<p>Then, last year, Mr. Sethi became ill. He was eighty-eight, but he had no fear of death. He was completely detached from the body. Devotees constantly surrounded him with kirtana. His spiritual and biological families—everyone—was so attached to him. It is really powerful when the head of a family is such a staunch devotee. Sethiji’s wife is also a very good devotee. His sons and daughters and grandchildren—the whole, large family—is Krsna conscious. Their affection for him was exceptionally strong, with a familial relationship based on his being husband, father, and grandfather, and a spiritual relationship based on his bringing them to Srila Prabhupada and inspiring them in Krsna consciousness. </p>\n<p>Then, on February 12, he began to say, “Prabhupada is calling me. He is preparing a room for me, and when it is ready he will take me. I am going from where I came, back to my guruji.” On February 13, he insisted on going to the temple. And three days later, at 11 p.m., surrounded by devotees lovingly chanting the holy names of Krsna in kirtana, he left his body to rejoin Srila Prabhupada. He was so fixed in service and devotion to Srila Prabhupada that at the very end his mind was fixed on Srila Prabhupada.</p>\n<p>Once, Mr. Sethi told Srila Prabhupada that sometimes devotees would ask him why he didn’t get initiated. Prabhupada replied, “You are better than initiated. An initiated disciple can serve Krsna, worship the Deity, but you are serving the servants of Krsna, and that is higher.” And he quoted the verse,</p>\n<p>aradhananam sarvesam<br />\n visnor aradhanam param<br />\ntasmat parataram devi<br />\n tadiyanam samarcanam</p>\n<p>“Of all kinds of worship, the worship of Lord Visnu, or Krsna, is the topmost. But above even the worship of Lord Visnu is the rendering of service to Vaisnavas, who are related to Visnu.” (Padma Purana)</p>\n<p>And Prabhupada added, “Beside, I have much work for you. There may be things I want you to do that would be awkward for an initiated disciple, but as you are now, you can do them conveniently.” </p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada was very liberal. He knew the heart—the devotion, the service—of the person, and he accepted Mr. Sethi as more than an initiated disciple. And there is no doubt that Mr. Sethi’s attachment to Srila Prabhupada and Srila Prabhupada’s service and his fixed consciousness on Srila Prabhupada at the end have carried him to Srila Prabhupada again.</p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada ki jaya!<br />\nMr. Sethi ki jaya!</p>\n<p>Devotee: Can we draw an analogy between Mr. Sethi and George Harrison, between the relationship between Srila Prabhupada and Mr. Sethi and the relationship between Srila Prabhupada and George Harrison?</p>\n<p>Giriraj Swami: That’s a good point. When I was saying how Srila Prabhupada was very liberal and knew the heart of a person and wasn’t so concerned with initiation, I actually thought of George Harrison. At an early stage, George asked Prabhupada if he should shave his head and move into the temple, and Prabhupada replied, “No, you should remain as a Beatle and write songs about Krsna.” Prabhupada may have seen that George could do more to spread the Krsna consciousness movement as he was, as a Beatle, than he could as an initiated devotee.</p>\n<p>Here I recall two small incidents that involved Mr. Sethi and Srila Prabhupada in Chandigarh. Mr. Sethi was from Punjab and had a home in the capital, Chandigarh. He very much supported the devotees’ efforts to establish ISKCON in Chandigarh. He hosted them in his house, worked toward the acquisition of land, and contributed to the development of the project on the land. </p>\n<p>In 1976 Prabhupada’s disciples arranged a huge pandal program in Chandigarh, and many important people—ministers and government officers—participated. One of the big ministers on the stage with Prabhupada looked at his watch and told Prabhupada that he had to leave. Srila Prabhupada whispered to Mr. Sethi, “He’s drunk and wants to go home to sleep.” Mr. Sethi escorted the minister to his car, and on the way he actually smelled the alcohol on the minister’s breath. This was another incident that increased Mr. Sethi’s faith in Srila Prabhupada, that Prabhupada knew everything. </p>\n<p>Later, the chief minister came to meet Srila Prabhupada, and he requested a copy of the Bhagavad-gita As It Is. The chief minister was very respectful toward the Gita, and as Mr. Sethi described it, he left Prabhupada’s room carrying the Gita on his head. After he left, Prabhupada told Mr. Sethi, “Because he has given the highest respect to the Bhagavad-gita, he will be given the highest respect in India.” In time, that chief minister, Giani Zail Singh, became the seventh president of India. And Mr. Sethi attributed his rise to the position of the highest respect in India to Srila Prabhupada’s blessing.</p>\n<p>So, this is the story of one sincere, humble devotee’s service to Srila Prabhupada and Srila Prabhupada’s immense mercy and blessings upon him. And somehow or other, that same, immense mercy from Srila Prabhupada is available to all of us who are serving him and his mission even now. </p>\n<p>Hare Krsna.</p>\n<p>Devotee: How did your parents react when you became a devotee?</p>\n<p>Giriraj Swami: I was a university student in Boston when I met Srila Prabhupada and joined the temple. Just before I was due to graduate, Srila Prabhupada spoke at my university, and soon thereafter I accepted him as my spiritual master. About two months later my parents came for my graduation ceremony, and they were shocked to see what had become of me [laughter]. At that time my service in the temple was peeling potatoes and cutting vegetables in the kitchen. My father said, “I spent so much money on your education. You came this far to peel potatoes?” [laughter] To him, it was the same ABC. He couldn’t understand that there was a gulf of difference between this ABC and that ABC.</p>\n<p>So it was a shock, and they were quite concerned about me. Many little incidents took place. Then eventually I went to India. And in 1971 my parents came to meet me there—in Calcutta. In Boston my father had said, “If you leave this and come back, I will give you a million dollars,” which was really a lot of money then. Then they came to Calcutta and met Srila Prabhupada. </p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada was so expert. He told this brilliantly constructed story about his life in Allahabad when he had a pharmacy. Motilal Nehru—the father of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India—had been one of Prabhupada’s customers. Motilal Nehru, Prabhupada said, would come to his pharmacy and complain about his son, who according to his father was useless. So Motilal offered his son to the freedom movement.</p>\n<p>Prabhupada also mentioned how both the father and son had a prejudice in favor of England and against India. He said that if they could purchase the exact same medicine made in India and made in England, the Nehrus would get the one from England at ten times the cost. The medicine was the same, but the words “Made in England” made all the difference.</p>\n<p>The whole story was fascinating, but in a subtle way Srila Prabhupada was preaching to my father and attacking some of his natural prejudices and sentiments. People tend to think that if someone holds an important material position—like prime minister—he must be someone special. But indirectly Prabhupada was saying that Nehru was a useless fellow. “Don’t put your faith in him.” Most Europeans and Americas then (and perhaps even now) had a prejudice against India. They thought that they were better than Indians, that India was backward and that Europe and America were more advanced. Prabhupada also attacked that prejudice, to make my father more open to Krsna consciousness. </p>\n<p>After Srila Prabhupada finished his story and told the devotees in the room to leave, my father told Srila Prabhupada that he wanted me back. He said, “I want to establish a trust in my son’s name, and I want to put a million dollars in it.” Prabhupada said, “All right.” And then my father said, “But I want Glenn to come home to sign the papers.” Prabhupada said, “You can send the papers here and he will sign.” </p>\n<p>My parents tried different approaches. They had met a very wealthy, aristocratic gentleman who lived in a beautiful suburb, the best suburb of Calcutta. His name was C. L. Bajoria, and he was a good friend of mine. They spent half a day with him and were very happy to have met him. It was said he owned one quarter of Darjeeling. </p>\n<p>So, my parents said to Srila Prabhupada, “Mr. Bajoria is a devotee, but he lives at home. He has a regular life. Why can’t Glenn also be a devotee and live at home?” Prabhupada said, “Well, he is not exactly a devotee like my disciples, but he has been touched by Krsna consciousness.” My father objected, “But still, you can be Krsna conscious at home. So why can’t Glenn be Krsna conscious at home?” And Prabhupada replied, “It is a matter of association. Here he gets the association of devotees. If he goes back to Chicago, he won’t have such association.” </p>\n<p>My mother saw the direction that the conversation was going, so she started to cry. Earlier, my parents had brought up the subject of protein. They were concerned that I wouldn’t get enough protein in my diet, because in those days people thought if you didn’t eat meat you wouldn’t get enough protein. Srila Prabhupada had a container of sandesa on his table, and so he put some sandesa in my father’s hand and in my mother’s hand. He wanted to pacify them with the spiritual potency of prasada. Then he said, “These sweets are made of pure cheese. They are full of protein.” And then he said to me, “You must eat two dozen sandesa and rasagulla every day.” [laughter] </p>\n<p>He could see that especially my mother was very concerned about my health. So he said, “Let your son stay with me until April and then, when I come to the West, he can come with me.” We were in October. So I said, “Actually, this is a very good plan, because right now it is very cold in America, especially in Chicago. So I can stay with Prabhupada when it’s cold in America and then when it gets hot in India and is pleasant in America I can come with him.” I said, “Srila Prabhupada is very intelligent, so he plans his schedule to be in India when it’s pleasant in the winter and cold in America, and to be in America when it is pleasant in the summer and too hot in India.” And my father said, “Yes, he is very intelligent.” Then Prabhupada said, “Your son is intelligent, because he has understood my motive in planning my schedule.” My father insisted, “No, you are intelligent.” Then Prabhupada said, “Well, I guess I must be intelligent; otherwise how could I attract so many intelligent young women and men like your son?” </p>\n<p>So it was all settled: I would stay with Prabhupada and come with him to America in April. In the meantime, Prabhupada said, he would take personal care of me and make sure that I ate enough rasagulla and sandesa. And as we were leaving Prabhupada’s room, walking out onto the balcony, my father expressed his appreciation for Srila Prabhupada. He said, “I’ll say two things about your master. He is a brilliant organizer, and he really knows how to deal with people.” And in my father’s value system, those were very high compliments.</p>\n<p>I’ll tell one last little anecdote. In 1973 I actually did get sick, with jaundice, and Srila Prabhupada said that as long as I remained in Bombay I wouldn’t be able to recover. So I went to Los Angeles, and my parents and sister came to meet me there. One day my parents and I accompanied Srila Prabhupada on his morning walk. Prabhupada was so gracious and charming, not just to my parents but to everyone. Our scientist Svarupa Damodara was there, and some book distributors and managers, and Prabhupada just completely charmed and engaged everyone. When he saw my mother he said, “Oh, Mrs. Teton, you look so young.” And he consulted my father about some legal matters, because my father was a lawyer. </p>\n<p>Then at the end of the walk we came to the parking lot. The devotees had arranged a Rolls Royce for Srila Prabhupada, and my father was eyeing the Rolls Royce. Srila Prabhupada could see that, and in a very shy, humble way, said, “My disciples have arranged this for me.” My father immediately responded, “No, no, you deserve it. You deserve it.” [laughter] And then Prabhupada said to him, “You can ride with me. You come with me.” But my father declined, “No, we have our own rented car.”</p>\n<p>Then what I heard later is very significant. Prabhupada’s servant said to him, “Srila Prabhupada, everyone likes you so much.” And Prabhupada said, “Yes, because I like everyone.” And he really did.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your attention, your hospitality, your affection, and your wonderful service. You are in very good hands with His Holiness Niranjana Swami and His Grace Acyuta Priya Prabhu and the other leaders here, and the sannyasis and senior preachers who come to visit. So please continue to serve Srila Prabhupada and his representatives and chant nicely, dance nicely, and eat nicely. Be happy in Krsna consciousness, and help make others happy by bringing them to Krsna consciousness. Hare Krsna.</p>\n<p>Srila Prabhupada ki jaya!</p>\n",

				"value": "<p>A student was sent to the Boston temple on an assignment given to her by her professor at Emmanuel College. She wrote the following description of her experience at the temple to her professor and the professor shared her report with the Boston Temple President, Daru Krsna dasa. In turn, Daru Krsna dasa shared the report with me.</p>\r\n<p>It was very interesting for me to read her perception of each event she either witnessed or experienced; events which most devotees would normally not pay such close attention to, if any at all. It helped me to realize how important it is for devotees to be genuine in the presence of newcomers . We do not need to put on a show to make an unrealistic presentation of who we are. A sincere person will be attracted if we are simply genuine.</p>\r\n<p>Of course we should still be conscientious when there are newcomers present, and we should be empathetic towards their first-time exposure to Krsna consciousness, always trying our best to help them understand what they are being exposed to. It is a preacher's duty to preach according to time, place and circumstance, and when new people are present, the circumstance warrants a sensitivity to the fact that these people are observing us, probably in most cases, much in the same way as this student observed the evening program in the Boston temple. But still, we should not be afraid to be ourselves and to be genuine.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, just 15 minutes ago I finished a two-hour discussion with some senior devotees here in Budapest who were asking me all about my experiences as a college preacher back in the 80's. One of the main points I emphasized was that it was my experience as a college preacher that the interest for a personal rapport with the students and teachers in the dress of a devotee was probably more of an important element for attracting people to Krsna consciousness than the concern that the presentation  should be scholarly in order to attract them. I certainly do not mean to suggest that a scholarly presentation is not beneficial for attracting people's interest in Krsna consciousness. If it can be presented in a genuine way, by an experienced preacher whose heart is absorbed in ultimately giving Krsna consciousness to his audience, then the result will be the same. But to think that the scholarly presentation, in of itself, is more important, without a realized grasp of the subject matter's connection to Krsna consciousness, would be a misapplication of one's scholarly presentation.</p>\r\n<p>Even young Nimai Pandit used his scholarly talents to first attract so many followers to become His student. But obviously, He was always conscious of His purpose for attracting them with His scholarship. Once they were attracted and they became captivated by His personality, it was His personality, His example of devotion (in the role of a devotee) and His compassion which prompted them all to tie up their grammar books and to instead take up the chanting of the Lord's Holy Names.</p>\r\n<p>I could go on, but the purpose of this blog was to introduce the following description written by this student in Boston. So here it is:</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna [The next \"Hare Krishna\" was hers]</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krishna</p>\r\n<p>It was so cool!  We had planned (me and Chalice and Becky) to show up at 5 to hear the textual study before the service, but for some reason the T [Boston's transit system—NRS] was on the fritz.  We didn’t arrive at the temple (?) until about 6.  When we went in there was a place to put shoes on the left and Chalice took us upstairs to drop our coats and bags off.  Then we went into the temple room to catch the tail end of the textual study.</p>\r\n<p>The first thing I noticed was that when devotees enter the temple room, they kneel on the ground and press their faces to the floor.  I forgot to ask Chalice what this meant, but they all did it.  It reminded me of genuflection in Catholic churches.  Then I noticed that people had mixed clothing.  Some were wearing saris while others were wearing jeans like me.  There were children everywhere as well, also in mixed attire.  Some of the devotees had what looked to me like an arrow on the middle of their foreheads.  Others had dots made of what looked like red wax.  Chalice’s arrow faded during the dancing because it got so warm.</p>\r\n<p>When the textual study was over, a man walked around with papers.  They had lyrics for the chant/song we were about to sing.  During the chant/song the devotees, and me and Becky, went up to the front to where the icon(s) were.  While we were waiting, a woman came around with what looked like a gold four-pronged lamp.  Chalice said we were to put our hand over it and then place our hand on our foreheads.  Once up to the front, a woman dropped a little dollop of water into our hands for cleanliness and we shook our hands of over a towel on the floor.  Then we were given little lamps with ghee to hold up to Krishna.  Then we went back to the back of the room and the singing and dancing began.</p>\r\n<p>Chalice started a very simple step, so Becky and I followed.  It was a little difficult at first because the people who weren’t dancing were still standing in the middle of the floor and it was hard to move.  But when more people started to dance, the non-dancers moved to the sides of the room to watch and sing.  We learned a few different steps and did them in different orders.

				"safe_value": "<p>A student was sent to the Boston temple on an assignment given to her by her professor at Emmanuel College. She wrote the following description of her experience at the temple to her professor and the professor shared her report with the Boston Temple President, Daru Krsna dasa. In turn, Daru Krsna dasa shared the report with me.</p>\n<p>It was very interesting for me to read her perception of each event she either witnessed or experienced; events which most devotees would normally not pay such close attention to, if any at all. It helped me to realize how important it is for devotees to be genuine in the presence of newcomers . We do not need to put on a show to make an unrealistic presentation of who we are. A sincere person will be attracted if we are simply genuine.</p>\n<p>Of course we should still be conscientious when there are newcomers present, and we should be empathetic towards their first-time exposure to Krsna consciousness, always trying our best to help them understand what they are being exposed to. It is a preacher's duty to preach according to time, place and circumstance, and when new people are present, the circumstance warrants a sensitivity to the fact that these people are observing us, probably in most cases, much in the same way as this student observed the evening program in the Boston temple. But still, we should not be afraid to be ourselves and to be genuine.</p>\n<p>In fact, just 15 minutes ago I finished a two-hour discussion with some senior devotees here in Budapest who were asking me all about my experiences as a college preacher back in the 80's. One of the main points I emphasized was that it was my experience as a college preacher that the interest for a personal rapport with the students and teachers in the dress of a devotee was probably more of an important element for attracting people to Krsna consciousness than the concern that the presentation  should be scholarly in order to attract them. I certainly do not mean to suggest that a scholarly presentation is not beneficial for attracting people's interest in Krsna consciousness. If it can be presented in a genuine way, by an experienced preacher whose heart is absorbed in ultimately giving Krsna consciousness to his audience, then the result will be the same. But to think that the scholarly presentation, in of itself, is more important, without a realized grasp of the subject matter's connection to Krsna consciousness, would be a misapplication of one's scholarly presentation.</p>\n<p>Even young Nimai Pandit used his scholarly talents to first attract so many followers to become His student. But obviously, He was always conscious of His purpose for attracting them with His scholarship. Once they were attracted and they became captivated by His personality, it was His personality, His example of devotion (in the role of a devotee) and His compassion which prompted them all to tie up their grammar books and to instead take up the chanting of the Lord's Holy Names.</p>\n<p>I could go on, but the purpose of this blog was to introduce the following description written by this student in Boston. So here it is:</p>\n<p>Hare Krsna [The next \"Hare Krishna\" was hers]</p>\n<p>Hare Krishna</p>\n<p>It was so cool!  We had planned (me and Chalice and Becky) to show up at 5 to hear the textual study before the service, but for some reason the T [Boston's transit system—NRS] was on the fritz.  We didn’t arrive at the temple (?) until about 6.  When we went in there was a place to put shoes on the left and Chalice took us upstairs to drop our coats and bags off.  Then we went into the temple room to catch the tail end of the textual study.</p>\n<p>The first thing I noticed was that when devotees enter the temple room, they kneel on the ground and press their faces to the floor.  I forgot to ask Chalice what this meant, but they all did it.  It reminded me of genuflection in Catholic churches.  Then I noticed that people had mixed clothing.  Some were wearing saris while others were wearing jeans like me.  There were children everywhere as well, also in mixed attire.  Some of the devotees had what looked to me like an arrow on the middle of their foreheads.  Others had dots made of what looked like red wax.  Chalice’s arrow faded during the dancing because it got so warm.</p>\n<p>When the textual study was over, a man walked around with papers.  They had lyrics for the chant/song we were about to sing.  During the chant/song the devotees, and me and Becky, went up to the front to where the icon(s) were.  While we were waiting, a woman came around with what looked like a gold four-pronged lamp.  Chalice said we were to put our hand over it and then place our hand on our foreheads.  Once up to the front, a woman dropped a little dollop of water into our hands for cleanliness and we shook our hands of over a towel on the floor.  Then we were given little lamps with ghee to hold up to Krishna.  Then we went back to the back of the room and the singing and dancing began.</p>\n<p>Chalice started a very simple step, so Becky and I followed.  It was a little difficult at first because the people who weren’t dancing were still standing in the middle of the floor and it was hard to move.  But when more people started to dance, the non-dancers moved to the sides of the room to watch and sing.  We learned a few different steps and did them in different orders.  When we were dancing in a circle, the lady across from me grabbed my arm and spun with me in the middle of the circle.  I was surprised when she did that, but she kept smiling and showing me how to improve my dancing.  By the end of the service we were all sweaty and smiling. </p>\n<p>During the announcements after the dancing, a woman came around with a strongly smelling flower and rubbed it on our right hands.  I can still smell it even after I showered and put lotion on.  Something special that happened during that service was an older woman singing a pretty long song before people got up to eat.

				"value": "<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Courier\"><!--StartFragment--></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the past week I've narrated, more than once, an interesting recollection to devotees here in Budapest about a college preaching engagement I did in the early 1980's when I was Temple President in Boston. Since this, and other similar memories have been churning in my mind these past couple of days, I thought I would share this story here in my blog. For me, this experience has served as a thoughtful reminder that even in an apparent unfavorable situation, if we have faith and conviction about what we are doing, Krsna can reverse that situation into something favorable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the years 1979 – 1983, I was the Temple President of Boston. During the first year or two of my tenure, I was a bit more embroiled in management than I would have preferred, especially when I had to deal with the sale of the five-story building next to our temple building on Commonwealth Avenue, which happened to be one of the most up-and-coming and prestigious areas in all of the United States. On top of that, I also had to deal with the purchase and management of another property for householder residency 30 miles outside of the city, a 28-room, residential building on a large plot of land, and which was an annex to the Boston temple.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After these matters were settled and once I was more stably situated in my service, I began looking for outside preaching opportunities which would nicely complement my service as President. I did not want to be managing in the temple all day, and Boston was (and still is) a literal treasure house of preaching opportunities in the more than one hundred colleges and universities spread out through the entire metropolitan area of Boston. From September to May of each year, even back in those days, there were at least 250,000 college students in Boston at any given time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Srila Prabhupada personally preached in several of Boston's internationally renowned universities such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Brandeis University, and so many others. He also spoke about, and many times wrote about, including in letters to my former Temple President, Trai Prabhu, the importance of preaching in the colleges and universities in Boston. Here is one of many samples of Srila Prabhupada's interest in Boston's universities in a letter dated August 19, 1968, to Sacisuta dasa:<o:p> </o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The Boston center is also very important, because there are many students and Boston is educational center, especially there are so many universities so if you concentrate your energy and can organize the student community to understand our philosophy it will be a great service.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since our temple is located right in the heart of Boston, it was not uncommon to receive phone calls and letters from professors requesting if a speaker from the temple could come and give a presentation about Krsna consciousness to their students. This means that even without much extra effort, there were occasional classroom engagements, maybe one or even two a week, towards the end of each semester, which I could do. It was also even more common to receive an entire class of students, along with their teacher, who would come to the temple on a prearranged day, to hear an introductory talk on Krsna consciousness, to see the arati ceremony, and to sample a little prasadam.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, since I was looking for more outside preaching engagements and since the opportunity to lecture to students was becoming more of my focus, we decided to print up a brochure, listing several available speakers on various religious, philosophical, and social topics. We called ourselves the \"ISKCON Speakers Guild\", and we mailed out the brochures, with a cover letter, to the heads of the philosophy, sociology, religious, anthropology, and similar departments in many of the major universities throughout Boston, offering our services to lecture to their students on any one or more of these topics.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One day the temple received a phone call from a student at \"Boston State Teacher's College,\" who told us that she was making a presentation about us in her \"Health Education\" class and that her professor gave her permission to invite me to observe her presentation and to be there to answer questions about our philosophy and lifestyle. She gave me the time and place to meet her at the college and I agreed to come, telling her what she could expect from my presentation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Generally, whenever I would give a classroom presentation, I would bring at least one, but usually a few devotees with me. I would begin the presentation with a short explanation about chanting, we would have a short kirtan, and I would then give my introductory presentation about Krsna consciousness. We would always bring some prasadam to distribute to the students after the presentation. Usually the prasadam would be distributed by the devotees who accompanied me while I continued taking questions from the students after the presentation. So I explained all of this to this student and she seemed satisfied with what we could offer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the scheduled day of the engagement, my godbrother, Mukta Vandya dasa, and I prepared all of the paraphernalia and prasadam for our usual presentation, and we then proceeded to the college—not far from the temple— to meet the student in front of the building at the prearranged time. When we arrived, the student was there waiting and she told us that everyone was upstairs in the classroom, including her professor, and they were all waiting for us. We proceeded up the stairs to the classroom, expecting the usual-- a warm welcome, an introduction to the students of who we were and why we were there, and then a request by the professor to his/her students to listen attentively to our presentation since it was typically relevant to the course they were taking.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, upon entering the classroom, I was surprised to see that at the front of the class was a low platform, upon which stood a row of about four or five desks with four students sitting behind them. Something else which was a little unusual, was that the professor, although present at the back of the class when we walked in, never acknowledged our presence. Mukta Vandya Prabhu and I were escorted to the front row of the class where we were given seats and we were told that the students would be speaking first and then I could speak later. The student who met us then proceeded to sit behind one of the desks on the platform, the professor told them to begin, and then the first student began giving his presentation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Without even acknowledging our presence, the first student began by summarizing the theme of his talk— \"The Dangers of Cults\"— and then proceeded to give a detailed account from his research, including as much statistics as he could find, on the many different cults which were in existence in the United States at that time. After he spoke, each subsequent speaker from the five-member panel (among them, our host) covered a different aspect about the dangers of cults, including methods of recruitment, indoctrination, rituals, historical background of each cult, the typical behavior of a brainwashed member, and specifically why cults were so dangerous in mainstream America at that time. Needless to say, to sit and listen to all of this was a little bit intimidating. Mukta Vandya Prabhu and I would exchange glances from time to time, reading each others' mind, and wondering if we should tolerate all of this or just leave. But assuming that I was going to be given a chance to speak at the end of their presentation, I tolerated it until the end.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, I was introduced to the class, and I was told that the next phase of their presentation would be to allow the students to ask me questions related to the findings of the five-member panel. I was then invited to stand in front of the class to field questions from the students. Of course, by then I had fully realized that we had been tricked, that I was not invited to give a presentation, but rather I had been invited as a \"cult specimen\" to dissect in front of the classroom after hearing how dangerous I was both to society and to all of them. But I already knew what I was going to speak about, since I had plenty of time to mentally prepare my talk while the panel members were delivering their findings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Accepting the invitation, I immediately stood up and began speaking, \"Before we can take any questions on today's topic, first I must explain, according to the evidence I have from academic circles, what is the difference between a cult and a religion!\" No sooner had these words come out of my mouth, immediately the professor, who all of this time had been sitting in the back of the class, briskly stood up and protested, \"We have not invited you here for your presentation! You are here to answer the students' questions and nothing else. Now please take the first question.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I didn't listen to him. I continued speaking, trying as much as possible to reason to the intelligence of the students that they were being misled by not having been given any clear explanation, neither within the context of the previous presentation, nor within the context of their classroom studies (slightly alluding to the deviant tutelage of their professor), of what is the difference between a cult and a religion. The professor continued to object to my speaking. By this time he was raising his voice and was even turning a little bit red in the face, angered by my resistance to submit to his will. I simply continued my presentation. I specifically remember praying to Srila Prabhupada to give me the words to make these people hear his pure message.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By this time the professor seemed ready to have me physically removed from the front of the class, but all of a sudden one student sitting on the left side of the class, stood up, turned to the back of the classroom, pounded her hand on the desk, and loudly, but respectfully, said to her teacher, \"I object to the way you are treating this gentleman! Isn't there some way he can be allowed to continue to speak?\" I stopped and waited for his response. Nothing. Instead, however, another student stood up, faced the professor, and he also objected to the way I was being treated. Without saying another word, within the next 30 seconds, at least ten other students were out of their seats, some even raising their voices in protest, and again and again I was hearing, \"Let him speak! Let him speak! Let him speak!\" Mukta Vandya Prabhu's eyes caught mine, we smiled at each other, and we realized that these students were going to take control of the situation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unexpectedly, the professor relented. He was clearly outnumbered. Of course, he was the professor and he could have easily used his position to quell the student's uprising. But I sensed that he realized that by doing so he could become extremely unpopular in the eyes of his students, and it was still very early in the semester, meaning that he would be seeing and dealing with these same students for many more weeks before they would move on to another course. Of course, that could have been an external reason, but there must have been internal reasons as well. Somehow, for whatever reason, Krsna who was in the hearts of these students and who is even willing to sit in the heart of this professor, was arranging for His pure devotee to be glorified. I took the professor's restrained silence as the opportunity to continue my talk and gradually I began speaking about Srila Prabhupada and the qualifications of a bona fide saintly person and teacher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I spoke for about thirty minutes and sensed that I had the full attention of practically the whole class (minus the professor, of course). By the end of my talk, the class session was practically over. Although there was no formal time for many questions and answers, as soon as the students were told that the class was over, the majority of the students clamored to the front of the room, asking for books, brochures, and whatever we had that they could take with them. Within minutes the two boxes of books we brought with us were empty, all the prasadam was distributed, and Mukta Vandya Prabhu and I had been besieged with questions by the inquisitive students, wanting to learn more about our philosophy. Even our host, the student who invited us to the class, came up to apologize for the behavior of their professor (who had immediately left). She even informed us that the professor from the other \"Health Education\" course across the hall from where we had just spoke heard part of the presentation and he was asking if I would come the next day to speak on the same subject. I asked her if there was going to be another panel discussion but this time I was assured that the whole presentation time would be mine.<o:p> </o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We thanked the students for their interest, and left them with all of the literature we had brought along with us. The following day, Mukta Vandya Prabhu and I made our usual preparations for a classroom preaching presentation. We brought kartals, mrdanga, books, and prasadam, but this time, we were greeted at the door, respectfully introduced by the professor, and we had a fully captive audience from start to finish, even during the kirtan during which most of students chanted along with us.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Seems like they realized we were not so dangerous after all. We finished by saying that chanting Hare Krsna is real \"Health Education\" and good for their health too.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hare Krsna</p>\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n<p> </p>",

Since this, and other similar memories have been churning in my mind these past couple of days, I thought I would share this story here in my blog. For me, this experience has served as a thoughtful reminder that even in an apparent unfavorable situation, if we have faith and conviction about what we are doing, Krsna can reverse that situation into something favorable.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the years 1979 – 1983, I was the Temple President of Boston. During the first year or two of my tenure, I was a bit more embroiled in management than I would have preferred, especially when I had to deal with the sale of the five-story building next to our temple building on Commonwealth Avenue, which happened to be one of the most up-and-coming and prestigious areas in all of the United States. On top of that, I also had to deal with the purchase and management of another property for householder residency 30 miles outside of the city, a 28-room, residential building on a large plot of land, and which was an annex to the Boston temple.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After these matters were settled and once I was more stably situated in my service, I began looking for outside preaching opportunities which would nicely complement my service as President. I did not want to be managing in the temple all day, and Boston was (and still is) a literal treasure house of preaching opportunities in the more than one hundred colleges and universities spread out through the entire metropolitan area of Boston. From September to May of each year, even back in those days, there were at least 250,000 college students in Boston at any given time.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Srila Prabhupada personally preached in several of Boston's internationally renowned universities such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Brandeis University, and so many others. He also spoke about, and many times wrote about, including in letters to my former Temple President, Trai Prabhu, the importance of preaching in the colleges and universities in Boston. Here is one of many samples of Srila Prabhupada's interest in Boston's universities in a letter dated August 19, 1968, to Sacisuta dasa:<p></p></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The Boston center is also very important, because there are many students and Boston is educational center, especially there are so many universities so if you concentrate your energy and can organize the student community to understand our philosophy it will be a great service.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since our temple is located right in the heart of Boston, it was not uncommon to receive phone calls and letters from professors requesting if a speaker from the temple could come and give a presentation about Krsna consciousness to their students. This means that even without much extra effort, there were occasional classroom engagements, maybe one or even two a week, towards the end of each semester, which I could do. It was also even more common to receive an entire class of students, along with their teacher, who would come to the temple on a prearranged day, to hear an introductory talk on Krsna consciousness, to see the arati ceremony, and to sample a little prasadam.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, since I was looking for more outside preaching engagements and since the opportunity to lecture to students was becoming more of my focus, we decided to print up a brochure, listing several available speakers on various religious, philosophical, and social topics. We called ourselves the \"ISKCON Speakers Guild\", and we mailed out the brochures, with a cover letter, to the heads of the philosophy, sociology, religious, anthropology, and similar departments in many of the major universities throughout Boston, offering our services to lecture to their students on any one or more of these topics.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One day the temple received a phone call from a student at \"Boston State Teacher's College,\" who told us that she was making a presentation about us in her \"Health Education\" class and that her professor gave her permission to invite me to observe her presentation and to be there to answer questions about our philosophy and lifestyle. She gave me the time and place to meet her at the college and I agreed to come, telling her what she could expect from my presentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Generally, whenever I would give a classroom presentation, I would bring at least one, but usually a few devotees with me. I would begin the presentation with a short explanation about chanting, we would have a short kirtan, and I would then give my introductory presentation about Krsna consciousness. We would always bring some prasadam to distribute to the students after the presentation. Usually the prasadam would be distributed by the devotees who accompanied me while I continued taking questions from the students after the presentation. So I explained all of this to this student and she seemed satisfied with what we could offer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the scheduled day of the engagement, my godbrother, Mukta Vandya dasa, and I prepared all of the paraphernalia and prasadam for our usual presentation, and we then proceeded to the college—not far from the temple— to meet the student in front of the building at the prearranged time. When we arrived, the student was there waiting and she told us that everyone was upstairs in the classroom, including her professor, and they were all waiting for us. We proceeded up the stairs to the classroom, expecting the usual-- a warm welcome, an introduction to the students of who we were and why we were there, and then a request by the professor to his/her students to listen attentively to our presentation since it was typically relevant to the course they were taking.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, upon entering the classroom, I was surprised to see that at the front of the class was a low platform, upon which stood a row of about four or five desks with four students sitting behind them. Something else which was a little unusual, was that the professor, although present at the back of the class when we walked in, never acknowledged our presence. Mukta Vandya Prabhu and I were escorted to the front row of the class where we were given seats and we were told that the students would be speaking first and then I could speak later. The student who met us then proceeded to sit behind one of the desks on the platform, the professor told them to begin, and then the first student began giving his presentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Without even acknowledging our presence, the first student began by summarizing the theme of his talk— \"The Dangers of Cults\"— and then proceeded to give a detailed account from his research, including as much statistics as he could find, on the many different cults which were in existence in the United States at that time. After he spoke, each subsequent speaker from the five-member panel (among them, our host) covered a different aspect about the dangers of cults, including methods of recruitment, indoctrination, rituals, historical background of each cult, the typical behavior of a brainwashed member, and specifically why cults were so dangerous in mainstream America at that time. Needless to say, to sit and listen to all of this was a little bit intimidating. Mukta Vandya Prabhu and I would exchange glances from time to time, reading each others' mind, and wondering if we should tolerate all of this or just leave. But assuming that I was going to be given a chance to speak at the end of their presentation, I tolerated it until the end.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, I was introduced to the class, and I was told that the next phase of their presentation would be to allow the students to ask me questions related to the findings of the five-member panel. I was then invited to stand in front of the class to field questions from the students. Of course, by then I had fully realized that we had been tricked, that I was not invited to give a presentation, but rather I had been invited as a \"cult specimen\" to dissect in front of the classroom after hearing how dangerous I was both to society and to all of them. But I already knew what I was going to speak about, since I had plenty of time to mentally prepare my talk while the panel members were delivering their findings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Accepting the invitation, I immediately stood up and began speaking, \"Before we can take any questions on today's topic, first I must explain, according to the evidence I have from academic circles, what is the difference between a cult and a religion!\" No sooner had these words come out of my mouth, immediately the professor, who all of this time had been sitting in the back of the class, briskly stood up and protested, \"We have not invited you here for your presentation! You are here to answer the students' questions and nothing else. Now please take the first question.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I didn't listen to him. I continued speaking, trying as much as possible to reason to the intelligence of the students that they were being misled by not having been given any clear explanation, neither within the context of the previous presentation, nor within the context of their classroom studies (slightly alluding to the deviant tutelage of their professor), of what is the difference between a cult and a religion. The professor continued to object to my speaking. By this time he was raising his voice and was even turning a little bit red in the face, angered by my resistance to submit to his will. I simply continued my presentation. I specifically remember praying to Srila Prabhupada to give me the words to make these people hear his pure message.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By this time the professor seemed ready to have me physically removed from the front of the class, but all of a sudden one student sitting on the left side of the class, stood up, turned to the back of the classroom, pounded her hand on the desk, and loudly, but respectfully, said to her teacher, \"I object to the way you are treating this gentleman! Isn't there some way he can be allowed to continue to speak?\" I stopped and waited for his response. Nothing. Instead, however, another student stood up, faced the professor, and he also objected to the way I was being treated. Without saying another word, within the next 30 seconds, at least ten other students were out of their seats, some even raising their voices in protest, and again and again I was hearing, \"Let him speak! Let him speak! Let him speak!\" Mukta Vandya Prabhu's eyes caught mine, we smiled at each other, and we realized that these students were going to take control of the situation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unexpectedly, the professor relented. He was clearly outnumbered. Of course, he was the professor and he could have easily used his position to quell the student's uprising. But I sensed that he realized that by doing so he could become extremely unpopular in the eyes of his students, and it was still very early in the semester, meaning that he would be seeing and dealing with these same students for many more weeks before they would move on to another course. Of course, that could have been an external reason, but there must have been internal reasons as well. Somehow, for whatever reason, Krsna who was in the hearts of these students and who is even willing to sit in the heart of this professor, was arranging for His pure devotee to be glorified. I took the professor's restrained silence as the opportunity to continue my talk and gradually I began speaking about Srila Prabhupada and the qualifications of a bona fide saintly person and teacher.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I spoke for about thirty minutes and sensed that I had the full attention of practically the whole class (minus the professor, of course). By the end of my talk, the class session was practically over. Although there was no formal time for many questions and answers, as soon as the students were told that the class was over, the majority of the students clamored to the front of the room, asking for books, brochures, and whatever we had that they could take with them.

All comments in the articles are those of the authors and not mine.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h4>Article #1</h4>\r\n<h4>350 million people are suffering from Facebook Addiction Disorder [FAD]<br />\r\nPosted on January 28, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"332\" alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/webfm/Fileshare/Miscellaneous/facebook_addiction_disorder_fad.jpg\"><br />\r\n </h4>\r\n<p>Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD) is a term introduced by US phychologists for those who are addicted to facebook and their life is really effected by their uncontrolled activities on Facebook. According to US psychologists the number of patients suffering from FAD are increasing.</p>\r\n<p>Not only US but also millions of South Africans may also be at risk as they search for long-lost friends and relatives, share photo albums and stay abreast of gossip.</p>\r\n<p>Lynlee Howard-Payne, a psychology lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand, said: “While there are no official statistics available regarding South Africans who have been diagnosed as having or being treated for FAD, based on the large number of universities, schools and companies blocking access to Facebook … there could very well be an uncontrolled dependence.”</p>\r\n<p>Howard-Payne added: “Universities, schools and companies are forced to limit accessibility to Facebook because some people seem to be unable to perform other tasks if they have access to this online social network. While Facebook is often a great way of maintaining both social and professional relationships, it seems to take on a destructive force with certain personalities.”</p>\r\n<p>After US psychologists began their probe into FAD, millions of Facebook users – there are an estimated 350 million around the world – have admitted to being addicted.</p>\r\n<p>More than 500 groups for addicts have been created on Facebook, where members joke about their dependence on the site.</p>\r\n<p>Howard-Payne said if addicts chose to join a support group, it should not be on Facebook.</p>\r\n<p>She said: “Addictive use of the Internet is a new phenomenon which many practitioners are unaware of and, subsequently, unprepared to treat. Use of Facebook is often a legitimate way of social networking, so abstinence may not be seen as a practical intervention thus it is recommended that there be moderation and controlled use.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h4>Article #2</h4>\r\n<h4>Online Community Strategist</h4>\r\n<h4>Are your most active members suffering from depression?<br />\r\n(Febrary 2, 2010)</h4>\r\n<p>Have you ever wondered how some members of your online community (or any community for that matter) can get so overwhelmingly caught up in online drama with people they hardly know?  I know I have. Well, there could be a real, clinical reason behind it, according to a new study, that goes beyond them needing to “get a life.”</p>\r\n<p>Psychologists from Leeds University say they’ve found “striking” evidence that some avid internet users develop compulsive  habits in which they replace real-life social interaction with online chat rooms and social networking sites.</p>\r\n<p>The lead author of the study wrote in the the journal of Psychopathology that the study “reinforces the public speculation that over-engaging in websites that serve to replace normal social function might be linked to psychological disorders like depression and addiction.”</p>\r\n<p>WOW, THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.</p>\r\n<p>What the study didn’t glean is which comes first: excessive internet use or depression. In other words… are depressed people drawn to the internet or does the internet cause depression?”</p>\r\n<p>Here is one more interesting quote I just have to share:</p>\r\n<p>“While many of us use the internet to pay bills, shop and send emails, there is a small subset of the population who find it hard to control how much time they spend online, to the point where it interferes with their daily activities.”</p>\r\n<p>This is a really interesting study. Read more about it here in Science Daily, and come back and tell me what you think.Oh, you can also read the complete abstract with methodology and other pertinent information at Psychopathology.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h4>Article #3</h4>\r\n<h4>Science Daily (Feb. 4, 2010)</h4>\r\n<p>People who spend a lot of time browsing the Internet are more likely to show depressive symptoms, according to the first large-scale study of its kind in the West by University of Leeds psychologists.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers found striking evidence that some users have developed a compulsive internet habit, whereby they replace real-life social interaction with online chat rooms and social networking sites. The results suggest that this type of addictive surfing can have a serious impact on mental health.</p>\r\n<p>Lead author Dr Catriona Morrison, from the University of Leeds, said: \"The internet now plays a huge part in modern life, but its benefits are accompanied by a darker side.</p>\r\n<p>\"While many of us use the internet to pay bills, shop and send emails, there is a small subset of the population who find it hard to control how much time they spend online, to the point where it interferes with their daily activities.\" </p>\r\n<p>These 'internet addicts' spent proportionately more time browsing sexually gratifying websites, online gaming sites and online communities. They also had a higher incidence of moderate to severe depression than non-addicted users.</p>\r\n<p>\"Our research indicates that excessive internet use is associated with depression, but what we don't know is which comes first -- are depressed people drawn to the internet or does the internet cause depression?</p>\r\n<p>\"What is clear, is that for a small subset of people, excessive use of the internet could be a warning signal for depressive tendencies.\"</p>\r\n<p>Incidents such as the spate of suicides among teenagers in the Welsh town of Bridgend in 2008 led many to question the extent to which social networking sites can contribute to depressive thoughts in vulnerable teenagers.

				"safe_value": "<p>Here are three short articles I recently found which lend support to my previous post about \"Email vs Letter Writing.\" Of course, email is not quite the same as \"Social Networking.\" But there are many similarities which can bind one into a network of emailing much the same way as \"Social Networking\" does. </p>\n<p>Everything below are the articles as they were posted. All comments in the articles are those of the authors and not mine.</p>\n\n<h4>Article #1</h4>\n<h4>350 million people are suffering from Facebook Addiction Disorder [FAD]<br />\nPosted on January 28, 2010\n</h4><p><img width=\"500\" height=\"332\" alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/webfm/Fileshare/Miscellaneous/facebook_addiction_disorder_fad.jpg\" /><br /></p><p>Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD) is a term introduced by US phychologists for those who are addicted to facebook and their life is really effected by their uncontrolled activities on Facebook. According to US psychologists the number of patients suffering from FAD are increasing.</p>\n<p>Not only US but also millions of South Africans may also be at risk as they search for long-lost friends and relatives, share photo albums and stay abreast of gossip.</p>\n<p>Lynlee Howard-Payne, a psychology lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand, said: “While there are no official statistics available regarding South Africans who have been diagnosed as having or being treated for FAD, based on the large number of universities, schools and companies blocking access to Facebook … there could very well be an uncontrolled dependence.”</p>\n<p>Howard-Payne added: “Universities, schools and companies are forced to limit accessibility to Facebook because some people seem to be unable to perform other tasks if they have access to this online social network. While Facebook is often a great way of maintaining both social and professional relationships, it seems to take on a destructive force with certain personalities.”</p>\n<p>After US psychologists began their probe into FAD, millions of Facebook users – there are an estimated 350 million around the world – have admitted to being addicted.</p>\n<p>More than 500 groups for addicts have been created on Facebook, where members joke about their dependence on the site.</p>\n<p>Howard-Payne said if addicts chose to join a support group, it should not be on Facebook.</p>\n<p>She said: “Addictive use of the Internet is a new phenomenon which many practitioners are unaware of and, subsequently, unprepared to treat. Use of Facebook is often a legitimate way of social networking, so abstinence may not be seen as a practical intervention thus it is recommended that there be moderation and controlled use.”</p>\n\n<h4>Article #2</h4>\n<h4>Online Community Strategist</h4>\n<h4>Are your most active members suffering from depression?<br />\n(Febrary 2, 2010)</h4>\n<p>Have you ever wondered how some members of your online community (or any community for that matter) can get so overwhelmingly caught up in online drama with people they hardly know?  I know I have. Well, there could be a real, clinical reason behind it, according to a new study, that goes beyond them needing to “get a life.”</p>\n<p>Psychologists from Leeds University say they’ve found “striking” evidence that some avid internet users develop compulsive  habits in which they replace real-life social interaction with online chat rooms and social networking sites.</p>\n<p>The lead author of the study wrote in the the journal of Psychopathology that the study “reinforces the public speculation that over-engaging in websites that serve to replace normal social function might be linked to psychological disorders like depression and addiction.”</p>\n<p>WOW, THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.</p>\n<p>What the study didn’t glean is which comes first: excessive internet use or depression. In other words… are depressed people drawn to the internet or does the internet cause depression?”</p>\n<p>Here is one more interesting quote I just have to share:</p>\n<p>“While many of us use the internet to pay bills, shop and send emails, there is a small subset of the population who find it hard to control how much time they spend online, to the point where it interferes with their daily activities.”</p>\n<p>This is a really interesting study. Read more about it here in Science Daily, and come back and tell me what you think.Oh, you can also read the complete abstract with methodology and other pertinent information at Psychopathology.</p>\n\n<h4>Article #3</h4>\n<h4>Science Daily (Feb. 4, 2010)</h4>\n<p>People who spend a lot of time browsing the Internet are more likely to show depressive symptoms, according to the first large-scale study of its kind in the West by University of Leeds psychologists.</p>\n<p>Researchers found striking evidence that some users have developed a compulsive internet habit, whereby they replace real-life social interaction with online chat rooms and social networking sites. The results suggest that this type of addictive surfing can have a serious impact on mental health.</p>\n<p>Lead author Dr Catriona Morrison, from the University of Leeds, said: \"The internet now plays a huge part in modern life, but its benefits are accompanied by a darker side.</p>\n<p>\"While many of us use the internet to pay bills, shop and send emails, there is a small subset of the population who find it hard to control how much time they spend online, to the point where it interferes with their daily activities.\" </p>\n<p>These 'internet addicts' spent proportionately more time browsing sexually gratifying websites, online gaming sites and online communities. They also had a higher incidence of moderate to severe depression than non-addicted users.</p>\n<p>\"Our research indicates that excessive internet use is associated with depression, but what we don't know is which comes first -- are depressed people drawn to the internet or does the internet cause depression?</p>\n<p>\"What is clear, is that for a small subset of people, excessive use of the internet could be a warning signal for depressive tendencies.\"</p>\n<p>Incidents such as the spate of suicides among teenagers in the Welsh town of Bridgend in 2008 led many to question the extent to which social networking sites can contribute to depressive thoughts in vulnerable teenagers. In the Leeds study, young people were more likely to be internet addicted than middle-aged users, with the average age of the addicted group standing at 21 years.</p>\n<p>\"This study reinforces the public speculation that over-engaging in websites that serve to replace normal social function might be linked to psychological disorders like depression and addiction,\" added Dr Morrison. \"We now need to consider the wider societal implications of this relationship and establish clearly the effects of excessive internet use on mental health.\"</p>\n<p>This was the first large-scale study of Western young people to consider the relationship between internet addiction and depression. The internet use and depression levels of 1,319 people aged 16-51 were evaluated for the study, and of these, 1.2% were classed as being internet addicted. While small, this is larger than the incidence of gambling in the UK, which stands at 0.6%. The research will be published in the journal Psychopathology on 10th February.</p>\n",

There was a time, though it was probably somewhere between 40-50 years ago, when I would sit down with a pen and paper, write a letter, then rewrite the letter without the crossed-out words, fold the letter into an envelope, write the address and return address on the envelope, put a stamp on the envelope, and then finally take it to the closest mailbox to deposit it for the postman.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, ironically, about a month ago I was speaking with my mother.

				"value": "<p>Somebody just sent me the links to the following five videos:</p>\r\n<p>These videos were taken on Radhastami, 1998, in the kitchen of a rented hall in St. Petersburg. There are five short video clips which will play one after the other.</p>\r\n<p>I have very fond memories of this Radhastami. Although the circumstances under which we were forced to cook in this kitchen were not pleasant, nonetheless in the association of these wonderful devotees, somehow we managed to cook a feast for over 300 devotees in a small kitchen with a few electric stove burners.</p>\r\n<p>The main organizer of the feast was His Holiness B.B. Govinda Maharaja. He calculated all the ingredients required, made up the shopping list, organized the kitchen, and made most of the preparations himself. I can't remember how many preparations were prepared in that little kitchen, but I do remember that every one of the preparations tasted like they had been prepared by Srimati Radharani Herself, Krsna had then eaten all of them to His full satisfaction, and the remnants were somehow, by some inconceivable mercy, left for all of the assembled Vaisnavas to honor to their full satisfaction.</p>\r\n<p>I remember that His Holiness Radhanath Maharaja took full responsibility for organizing the preparation of the samosas. He made the samosa filling himself, he also made the dough, and he showed everyone how to roll out the dough, fill the samosas, and how to properly twist and press the edges so that they would not open up while they were cooking in the ghee. He told us stories how he used to make samosas in the early days of New Vrndavana.</p>\r\n<p>As the samosas were being filled, I specifically remember that Radhanath Maharaja was standing by the stove waiting and waiting for the ghee to get hot enough so that he could begin deep-frying the samosas. It was a very primitive electric stove and the pot full of ghee was so huge we all began to think that the ghee would never get hot enough to prepare the samosas. Every once in awhile Radhanath Maharaja would drop a little piece of dough into the ghee to see if it would cook. But every time he tried, the dough would just drop down to the bottom of the pot.</p>\r\n<p>After waiting a long time, all four of us, Govinda Maharaja, Radhanath Maharaja, Bhakti Vijnana Goswami Maharaja [then Vaidyanath dasa] and myself, stood around the pot with our arms around each other and began loudly chanting \"tapta-kancana-gaurangi, radhe vrndavanesvari/ vrsabhanu-sute devi, pranamami hari-priye,\" over and over again. We desperately wanted to offer samosas for Radharani's pleasure and knew of no other way to do so other than to pray for Her mercy to allow us to prepare them for Her pleasure. Within minutes after completing our prayers, Radhanath Maharaja again dropped a piece of dough into the ghee. It stayed on the surface and quickly became cooked. He then tried a full samosa. As we all stood around the pot and watched the samosa drop deep down into the ghee, we held our breaths. We then watched it slowly rise to the surface, and then gradually turn brown while Radhanath Maharaja carefully nursed it turning it over and over. Finally it was cooked!</p>\r\n<p>But there were hundreds of samosas to cook! Maharaja decided to throw a full batch of samosas into the ghee, and as we all looked on in amazement, every single one of the samosas gradually rose to the surface and gradually became cooked. It was a miracle which astonished everyone present. It was inconceivable how such a huge pot of ghee could become hot enough to cook all of those samosas on such an inadequate burner. But from that moment on, every samosa got cooked.</p>\r\n<p>I also remember cooking a very large pot of halavah—probably the largest pot of halavah I ever cooked. I used to regularly cook halavah for the Sunday Feasts in Boston back in the early 1970's, so that was one preparation I felt confident enough to make. But when it came time to melt down the butter so that the grains could be cooked, I was shocked to see how many kilos of butter Govinda Maharaja threw into the pot for me to cook all the grains in. It was probably almost twice the amount of butter that I was accustomed to using. Still, he was the master chef and I was simply there to assist him. Following his request I stood and cooked the grains for a very long time, carefully stirring them so that not a single grain would get burned. But there was so much butter in there that the grains almost seemed like they were all effortlessly swimming around in the butter themselves without me having to worry too much about them. Meanwhile, I prepared another huge pot of water with sugar along with the other ingredients to be cooked within the halavah. After quite some time, the grains were added to the boiling water, and after a lot of stirring, and a little help from Govinda Maharaja, every grain looked perfect. I honestly think it was the best halavah I ever made in my life.</p>\r\n<p>For some reason I cannot remember what preparation Bhakti Vijnana Goswami cooked, but I do remember that he was there in the kitchen cooking along with us the whole time. </p>\r\n<p>After Radhanath Maharaja, Bhakti Vijnana Maharaja and I finished our assignments, Govinda Maharaja suggested that we go up to the hall and start a kirtan while he worked on the finishing touches of the feast. We had a wonderful kirtan, Govinda Maharaja then appeared and then we all gave talks on Srimati Radharani. To be honest, I was a little reluctant to speak about Radharani in presence of such exalted Vaisnavas. But neither Radhanath Maharaja nor Govinda Maharaja were going to allow me to not speak. So I also gave a talk after they both spoke. We then had an arati, kirtan and then we all sat down for the most amazing feast I ever tasted.</p>\r\n<p>Radharani ki jaya!

There are five short video clips which will play one after the other.</p>\n<p>I have very fond memories of this Radhastami. Although the circumstances under which we were forced to cook in this kitchen were not pleasant, nonetheless in the association of these wonderful devotees, somehow we managed to cook a feast for over 300 devotees in a small kitchen with a few electric stove burners.</p>\n<p>The main organizer of the feast was His Holiness B.B. Govinda Maharaja. He calculated all the ingredients required, made up the shopping list, organized the kitchen, and made most of the preparations himself. I can't remember how many preparations were prepared in that little kitchen, but I do remember that every one of the preparations tasted like they had been prepared by Srimati Radharani Herself, Krsna had then eaten all of them to His full satisfaction, and the remnants were somehow, by some inconceivable mercy, left for all of the assembled Vaisnavas to honor to their full satisfaction.</p>\n<p>I remember that His Holiness Radhanath Maharaja took full responsibility for organizing the preparation of the samosas. He made the samosa filling himself, he also made the dough, and he showed everyone how to roll out the dough, fill the samosas, and how to properly twist and press the edges so that they would not open up while they were cooking in the ghee. He told us stories how he used to make samosas in the early days of New Vrndavana.</p>\n<p>As the samosas were being filled, I specifically remember that Radhanath Maharaja was standing by the stove waiting and waiting for the ghee to get hot enough so that he could begin deep-frying the samosas. It was a very primitive electric stove and the pot full of ghee was so huge we all began to think that the ghee would never get hot enough to prepare the samosas. Every once in awhile Radhanath Maharaja would drop a little piece of dough into the ghee to see if it would cook. But every time he tried, the dough would just drop down to the bottom of the pot.</p>\n<p>After waiting a long time, all four of us, Govinda Maharaja, Radhanath Maharaja, Bhakti Vijnana Goswami Maharaja [then Vaidyanath dasa] and myself, stood around the pot with our arms around each other and began loudly chanting \"tapta-kancana-gaurangi, radhe vrndavanesvari/ vrsabhanu-sute devi, pranamami hari-priye,\" over and over again.

And if you all of a sudden want to become master, then you go to hell. That's all. Don't do that. This is the teaching of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. If you go through the servant, servant, servant, then you are advanced. And if you think that you have now become master, then you are going to hell. This is the process. Dasa-dasanudasah. Caitanya Mahaprabhu said. So servant, servant, servant, a hundred times servant now, that means he is advanced. He is advanced.

The highest satisfaction is obtained when we are fixed in this mood of being a servant of the servant. But the illusory energy is so strong, that as soon as somebody offers us service, we foolishly think that we have become master. Srila Prabhupada can't make the point any clearer than he's made it here. \"If you think that you have now become master, then you are going to hell.\"</p>\r\n<p>In this connection, another important point from the same lecture:</p>\r\n<p>\"Don't adulterate – 'I think,' 'In my opinion.' These nonsense things should be given up. We should always be aware that we are insignificant creature. Our opinion and thinking has no value. This should be the first principle. Why should you give opinion on the words of Krsna? Are you more authoritative person than Krsna? This is foolishness, to try to become more than Krsna. There are so many rascals. They present that \"Now we have advanced. We know more than Krsna.\" So be saved from these rascals. Then you will understand Krsna, and through Caitanya Mahaprabhu you will understand what is the position of Krsna, what is your relationship with Krsna, what is the ultimate goal of life.

Grahila Prabhu's condition was much worse than the day before.

At the end when Maharaja was speaking about Madhumangala, Grahila Prabhu was laughing a lot. Maharaja requested for Grahila Prabhu to call him any time if Grahila Prabhu would start to feel worse.</p>\r\n<p>After Maharaja left we continued the kirtan. I asked Grahila Prabhu what he would prefer to listen to, Srila Prabhupada's recordings or kirtan.</p>\r\n<p>He smiled and said that it is difficult for him to choose because he likes both. So we continued our kirtan. </p>\r\n<p>Guru Seva went to take some rest, but I was concerned that she will not be able to get  any sleep because of the kirtan in the apartment. She said that she is absolutely happy when kirtan is going on and will not have any problems to take proper rest.</p>\r\n<p>Grahila Prabhu could not sleep for the last few days.

I could see that he was trying to absorb his mind on chanting.</p>\r\n<p>Around 1.30 AM, when other devotees came to replace those who were chanting, I went into Grahila Prabhu's room and noticed that he was breathing more often. He told me that he cannot control his breathing and cannot relax. Also he told me that he was feeling that Srila Prabhupada would come very soon. I went and woke up Guru Seva and at the same time we called Bhakti Brhat Bhagavata Maharaj.</p>\r\n<p>It was obvious that Grahila Prabhu was going to be departing soon. Sometimes he would feel a lot of heat inside the body and sometimes he was feeling cold. Also he started to feel more pain. But despite this, he was keeping his mind concentrated on kirtan and he was trying to chant. At one moment he requested Guru Seva to come closer and he started to give her instructions in spiritual life. I did not hear everything but two things were clearly said by him. He said that she should continue the process (devotional service) and chanting.</p>\r\n<p>At 3 AM, Bhakti Brhat Bhagavata Maharaja came and started to arrange everything in a very nice and expert way, preparing the whole atmosphere for Grahila Prabhu's departure. He requested all the devotees to go into Grahila Prabhu's room and then started to chant very softly and slowly (without harmonium and mridanga, only karatals) so that Grahila Prabhu could follow. It was an amazing kirtan. The melody was very simple but I could feel that this melody easily invoked in my mind memories of different places in Mayapura and Vrindavana.</p>\r\n<p>After some time he requested Trivikrama to lead the kirtan and he moved closer to Grahila Prabhu and took his hand. He started to talk to him directing his consciousness on remembrance about Srila Prabhupada, Gauranga Mahaprabhu and Radha-Madhava. Although Grahila Prabhu practically could not talk, suddenly he started loudly chanting together with us, sometimes folding his hands in pranam and sometimes raising them up. Maharaj asked Grahila Prabhu few times if he is ready to go and his answer was, \"Yes\".</p>\r\n<p>It was the most amazing thing.

When I told him that now was the time to think only about the future, and the future opportunities for service which Grahila Prabhu would be given as a result of Srila Prabhupada's blessings, it immediately became clear to me that he was already completely fixed in that mindset.

The following is part of a response I recently sent to a devotee who mentioned this fear to me:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>\"I can understand why you have concerns about being rejected. In mundane society, to reject an associate or friend for their failure to live up to their own expectations is very common among co-workers, friends, politicians, partners, and even family members. Accepting and rejecting is the business of a mind driven by personal ambition and that means that accepting and rejecting relationships is no exception for one who possesses such a mentality.</p>\r\n<p>But generally, devotees, even those who are not yet fully mature in their devotion, are more merciful and kind than mundaners.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, it's true that materialists can appear a lot more kind than devotees. As long as your association with them will benefit them by helping them to move forward in their personal or collective goals, they will generally be nice to you and also accommodating. Krsna describes this mentality in His conversation with the gopis:</p>\r\n<p>'So-called friends who show affection for each other only to benefit themselves are actually selfish. They have no true friendship, nor are they following, the true principles of religion. Indeed, if they did not expect benefit for themselves, they would not reciprocate.' (SB 10.32.17)</p>\r\n<p>In the commentary before that verse, Visvanath Chakravarti Thakur rephrases part of the gopis' question to Krsna to which He gave the above answer:</p>\r\n<p>'There are some people who only respect those who respect them. Their respect is conditional. They give respect expecting something, and if they do not get that, then they no longer give respect. This is conditional love.'</p>\r\n<p>In other words (or to put it more bluntly) if someone finds out that you're no longer interested in feeding their egos or their wallets, then they generally will take measures to reject you.</p>\r\n<p>Of course there are philanthropically inclined people who are more pious. But they also have their limits within the realm of their philanthropically motivated goals.</p>\r\n<p>Devotees have no personal investment in their dealings-- at least serious devotees. They get their fulfillment from a place beyond their day-to-day social dealings. Giving without expectation of return is the platform from which serious devotees operate. And even if you don't meet their expectations, they will not reject you. They know the power of the illusory energy. And they know how a spiritually weak, but non-offensive devotee can fall victim to her powerful influence.</p>\r\n<p>Please remember this and be assured that due to weakness, which is also influenced by mundane association, you will not be rejected by devotees for not living up to their expectations of you. As long as there is the slightest spark, or desire, for Krsna consciousness (and in your case there is a lot more than a spark) serious devotees will always be there to encourage you, though they generally will not try to force you.\"</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>",

Since they've arrived, every day while taking prasadam, I watch some of the DVD and listen to the remembrances given by devotees who were present with Srila Prabhupada during each particular lila. It's been the most relishable part of my day.\r\n\r\nYesterday I finished (or at least \"thought\" I finished) the entire DVD series. DVD #11 ended by showing Srila Prabhupada's last visit to Vrndavana in 1977. When the credits and special thanks were shown, as they were shown at the end of every previous DVD, I assumed that the DVD was finished. But when the DVD returned to the main menu, I saw a menu item entitled \"Final Pastimes.\"I clicked on it and realized that there was more to watch on the DVD. I decided to save the last part for today.\r\n\r\nAfter watching part of \"Final Pastimes,\" I began to realize why Yadubara Prabhu set the DVD up in this way. My conclusion is that he left it up to the viewer to decide whether or not he/she wants to watch Srila Prabhupada's final pastimes. To watch and listen to the devotees speak about Srila Prabhupada's tirobhava was heart wrenching.\r\n\r\nI know that Srila Prabhupada gave his permission for his tirobhava pastimes to be filmed. He had his reason for allowing all of his followers to see the way he departed. But it became too difficult for me to watch. I lost my appetite and became too emotional to do anything other than put my coat on, grab my japa beads, and leave for a long walk. There was nothing else I could think of doing at that moment but take shelter of the Holy Name and pray that some day I will be able to sincerely follow in the footsteps of my beloved spiritual master.\r\n\r\nHare Krsna",

DVD #11 ended by showing Srila Prabhupada's last visit to Vrndavana in 1977. When the credits and special thanks were shown, as they were shown at the end of every previous DVD, I assumed that the DVD was finished. But when the DVD returned to the main menu, I saw a menu item entitled \"Final Pastimes.\"I clicked on it and realized that there was more to watch on the DVD. I decided to save the last part for today.</p>\n<p>After watching part of \"Final Pastimes,\" I began to realize why Yadubara Prabhu set the DVD up in this way. My conclusion is that he left it up to the viewer to decide whether or not he/she wants to watch Srila Prabhupada's final pastimes. To watch and listen to the devotees speak about Srila Prabhupada's tirobhava was heart wrenching.</p>\n<p>I know that Srila Prabhupada gave his permission for his tirobhava pastimes to be filmed. He had his reason for allowing all of his followers to see the way he departed. But it became too difficult for me to watch. I lost my appetite and became too emotional to do anything other than put my coat on, grab my japa beads, and leave for a long walk. There was nothing else I could think of doing at that moment but take shelter of the Holy Name and pray that some day I will be able to sincerely follow in the footsteps of my beloved spiritual master.</p>\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\n",

During this visit she described my condition in more detail than she had in the past and said that in my present state one of the worst things I could do would be to fly in an airplane. She further explained how cabin pressure in an airplane adversely affects the lymphatic system.

Much has happened since Amekhala's chemo treatment 12 days ago. It has been very difficult. She was discharged home three days after but must have picked up a stomach bug while in hospital. She got bad diarrhea and vomiting and had to be re-hospitalised for 48 hours for rehydration etc. and then discharged. </div><div> </div><div><img width=\"180\" height=\"271\" vspace=\"2\" hspace=\"2\" border=\"4\" align=\"left\" alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/webfm/Fileshare/Miscellaneous/IMG_3036.jpg\">On coming home she still felt sick and would not keep anything down and started getting severely dehydrated. It became more severe each day. Yesterday, Jan. 19 she had a fever of 40 C. 102 F. We spent all day yesterday trying to convince her to be readmitted for more rehydration because we knew it was a temporary hitch to a potentially curable problem. She had septicemia. </div><div> </div><div>She did not want to go back to the hospital. She was ready to leave her body and would have within the next 24 hours. She was very peaceful and just wanted to have kirtan at the house. Over 50 devotees came from the surrounding area from 5 p.m. onwards. One doctor made a house call at 4:00 and advised her to go to the hospital but she refused. </div><div> </div><div>Throughout the afternoon and evening she spoke with everyone, smiling brightly and was more and more peaceful. She had different visions or dreams. Each one allowing her to be more peaceful. All her fear had gone. She hadn't had any food or drink for days and was just sucking on ice cubes. It was the only thing that didn't come back up. </div><div> </div><div>At 10:00 a very wonderful and sensitive doctor again came and tried. Again she said she was ready to die and despite all that he said it didn't change. Finally two of her sons and I managed to convince her to go back in just to get the IV's for antibiotics and electrolytes. She agreed and we arrived there in an ambulance at midnight after more coaxing when they arrived at the door. </div><div> </div><div>Twelve hours later, after her fever reached a peak of 41.5/107F has now has gone done to about normal. She has taken in over two liters of water on her own, in addition to the IV's. She had many wonderful thoughts and realizations she told us. </div><div> </div><div>Many times she mentioned the trick was to realize we are not the doers. Krishna was in control. Once she said but I'm stubborn. She said she understands that Krishna loves us because if He didn't He wouldn't put so much effort into trying to help us.</div><div> </div><div>She saw Srila Prabhupada with a dozen beautiful gardenia garlands around his neck, looking very regal. She said she always thought that he was disgusted with her but now she knows he loves her a little. She saw Mayapur twice. Each time she saw a very young Lord Caitanya, she thinks. Each time He ran away and she knew it wasn't time yet. </div><div> </div><div>She said, \"I have a relevance, I deserve; only because Krishna loves me.\" She also saw a little blue boy who also laughed and ran away.

				"value": "<p>Those of you who have regularly attended the Southern Ukraine Festival and especially most of you who live in Ukraine probably know Srutakirti Prabhu and his wife, Amekhala devi dasi.</p>  <p>During the festival in Kiev I received word from Srutakirti Prabhu that Amekhala devi dasi was diagnosed as having a diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma which surrounded her left pelvis and had encased her kidneys. It was very serious and complete kidney failure was not very far off.</p>  <p>The doctors had to immediately begin chemotherapy for five days and said that they must continue chemotherapy once every three weeks for four months more.</p>  <p>I was unable to stay in daily communication with Srutakirti Prabhu because of my intense schedule in Kiev. However, two days ago I received the following update:</p>  <p>\"Dear family and friends,</p>  <p>It was a good day today. She came home this afternoon. Her creatinine levels in her kidneys dropped another 15 points from 150 to 135 and she was told her tumor has reduced as there was softness in her left side which was very firm just a few days ago. So we are happy for our small blessings and ready to start giving her lots of nice food, drinks and prayers at home. It is just the beginning of the battle but at least we know what we are fighting. I won't write so often now unless there is something new to report. Thank you again for your support and prayers.</p>  <p>with love and affection,</p>  <p>Sruta\" [end of quote]</p>  <p>This morning I immediately wrote to Srutakirti Prabhu to explain the reason behind my lapse in communication and to request him to continue to update me so that I can keep everyone informed about Amekhala dd's progress on my website.</p>  <p>His reply was as follows: <o:p></o:p></p>    <p>\"Dear Maharaja,</p>  <p>Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.</p>  <p>No need to beg forgiveness Maharaja. I understand and so does Amekhala. I am sure your disciple was in a good place mentality by your assistance and I know how caring you must have been.<o:p></o:p> <o:p></o:p></p>    <p>Amekhala's situation is serious.

It was very serious and complete kidney failure was not very far off.</p>\n<p>The doctors had to immediately begin chemotherapy for five days and said that they must continue chemotherapy once every three weeks for four months more.</p>\n<p>I was unable to stay in daily communication with Srutakirti Prabhu because of my intense schedule in Kiev. However, two days ago I received the following update:</p>\n<p>\"Dear family and friends,</p>\n<p>It was a good day today. She came home this afternoon. Her creatinine levels in her kidneys dropped another 15 points from 150 to 135 and she was told her tumor has reduced as there was softness in her left side which was very firm just a few days ago. So we are happy for our small blessings and ready to start giving her lots of nice food, drinks and prayers at home. It is just the beginning of the battle but at least we know what we are fighting. I won't write so often now unless there is something new to report. Thank you again for your support and prayers.</p>\n<p>with love and affection,</p>\n<p>Sruta\" [end of quote]</p>\n<p>This morning I immediately wrote to Srutakirti Prabhu to explain the reason behind my lapse in communication and to request him to continue to update me so that I can keep everyone informed about Amekhala dd's progress on my website.</p>\n<p>His reply was as follows: <p></p></p>\n<p>\"Dear Maharaja,</p>\n<p>Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.</p>\n<p>No need to beg forgiveness Maharaja. I understand and so does Amekhala. I am sure your disciple was in a good place mentality by your assistance and I know how caring you must have been.<p></p> <p></p></p>\n<p>Amekhala's situation is serious.

				"value": "<p>During the past week I've been trying to budget my sitting time to dedicate as much time as possible for reviewing material which is being prepared for my next book, \"Lectures from a Disciple, Volume 3.\" This is probably one of the main reasons why I haven't posted a blog for over a week.</p>\r\n<p>This morning I was reviewing the following short talk which I gave on September 16, 2006, in Boston on the anniversary day of Srila Prabhupada's arrival in America at Commonwealth Pier. I generally do not post transcriptions from old lectures into my blogs, but because this was a short talk and since a blog from me is long overdue, I decided to use this for today's post.</p>\r\n<p>After harinama to Commonwealth Pier, there was a seminar given at the temple to discuss some of the important principles found in Srila Prabhupada's \"Markine Bhagavata-dharma.\" I arrived a little late for the seminar and was asked at the end if I had any comments I would like to make regarding the topic. The following were my closing comments:</p>\r\n<p>This talk is also available here on the site in an audio file. The talk is in English only. You can find this audio file by going to the following link:</p>\r\n<p>Fileshare / Lectures / Audio / 2006</p>\r\n<p>Hare Krsna</p>\r\n<p>If I am going to speak for a few minutes, then I should speak about substance, rather then form. And substance goes back to the quote that was pulled out from Prabhupada’s Markine Bhagavata-dharma, specifically quoting Prabhupada saying, “I can simply repeat your message. So if you like, you can make my power of speaking suitable for their understanding”. Prabhupada is here expressing his deep, utter helplessness and dependence on Krsna’s will. It’s like the story which is told about how Prabhupada used to go to Advaita Acharya’s in Santipur. Before Prabhupada began the movement, Srila Prabhupada used to go there regularly, and he would simply sit at the back and the pujari used to see Prabhupada. This was before ISKCON, before anything.  And the pujari would see Prabhupada just sitting there chanting for a long period of time. He came a few times, and the pujari never spoke to him. And then there was a long period of time when Prabhupada wasn’t there, and then when the pujari saw Prabhupada again, he approached him.   Prabhupada had been sitting there for a very long time, just chanting and chanting and tears were coming from his eyes. The pujari asked Srila Prabhupada: “What are you doing?”</p>\r\n<p>Prabhupada said: “I have been given an order to go to the West” (and it was just before Prabhupada had left on the Jaladuta). And he said: “I’ve come here to this sacred place and I am simply praying very intensely, very deeply on how I can fulfill this order”. That was his total meditation. That’s what he carried with him on the Jaladuta. That’s what he carried with him to Commonwealth Pier when he wrote Markine Bhagavata-dharma. Prabhupada carried very deep conviction, compassion and substance. And he brought with him the desire to fulfill the higher order, coming down through the disciplic succession. That in of itself was sufficient, but Prabhupada was also filled with an overwhelming sense of compassion and Krsna consciousness. But it’s not just that he was carrying out an order; although he was carrying out blindly as we see here. Blindly in the sense that he had such firm faith in the order and in the Holy Name. But it was not just that he was carrying out an order.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes when we hear, “He was just doing it out of duty,” then it loses its immediacy, it loses its sense of compassion—“probably because it’s just something done out of duty.”</p>\r\n<p>Just like when somebody preaches to somebody and if he’s just saying, “Well, I’m just doing it out of duty,” then the other person feels like, “Oh, that’s all you can get out of it to talk to me.” But Prabhupada was carrying more then just the duty to execute the order. He was carrying a deep desire to give Krsna and to make Krsna accessible to others. He didn’t only want to make them understand. He wanted to awaken their faith, sraddha, and by his own example, he wanted to build that faith from sraddha all the way to prema.</p>\r\n<p>When the pure devotee’s message enters the heart, as he quotes Bhagavatam, then what does it do? It creates a revolution in the heart of that person—that that person actually gets darsan. Just as it says in the Bhagavatam:</p>\r\n<p>“What is the value of a prolonged life which is wasted, inexperienced by years in this world? Better a moment of full consciousness, because that gives one a start in searching after his supreme interest.” (SB 2.1.12)</p>\r\n<p>Prabhupada wanted to give that moment of full consciousness to everyone, because when one gets a glimpse of Krsna, then everything else is pale.</p>\r\n<p>“My dear Vyäsa, even though a devotee of Lord Kåñëa sometimes falls down somehow or other, he certainly does not undergo material existence like others [fruitive workers, etc.] because a person who has once relished the taste of the lotus feet of the Lord can do nothing but remember that ecstasy again and again.” (SB 1.5.19)</p>\r\n<p>Prabhupada was giving darsan with Krsna.</p>\r\n<p>I was here in the early seventies, and I can tell you what drove everybody mad to spread Krsna consciousness.  It was the darsan of Krsna that Srila Prabhupada was giving in our hearts. That’s what drove us mad. And we became so mad that having once tasted it, we wanted to taste it more and more. And what gave us the impetus? It was Prabhupada’s smile. Prabhupada’s pleasure gave us the impetus.  We knew that by pleasing Prabhupada, we were pleasing Krsna. That’s substance.</p>\r\n<p>Just like Gurudas Prabhu was just at the Odessa festival. I was supposed to be there, but I couldn’t go there because of my health.  But I was doing a video broadcast with the devotees in Odessa just a few days ago. We (myself and Radhanath Maharaj) did it over the internet. I was speaking to 2,500 devotees. And Gurudas was there. I had invited him this year. And he tells so many stories.</p>\r\n<p>I was there in Pune when he, Syamasundar and Malati were together telling stories of the early days and of the sacrifices and of the desire to please Prabhupada and the desire to give Krsna to others because they knew it was pleasing to Prabhupada. They were ready to do anything and to make any personal sacrifice, because they were driven by that unmotivated desire. There was no agenda. That purity, that sense of purpose, that sense of mission was inculcated in the hearts of Prabhupada’s followers, because Prabhupada wanted so much for us to get that darsan of Krsna so that we will be ready to keep on making those sacrifices and do whatever is necessary to see Krsna face-to-face.</p>\r\n<p>That’s the value of the association of the devotee. Therefore even a moment’s association… one moment can give that person to search after his ultimate interest. And if we lose that sense of urgency, we will become complacent and forget that actually that’s our goal. That goal is achieved by pleasing Krsna’s pure devotee who has no other desire in his heart than to please the Lord. That’s how it is accomplished. No other way. Krsna has already established that that’s His method for purifying the planet. He says:</p>\r\n<p>“With the dust of My devotees' lotus feet I desire to purify the material worlds, which are situated within Me. Thus, I always follow the footsteps of My pure devotees, who are free from all personal desire, rapt in thought of My pastimes, peaceful, without any feelings of enmity, and of equal disposition everywhere.” (SB 11.14.16)</p>\r\n<p>Krsna says: “I follow in their footsteps, taking their dust.”  That’s Prabhupada’s mission. That’s what he did. He taught us by his example. We saw in Prabhupada somebody who is ready to sacrifice everything. Now, are we prepared to do that to make people Krsna conscious? We can make all the trappings we want to try to attract people, but where are we going bring them once we have captured them? Have we accomplished our mission by getting followers? We’ve not accomplished our mission by getting followers. We’ve accomplished our mission by giving Krsna consciousness to others and awakening the desire in their hearts to become a pure devotee in this life.</p>\r\n<p>That’s what Prabhupada’s mission is. We cannot change it to something else.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, when I read this this verse from Markine Bhagavata-dharma, I always try to look  at the essence of Prahupada’s mood and just how much he is feeling himself helplessly dependent upon Krsna. And therefore because he is feeling so helplessly dependent on Krsna, Krsna is embracing Prabhupada in His arms, and impregnating Prabhupada’s words with such a deep sense of desire. When I listen to those lectures from 1966 in New York, Prabhupada is so animated! So animated! His heart is bubbling, just like a caring father, wanting so much.</p>\r\n<p>In those lectures in 1966, he was speaking right from Caitanya Caritamrta about mother Yasoda, Nanda Maharaja, the cowherd boys and Vrndavana.  He was bubbling with the desire to make people Krsna conscious. We never experienced anything else in Prabhupada’s presence than that bubbling desire to give Krsna. And that’s what captured our hearts, and that’s what makes us want to make this life successful by doing something to make Prabhupada smile. And if some day we can become so blessed to be able to do that which he wants us to do, then that’s the only reason why we live in this world. There is nothing else. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat’s what I see as the essence of Markine Bhagavata and because you’ve asked me to speak, I felt it was more essential to emphasize this point, rather than anything else.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHare Krsna.</p>",

I am wishing that I could be among all of you, preaching in the front lines, tasting the austerities which come, in a very natural way, from attempting to induce non-devotees to voluntarily surrender the fruits of their labor to purchase one of Srila Prabhupada's books.\r\n\r\nSrila Prabhupada is pleased by these efforts, of this I am sure. There is no need for any other consideration in this endeavor. Simply think of Srila Prabhupada's pleasure when you approach someone to engage them in taking a book. Everything else will come. Realizations, mercy, a glimpse of a sweet taste, humility, and the desire to do more to please Krsna's devotee— all the characteristics of devotional service described in Lord Krsna's concluding statements to Narada Muni in the first part of Brhad Bhagavatamrta—will naturally come. Do not be discouraged if they don't come right away. They will come according to the degree of our surrender.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample from one of the many different pieces of news I received during this past week:\r\n\r\n\"I am not doing much Guru Maharaja, hardly 10 books a day. I am sometimes standing on the street without speaking to anyone, sometimes I feel like crying, sometimes I feel extremely cold and sometimes completely exhausted. But for the first time of my life, I don’t care so much about all those discomforts. I am experiencing a new feeling that I never experienced before. This new feeling of being ready to tolerate rain, wind, cold for your pleasure Guru Maharaja.  This feeling that even though I am not very good at it I feel that I am doing the right thing. Knowing that effort can please you and please Srila Prabhupada give me a satisfaction and a desire to do more. Srila Prabhupada explain how it doesn’t matter to live in hell or in heaven when our mission is to distribute books. And for the first time I understand a little more the meaning of it. \r\n  \r\nGoing on books seems to be like going on an adventure with Krsna, The Supreme Personality of Godhead. It help me to realize the personal relationship with Krsna. Sometimes He encourages us, sometime He is testing our determination. Sometime He shows us His Supreme power and His inconceivable mercy and all the time He demonstrate His Supreme control. It is a very powerful way to understand how insignificant I am and to practice to become His instrument. \r\n  \r\nI don’t understand why it took me so long to start this and taste that special nectar. \r\n  \r\nGoing out on books shows a visual aspect of Srimad Bhagavatam, how Kali yuga is filled with so much suffering. I become more convince how Srila Prabhupada’s books and the Holy Names are the only remedy for the suffering of this world. Slowly I feel more compassion and a stronger desire to distribute books arises in my heart.\r\n  \r\nSrila Prabhupada’s books seems now to become more alive. Verses have another dimension that I never experienced before. A certain sweetness that I never had. This experience of book distribution really helps me to focus on taking shelter of Krsna’s Holy Names. In certain situations that we can face in the street it becomes clear  how there is no other shelter than His Holy Names.\" [end of quote]\r\n\r\nToday is December 19th. There are six days left between now and Christmas Eve. If you haven't attempted to distribute some of Srila Prabhupada's books yet, or if you don't have a Sankirtan story or realization to share with me or with other devotees yet, there is still time left to do this. Even a few books distributed will be pleasing to Srila Prabhupada.\r\n\r\nIn this connection Srila Prabhupada wrote and it has so many times been quoted, \"I remember that my Guru Maharaja would often send young boys out to sell literature of Krishna Consciousness, and if they would come back having sold only a few issues, Guru Maharaja was very, very pleased.

While listening to this talk, I was strongly moved by Srila Prabhupada's call for \"everyone to go back home, back to Godhead.\"<!--StartFragment--></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for your coming here to participate in this Krsna consciousness movement. We are calling everyone to go back to home, back to Godhead. This is our movement, Krsna consciousness movement. Just now we described the place where we intend to go. That is Goloka Vrndavana. There the Supreme Personality of Godhead is residing with His consort Radharani. Radha-Madhava. Krsna is the husband -- not exactly husband, but friend. The same mellow. As you try to enjoy here, boy and girlfriend, not married, but an extra ecstasy without being married, conjugal love, the ideal conjugal love is there, Krsna and Radha. Here the same thing is present, but in a perverted sense. The origin is there. Jaya radha-madhava kunja-vihari. Radha and Krsna, They are always engaged in loving affairs in the kunja, in the bushes of Vrndavana. Jaya radha-madhava kunja-vihari, gopijana-vallabha. He is very dear to the gopis and the gopas. Gopas means the cowherd men and the cowherd boys.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So Vrndavana is village life. It is not a town like Los Angeles. It is village. It is village, and they are always taking pleasure on the bank of Yamuna. Yamuna-tira-vana-cari. And there are very nice gardens on the bank of the Yamuna. And whenever there is some danger... Of course, in the original Vrndavana there is no question of danger. It is blissful, transcendental abode. But when Krsna comes down to show us the replica of the original Vrndavana... That Vrndavana is there on this planet in India, about ninety miles from New Delhi. It is exactly the same Vrndavana, but because it is on this material world, it appears that there is sometimes danger. So when Krsna was present on this earth, on this planet, so there was some danger. Actually there was no danger because Krsna was present. But it appeared like that. So there was torrents of rain for seven days. The Indra, the demigod who is in charge of the watering department of this universe, he... (someone laughs) Don't laugh. It is very serious. So he became very angry. Krsna stopped demigod worship, Indra worship, so he became very angry. So there was torrents of rain for seven days continually, and Krsna took up a hill which is called Govardhana Hill -- if sometimes you come to Vrndavana, you will see the Govardhana is there -- as the umbrella on the, what is called finger, ring finger? No. Small finger. So jaya radha-madhava kunja-vihari, gopijana-vallabha giri-vara-dhari. Immediately lifted the big mountain as umbrella like this. So when Krsna was present, although He was playing like an ordinary human child or human being, still, when there was need, He manifested His godly power. That is God. When it was needed to protect the inhabitants of Vrndavana, He lifted a big hill, and since then His name is Giri-vara-dhari. Giri-vara-dhari means that hill, and He sustained that hill. He was at that time seven years old from material calculation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But in the original Vrndavana there is no such thing as the wrath of Indra, the king of heaven, and danger or torrents of rain overflood, inundation. There is no such thing. There everything is blissful, transcendental and eternal. Here we have got a little sample, because whatever you have got in this material world, that is simply imitation, a shadow of the original. Sometimes... You can understand that on the desert sometimes it appears there is a vast ocean of water, mirage. But actually there is no water. Those who are animals, they sometimes are misled. They are thirsty, and they think that there is water in the desert, and they run over, but actually there is no water. The animal runs, and the water also advances. In this way, when he becomes too much fatigued, he dies. This is the exact example of this material world. We are hankering after water, we are thirsty, and we are being misled by so-called water, mirage, Just like while I was coming here, both sides, the manifestation of material civilization, electrical wire pumping station of oil, big, big motorcars light, motel, hotel and so many things... So we are thinking that these things will give us relief; our thirst will be quenched, our hankering for water will be satisfied. But it has failed. In your country especially -- not in your country, in all countries -- so many young flowers of your country, they are frustrated. That's a fact. (aside:) What is that sound? They are frustrated. That is a fact. You know; I know. So this kind of mirage, showing of water -- actually there is no water -- a shadow of water will not help us. That is a fact. But because there is shadow of water, we can understand that there is real water. It is not that the shadow of water is all in all, finished. There is water. But we have to seek out that water elsewhere, not in the desert. In the desert the shadow of water will not quench your thirst.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So that information we are giving. Krsna consciousness movement means that you do not know where that water is to be found, how your great thirst will be satisfied. That you do not know.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum<br />\r\ndurasaya ye bahir-artha-maninah<br />\r\nandha yathandhair upaniyamanas<br />\r\nte 'pisa-tantryam uru-damni-baddhah<br />\r\n[SB 7.5.31]</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">They do now know what is the ultimate goal of life, our self-interest. Everyone must be self-interested, but we do not know what is self-interest. There is no education what is the ultimate goal of life. Na te viduh. They are trying to satisfy themselves to become happy and prosperous by adjusting this material nature. Bahir-artha-maninah. Bahir-artha-maninah means giving more importance to this materialistic way of life. That is called bahir-artha-maninah. God has got many energies. Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]. In the Vedas we understand that the Supreme Lord has manifold energies, and whatever we see, that is the activities of His energy. Just like electric energy. The energy is coming out from the powerhouse, and by utilizing that electric energy, we are working in so many ways: heater, cooler, this microphone, tape recorder, so many things. But the energy is coming from that powerhouse. Similarly, whatever you are seeing, wonderful action of the material action and reaction, they are simply interaction of different energies of the Lord, heat and light. Any scientist will understand that this whole cosmic manifestation is creation of heat and light, two energies. The two energies are coming from the sun, and the material world is creation of the sunshine, heat and light. Similarly there are two energies of God, heat and light. So one is called material energy, another is called spiritual energy, although both of them coming from the supreme spirit, exactly like heat and light is coming from the sun. But heat is not light; light is not heat. There is distinction. This is called inconceivable one and difference simultaneously. Acintya-bhedabheda tattva. This is our philosophy. Nothing is different from God, but not that everything is God. Simultaneous one and different.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So two energies are working, material and spiritual. The spiritual energy is called superior, and the material energy is called inferior. Just like matter. Material energy means earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence, ego, and spiritual energy means spiritual force, the living force. So every one of us, combination of two energies, spiritual energy and material energy. You can understand it. As soon as the spiritual energy is off from the combination of this material energy, it is simply lump of matter. It cannot move. That is stated in the Bhagavad-gita: yaya idam dharyate jagat. The whole world is moving by the combination of material and spiritual energy, and both of them coming from one source, exactly like that, that both heat and light is coming from the sun. But they are working differently or working combinedly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So this world, this material world, although it is not different from God, but still, it is not God. So we have to transfer ourself from this material energy to the spiritual energy. That is the business.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hare Krsna.</p>\r\n<!--EndFragment-->",

				"value": "In response to a request made here on this site to clarify statements I've made in Minsk and in Kiev about my future aspirations for serving the devotees in my capacity as GBC, I will explain here what I've said, what were my intentions, and what some of my plans are for the future.\r\n\r\nIn Kiev I gave a a talk to the leaders present in the National Council meeting and then answered everyone's questions. The essence of my talk was that I wish to withdraw from direct management within Ukraine and Moldova and I wish to leave the managerial decisions up to the National Council with Acyuta Priya remaining as Regional Secretary. I explained the history of the new issues which surfaced with my health earlier this year, and to some degree, I touched upon the issues of the past few years. I also gave reference to the cummulative effect that dealing with conflicts between leaders has had on my health.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke about my dealings with conflicts in that meeting, I was referring to conflicts with which I've had to deal within the jurisdiction of my entire GBC zone, which includes Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Kaliningrad, Lithuania, Moscow, Moscow Central Region, St. Petersburg Region and Northeast United States, and I was not speaking exclusively about Ukraine and Moldova. Some time ago I had to deal with leadership conflicts in the United States which went on for several months and which took a serious toll on my health. And then more recently I had to deal with conflicts elsewhere, though fortunately, because my health seems to be gradually improving, it did not affect my health as much as it has been affected by conflicts before.\r\n\r\nNonetheless my statements in the Ukraine National Council Meeting about withdrawing from management were specifically directed to the leaders within Ukraine and Moldova, and not elsewhere, because in that region there is a working National Council and there is Acyuta Priya dasa, who is a responsible and experienced Regional Secretary who has already been serving in that capacity for many years.\r\n\r\nIn that meeting I expressed my desire for the Ukraine/Moldova leaders to mature further in their roles as leaders and to learn to resolve their conflicts amongst themselves. This statement was not at all something new. This was exactly the same theme which both H.H. Bhaktivaibhava Swami and I discussed with the same leaders during the last National Council Meeting that we both attended together in September, 2008, during the the time of the Evpatoriya Festival. In fact, Bhaktivaibhava Swami explained this point to the leaders with much greater emphasis at that time than I did. I have since better understood why.\r\n\r\nHowever, I thought I made it clear in last week's National Council Meeting that I have no plans for withdrawing my active participation in the affairs of the Ukraine/ Moldova region. On the contrary, I told everyone present that my plan was to spend a good portion of my time next year in Ukraine (though I hope to visit other areas outside Ukraine as well), that I would base myself in one place in Ukraine, and that it was my hope to gradually visit most of the major cities next year in Ukraine, not only to spend time with the devotees in general, but especially to associate with the leaders and senior devotees, to personally encourage them, to advise them about their own spiritual lives, and to give whatever guidance I could about their lives as sadhakas and as managerial leaders. To that degree, I am planning to continue to manage. I would also like to assist the managers by preaching a unified vision for developing their yatras, placing special emphasis on taking care of devotees. I will also take part in some National Council meetings, whenever I can, to observe and to give advice if required.\r\n\r\nA similar point was also expressed in the following quote from my blog two days ago:\r\n\r\n\"In general, I wanted to be present as much as possible to observe the retreat, though naturally, I also wanted to contribute to the retreat by speaking each day and by leading some kirtans. As I mentioned in my interview, I am definitely satisfied by observing the direction this system of care has been moving in Ukraine and Moldova, especially seeing that there now seems to be an increased awareness of the need for a developed system of caring for devotees in general. But there is still a lot of work that needs to be done before the system includes more senior devotees who can feel sheltered, wanted, and needed for participating within this system. If Krsna allows me, it is my desire to personally give attention to this aspect of its development next year.\"\r\n\r\nSo, again, we see this same point. If my health will allow it, I would like to resume traveling in Ukraine to give classes, lead kirtans, and to focus on associating with and encouraging senior devotees to become more active in their own Krsna consciousness, in community affairs, and to do whatever I can to help them individually so that they can share their experiences and realizations with the younger generation of devotees through counseling. I feel that would be the best use of the limited time and energy I still have left with respect to Ukraine and Moldova, rather than having to focus on conflicts when I visit each center.\r\n\r\nIt is my wish, and with my full support, that Acyuta Priya dasa will continue to emphasize the need for developing the counseling system throughout the Ukraine/ Moldova region. He will also continue to attend the GBC Deputy meetings in Mayapura each year and hopefully, to some degree, the GBC meetings, so that he can represent GBC discussions and decisions to the Ukrainian yatra.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty much the essence of what I spoke about at the Ukraine National Council Meeting last week, although I have elaborated upon the same points a little more here.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means a complete account of what my responsibilities and plans for the future are for the other areas within my GBC jurisdiction. Each region is unique and has different contributing factors, such as more active co-GBC's, less active co-GBC's, no co-GBC, no Regional Secretaries or National Councils, and also the existence of a Regional mangerial body to which each temple is accountable, such as the the way the situation exists in North America. It is not possible to give an exhaustive explanation of how I will participate in each of these areas in the immediate and long-range future within the context of this blog.\r\n\r\nI am therefore specifically addressing the issues here which I discussed in Kiev with reference only to Ukraine and Moldova.\r\n\r\nBut there is also another side to my future, which is my accountability to the GBC body and my participation in GBC meetings. Due to health reasons I have not been able to attend a GBC meeting since March, 2005. And though I have been planning to attend next year's meetings in February, I am again being cautioned by the medical practitioners who are presently overseeing my immediate health issues that I need to stay in one place for \"at least\" another three months and remain focused on health improvement or run the risk of further irreversible consequences. Therefore whatever plans I have for continuing with my GBC duties, in whatever capacity I plan to fulfill them, must be confirmed and sanctioned by the GBC Body, and/or the GBC Executive Committee.\r\n\r\nConsidering the point mentioned above, between now and February 6th, the day when the International GBC meetings will begin in Mayapura, I plan to discuss these plans with other GBC members and to get the blessings from the GBC Body or the GBC Executive Committee to serve in the capacity which I have described, in case I will not be able to attend the GBC meetings next year.\r\n\r\nI hope this explanation answers the question which was posted on this site regarding the statements I made last week in Kiev during the National Council Meeting.\r\n\r\nHare Krsna.\r\n",

			"Body_raw": {
				"value": "<!--StartFragment-->\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I returned to Budapest on the evening of November 18th from one week in Kiev. I have to admit, that after my Belarus trip, Holy Name Weekend in New Vraja Dhama, and then one week in Kiev participating in temple programs, fully participating in the National Counselor Retreat, the National Council Meeting on Monday, and then many hours of personal meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, right up until the time of my departure to Boryspil Airport, by the time I arrived in Budapest I needed a lot of rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a phone conversation with my therapist two days ago, after she heard the details of what's going on with my back and the shooting pains I'm getting elsewhere, she insisted that I completely stop all travel again for three more months. I asked her to please re-evaluate the time required for further recovery after she can directly observe my condition, something she hasn't been able to do for almost two months.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">My therapist gave birth approximately six weeks ago and is on maternity leave for at least two months, but she said that she will make an exception for me and will see me next week. I will also see Yasomatinandana dasa, my doctor, on Monday, November 23rd.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whatever both of them say, or whatever you may hear from other reports, I just want to assure everyone that I have no intentions of canceling or postponing Vyasa Puja in Kiev from January 8 – 10. Other than that trip, however, I have no immediate plans to travel anywhere other than to New Vraja Dhama.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would also like to take this opportunity to mention that my godbrother, H.H. Giriraja Maharaja, has already booked his tickets to Kiev in order to spend time with me there and he very much wants to take part in the festival from January 8 – 10. He will arrive in Kiev on January 5th and will depart from Kiev on January 13th. I requested him, and he has already agreed, to give at least two classes during the three-day festival, specifically to pour Srila Prabhupada katha upon everyone attending the festival.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Giriraja Maharaja is an ocean of Srila Prabhupada katha, having spent so much time with Prabhupada, especially in India. Whenever I stay with him in America, and whenever we sit and talk, he almost always has something new to say about his experiences with Srila Prabhupada. His wisdom is deep, having both observed and imbibed Srila Prabhupada's mood and manner of dealing with his disciples, godbrothers, and all living entities in general. He also received many personal instructions from Srila Prabhupada and is eager to share the realizations he gets from those instructions. His presence in Kiev will be a blessing for all who attend.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is not at all clear what Giriraja Maharaja's (and my) schedule will be in Kiev before and after the festival. It is very likely that we will spend our days together outside the city at least two days before the festival begins and possibly even two days after the festival is over, though it is possible that Giriraja Maharaja may give an evening class or two at the temple before and after the festival. These details will not be worked out until we meet each other on January 6th, the day after his arrival in Kiev.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bhakti Visrambha Madhava Maharaja, whom all of you should already know, has also assured me that he will attend the festival. I am not sure what date he will be arriving in Kiev, but we have tentatively planned to also spend some time together after the festival. I'm sure that, as usual, he will be bubbling with enthusiam for Hari Katha and for sharing slokas with anyone and everyone who comes within hearing range of his ever-flowing stream of verses from sastra.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would like to go back a little to my recent Kiev visit…</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Tuesday, two days after the Kiev Counselor Retreat, I was interviewed for \"Dom Prabhupadi\", the Kiev community newsletter, and was asked several questions about my impressions of the retreat, my vision for further development of spiritual counseling in Ukraine and Moldova, and several other questions related to the system of care for both junior and senior devotees in Ukraine and Moldova. I felt that the answers I gave to these questions were relevant for devotees elsewhere and not only in Ukraine and Moldova. Unfortunately, however, I neglected to record that interview. I therefore do not have anything to post here from that interview on the site. Meanwhile I will try to get a copy of it, at least in Russian, though I'm not sure at this time if we will be able to get an English version. I've been told that the Russian transcription will be available by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In general, I wanted to be present as much as possible to observe the retreat, though naturally, I also wanted to contribute to the retreat by speaking each day and by leading some kirtans. As I mentioned in my interview, I am definitely satisfied by observing the direction this system of care has been moving in Ukraine and Moldova, especially seeing that there now seems to be an increased awareness of the need for a developed system of caring for devotees in general. But there is still a lot of work that needs to be done before the system includes more senior devotees who can feel sheltered, wanted, and needed for participating within this system. If Krsna allows me, it is my desire to personally give attention to this aspect of its development next year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The retreat was thought-provoking. The format was good in that it stimulated dialogue and participation from practically everyone who attended. I was very happy to see that. Presentations were given by senior devotees who have experience with many different aspects of care, from counseling, caring for the terminally ill, education, training, and engaging congregational members. Also much time was given for presentations on how to bring guests and new devotees into the system, to see that they are inspired to engage in the temple services, and especially to insure that their service does not compromise the development of their faith in practicing sadhana and in the process of hearing and chanting about Krsna in the association of more experienced devotees. These are all important areas which will always require attention and will need to be further developed throughout the whole region.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I felt, however, that it would have been nice if some of the speakers would have had more time for their presentations and for questions and answers regarding the particular subject of their presentation. This is a small point, but something to be considered by the organizers for future retreats.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In particular, I was very enlivened by Acyuta Priya dasa's explanation as to why so much time was spent on the second day of the retreat by putting the participants together into four separate groups and requesting them to spontaneously organize, within one and a half hours, two short dramas and two short operas depicting four different lilas of the Lord (1- Krsna's lifting of Govardhana Hill, 2- Krsna and Balarama leaving Vrndavana for Mathura, 3- The chastisement of the Kaliya serpent, and 4- The killing of the Aghasura demon).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I was impressed by the devotees' resourcefulness to employ whatever they could find and whatever they could make, within such a short period of time, to use as props for their dramas. I was also impressed by the composition and the scripts they were able to put together so quickly. It was also nice to see the cooperation and genuine happiness many of the devotees appeared to experience by using their talents in a devotional way.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the beginning of the afternoon session, Acyuta Priya Prabhu summarized this part of the event nicely by emphasizing that devotees need to fill the need for a possible cultural vacuum by spontaneously and joyfully using their talents to express themselves within a Krsna conscious context. Otherwise devotees run to risk of needing to look elsewhere to fill that need.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:RU\">On Sunday, after the morning strategy session for reviewing what was accomplished within Ukraine and Moldova for developing the system of care in 2009, and for making short and long-range plans for 2010, the Sunday Feast program began shortly thereafter. Before beginning my lecture, I asked how many people were present for the program for the first time. Again, I saw so many hands go up. But I also felt the need to speak about the Prabhupada Marathon since it was my last public lecture for all the congregational devotees from Kiev and especially all those who had assembled from throughout Ukraine for the retreat. So I tried my best to present my talk in such a way that both audiences could derive some benefit from the presentation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:RU\">After the lecture, and just before the kirtan began, I noticed that there was simply not enough room in the temple room and on the balcony for everyone to participate in the kirtan. Some of the devotees had to leave for other parts of the temple. Again, another indication that we must hope that the Kiev temple room construction and expansion project can continue as quickly as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:RU\">After the kirtan, according to tradition, all the new guests (it seemed that it was at least 30, but probably more) were enthusiastically received with a garland, mahaprasadam, and some warm words. Usually there is a long line of garlands for each new guest, but as each new guest was received it started to become apparent that there were not going to be enough garlands for all the new guests. An apology was made to those who did not receive garlands, but within a short time I saw that gradually more and more garlands were coming out of the pujari room for the new guests who had not received one yet. When I left the temple room after the announcements, I noticed that Mahamana devi dasi was quickly stringing more garlands in the pujari room so that nobody would be left without one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:RU\">Also, Sunday happened to be the exact day of the 50th wedding anniversary of Sandipani Muni dasa and Prema Sagara devi dasi—long time residents and very active participants in devotee care from Kharkov. An announcement was made, words of appreciation were spoken by several devotees who knew them well, gifts and garland were offered to them, and then both spoke a few humble words, expressing their gratitude for the association of each other and for the association of devotees in general. It was a very nice ending for the Sunday announcements and was greatly appreciated by everyone, including myself, by seeing how a householder couple can stay together and selflessly serve the community of Vaisnavas as householders for so many years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:RU\">After the feast Sadacara dasa and his drama troupe from Dnepropetrovsk put on a very nice drama about the life of Haridasa Thakur. As usual, it was a very impressive performance and was greatly appreciated (judging by the extent of the applaud at the end) by everyone who attended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:RU\">Approximately 800 – 900 pictures have been posted of the retreat, Sunday Program, and the drama in the Photo Gallery on this site.

I have to admit, that after my Belarus trip, Holy Name Weekend in New Vraja Dhama, and then one week in Kiev participating in temple programs, fully participating in the National Counselor Retreat, the National Council Meeting on Monday, and then many hours of personal meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, right up until the time of my departure to Boryspil Airport, by the time I arrived in Budapest I needed a lot of rest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a phone conversation with my therapist two days ago, after she heard the details of what's going on with my back and the shooting pains I'm getting elsewhere, she insisted that I completely stop all travel again for three more months. I asked her to please re-evaluate the time required for further recovery after she can directly observe my condition, something she hasn't been able to do for almost two months.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">My therapist gave birth approximately six weeks ago and is on maternity leave for at least two months, but she said that she will make an exception for me and will see me next week. I will also see Yasomatinandana dasa, my doctor, on Monday, November 23rd.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whatever both of them say, or whatever you may hear from other reports, I just want to assure everyone that I have no intentions of canceling or postponing Vyasa Puja in Kiev from January 8 – 10. Other than that trip, however, I have no immediate plans to travel anywhere other than to New Vraja Dhama.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would also like to take this opportunity to mention that my godbrother, H.H. Giriraja Maharaja, has already booked his tickets to Kiev in order to spend time with me there and he very much wants to take part in the festival from January 8 – 10. He will arrive in Kiev on January 5th and will depart from Kiev on January 13th. I requested him, and he has already agreed, to give at least two classes during the three-day festival, specifically to pour Srila Prabhupada katha upon everyone attending the festival.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Giriraja Maharaja is an ocean of Srila Prabhupada katha, having spent so much time with Prabhupada, especially in India. Whenever I stay with him in America, and whenever we sit and talk, he almost always has something new to say about his experiences with Srila Prabhupada. His wisdom is deep, having both observed and imbibed Srila Prabhupada's mood and manner of dealing with his disciples, godbrothers, and all living entities in general. He also received many personal instructions from Srila Prabhupada and is eager to share the realizations he gets from those instructions. His presence in Kiev will be a blessing for all who attend.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is not at all clear what Giriraja Maharaja's (and my) schedule will be in Kiev before and after the festival. It is very likely that we will spend our days together outside the city at least two days before the festival begins and possibly even two days after the festival is over, though it is possible that Giriraja Maharaja may give an evening class or two at the temple before and after the festival.

The main purpose of my talk was to encourage everyone to take part in the Prabhupada Marathon, and for those who had never participated in a marathon to \"at least\" once in their life taste the sweetness of distributing Srila Prabhupada's books.</p>\r\n<p>I will not repeat the points I made in that talk here because the entire talk will soon be transcribed and will be available for reading in an upcoming blog.</p>\r\n<p>After the talk, one of the Minsk temple book distributors brought into the temple room about 25 copies of the \"Sankirtan\" magazine, a very elaborate, colorful, and high-quality magazine published in Russian to inspire book distribution. All of the copies were sold to the devotees and guests within a matter of minutes. I also signed each magazine before they were taken. When we found out that there were not going to be enough copies available for everyone who wanted one, at least another 30 copies were brought into the temple room, some of them older issues. Much to my pleasure, all of these were also signed and purchased until there were no issues left. It was very pleasing to see how much enthusiasm the devotees and guests displayed, wanting to learn more about this transcendental book distribution.</p>\r\n<p>I also mentioned during part of my talk about my godbrother, Vaisesika Prabhu, and how he inspires book distribution in many places throughout America and other countries throughout the world. Vaisesika Prabhu oversees preaching and book distribution in Northern California and inspires the entire congregation of the San Jose, California devotee community to regularly go out on weekend marathons to distribute Srila Prabhupada's books. During my last visit to San Jose earlier this year, Vaisesika Prabhu told me that approximately 240 devotees went out for the Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur Weekend Marathon and thousands of books were distributed exclusively by congregational devotees.</p>\r\n<p>In order to give the devotees a vision on how to distribute books and especially how to become qualified to distribute Srila Prabhupada's books, Vaisesika Prabhu has put together different \"Power Point\" presentations which he has used to inspire the San Jose devotee community. One of those presentations is as follows.</p>\r\n<p>Please go through each slide of this 81-slide presentation and hopefully you'll find some deeper insights which could inspire you to either catch up or rekindle some enthusiasm to experience for yourself the pleasure found in pleasing Srila Prabhupada through the distribution of his books.</p>\r\n<p>To move the presentation forward, move the cursor to the right side of the frame and a hand pointing right will appear. Just click and each frame will move forward one at a time. To go back, move the cursor to the left side of the frame and a hand pointing left will appear.

The main purpose of my talk was to encourage everyone to take part in the Prabhupada Marathon, and for those who had never participated in a marathon to \"at least\" once in their life taste the sweetness of distributing Srila Prabhupada's books.</p>\n<p>I will not repeat the points I made in that talk here because the entire talk will soon be transcribed and will be available for reading in an upcoming blog.</p>\n<p>After the talk, one of the Minsk temple book distributors brought into the temple room about 25 copies of the \"Sankirtan\" magazine, a very elaborate, colorful, and high-quality magazine published in Russian to inspire book distribution. All of the copies were sold to the devotees and guests within a matter of minutes. I also signed each magazine before they were taken. When we found out that there were not going to be enough copies available for everyone who wanted one, at least another 30 copies were brought into the temple room, some of them older issues. Much to my pleasure, all of these were also signed and purchased until there were no issues left. It was very pleasing to see how much enthusiasm the devotees and guests displayed, wanting to learn more about this transcendental book distribution.</p>\n<p>I also mentioned during part of my talk about my godbrother, Vaisesika Prabhu, and how he inspires book distribution in many places throughout America and other countries throughout the world. Vaisesika Prabhu oversees preaching and book distribution in Northern California and inspires the entire congregation of the San Jose, California devotee community to regularly go out on weekend marathons to distribute Srila Prabhupada's books. During my last visit to San Jose earlier this year, Vaisesika Prabhu told me that approximately 240 devotees went out for the Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur Weekend Marathon and thousands of books were distributed exclusively by congregational devotees.</p>\n<p>In order to give the devotees a vision on how to distribute books and especially how to become qualified to distribute Srila Prabhupada's books, Vaisesika Prabhu has put together different \"Power Point\" presentations which he has used to inspire the San Jose devotee community. One of those presentations is as follows.</p>\n<p>Please go through each slide of this 81-slide presentation and hopefully you'll find some deeper insights which could inspire you to either catch up or rekindle some enthusiasm to experience for yourself the pleasure found in pleasing Srila Prabhupada through the distribution of his books.</p>\n<p>To move the presentation forward, move the cursor to the right side of the frame and a hand pointing right will appear.

				"value": "<!--StartFragment-->\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I returned to Budapest last Friday. Unfortunately, due to the intensity of my schedule during the period just before Govardhana Puja, during Govardhana Puja, and a for a few days after Govardhana Puja, I've experienced setbacks with my back. My back had been much better a few weeks prior to Govardhana Puja, to the point where I was able to take long japa walks, almost effortlessly, and sometimes 4-5 miles every day. Moreover, the doctor did not see the need to give me any injections for the past several weeks. After Govardhana Puja, however, and especially after sitting in many meetings, two days ago the doctor said the the inflammation in the lower spine had substantially increased once again. He had to give me six injections that day and he has to come and see me again early tomorrow morning here at the temple because he is very concerned about an upcoming trip I am planning to Belarus (more about that trip later).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreover, due to inflammation and the other consequences of that inflammation, the therapist had to change my therapy to once every two hours, no sitting for more than 30 minutes, no walking for more than 30 minutes, and mandated that I lie down more frequently.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So all that has affected my daily activity. I have been writing a lot more letters than usual these past several days, but still I have to get up frequently from the chair. I haven't been able to figure out a way to stand and type yet, but that may come in the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">My correspondence these past few days, other than writing many important letters connected to my GBC responsibilities, has especially been centered on refining the system Amsumati devi dasi and I have set up for dealing with both old and new correspondence that she translates for me.</p>\r\n<p style=\"\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Other than correspondence which comes through Amsumati dd, I get many letters from five other sources:</p>\r\n<p style=\"\" class=\"MsoNormal\">1) Direct email (a lot more than probably most of you think that I get)<br />\r\n<o:p></o:p>2) Hand-delivered<br />\r\n<o:p></o:p>3) From Sarva Laksmi dd<br />\r\n4) Contained with counselor reports from Sarva Laksmi dd<br />\r\n5) Postal mail</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These past several days I've also had to deal with correspondence concerning this website and how the layout and translations into Russian can be improved in the future. I'm also trying my best to produce a blog on a regular basis and I also try to make sure that the website gets updated as frequently as possible with some kind of new material.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once GBC issues get a little more sorted out and less of my time is required to deal with these issues, my desire is to gradually start posting more blogs on my readings and on what I am hearing from Srila Prabhupada's lectures while I'm exercising.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I've also resumed watching the \"Following Srila Prabhupada\" series by Yadubara Prabhu over the course of the last few weeks. Every day that I watch them I get ever-fresh realizations on the depth of Srila Prabhupada's compassion. Just the other day I wrote the following in a letter to Yadubara Prabhu:<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>\"It took a little while for #9 to catch up to me because I haven't been in the States since February. Since Sivarama Swami is at the farm right now and I'm staying in Budapest to meet my doctors' appointments, I'm watching #9 every day while I take lunch. Such nectar! I can't tell you how moved I am when I hear these stories and see Krsna's perfect representative before my eyes. As I've told devotees in the past, watching this \"Following Srila Prabhupada\" series is like doing bhajan. For me, it is total absorption. I can't help but think about Krsna when I meditate on Prabhupada by the process you've so expertly given for us to meditate upon him. Thank you so much! I can't wait for #10 and #11!!!\"<o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Other than writing, I've also been averaging at least four international phone calls a day, some lasting as long as two hours, dealing with both personal matters and GBC matters. I also speak regularly with many godbrothers, who either call me or I call them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yesterday, among the several phone conversations I had, I spoke for quite some time with my godbrother Mukta Vandya Prabhu, who unfortunately just recently suffered from his second heart attack. I found out about his heart attack when a scanned letter from him arrived in my email from the Temple President of Boston. His handwriting was shaky because it was a very serious heart attack. So the Temple President of Boston also typed out his message to me and it was as follows:<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 13pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>\"Dear Niranjana Swami,<o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 13pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.<o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 13pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>You might have heard that I had a 2<sup>nd</sup> heart attack. I didn’t think I would live thru it in this body.<o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 13pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>I wanted to tell you I love you &amp; I could never repay you for all you did for me over the years. I thank you for what you’ve done for me &amp; so many others. I hope to see you again. I’ll be in Boston for at least 2 more weeks if you want to write, after that I’ll be in Gita Nagari.<o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 13pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Yours in the service of Prabhupada,<o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Mukta\"</i></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">I've known Mukta Vandya Prabhu for more than 36 years. He is a wonderful devotee and I've spoken publicly about him on several occasions when he had his first heart attack two years ago. But this time, his situation is much more serious. The doctors told him that right now his heart is working at only a 35% capacity, and that there was permanent damage to part of his heart too. Still the doctors say that the 35% could increase if he follows their recommendations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Mukta Vandya repeatedly refers to Krsna's will whenever we talk about his situation. But it seemed that he now also knows a lot better that he has a role to play in that outcome as well, and it's time for him to change the way that he lives.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">I therefore had to request him to put his sister Kathy on the phone so that I could talk with her too. She is very friendly, kind, she loves her younger brother, and she knows very well that I love him too. I spoke with her for quite some time. I wanted to assure her that if she needed help convincing Mukta Vandya to change his lifestyle, I was ready to help her. She was very grateful, but she assured me that after this second heart attack, Mukta Vandya finally got the message that he has to stop working so hard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Mukta Vandya lives in the Gita Nagari Farm in U.S.A, in the corner of the basement of the temple building. He has a business in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania which means that before his second heart attack not only was he working all day with his business, but he had to drive back and forth from the farm for more than one hour each way every day. This business requires a good amount of physical work too, but since his business supports a lot of projects on the farm and many devotees on the farm too, he didn't want to give it up. He hardly ever takes anything from the business for himself. He has been doing this for many years and is an ideal example of a very selfless devotee. <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Yesterday I also spent some time before my late lunch talking with Karunamayi devi dasi and her husband Mahateja dasa who happened to be passing through Budapest. She did not know that I was here when they arrived in Budapest two days ago, but when I heard that she was downstairs, I went down to speak with both of them for awhile while they were taking prasadam.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Then yesterday I decided to spend more time with both of them because I have not had the opportunity to spend much time in person with them since the time Karunamayi was in the automobile accident five years ago which, despite many surgeries and treatments since then, has left her still unable to walk.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">So yesterday the three of us drove a short distance to the banks of the nearby Danube River. We walked and we talked for quite some time along the paved path next to the river, while her husband pushed her briskly along in her wheelchair. After walking a good 1-2 kilometers, we then stopped and while Mahateja and I sat on a bench, Karunamayi enthusiastically continued to share with me the many realizations she's had over the past several years. I was very happy to just hear the many realizations both she and her husband wanted to share with me. Maybe some day, if she's inclined, I may ask her to share them with all of you. But for now, I will say that I could see that she is getting a lot of mercy because she is sincerely trying her best to surrender to Krsna's will.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Also, this afternoon, Sridama, Kisori, and their daughter, Radharani, are scheduled to arrive in Budapest to conduct seminars here on the counseling system and on the grhastha asrama for the upcoming week. Sridama and I have been in regular correspondence about this visit, and as always, I know that they will hope that I will spend some time with them, separately, as well as during their presentations to the Hungarian devotees.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">My original plan was to spend the whole week as much as possible with them between Budapest and the farm, especially because Sivarama Maharaja had a prior commitment which will take him out of Hungary on Saturday morning. But over the course of the past couple of weeks I felt the need to fulfill my GBC duties in Belarus since I have not been there for more than fourteen months. I applied for my Belarussian visa a few days ago, and I will fly to Belarus on November 2nd arriving in the early to mid-afternoon, and will then leave Minsk for Budapest on the 6th shortly after noon. <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">For those of you who are in Belarus, or who might be thinking to visit Belarus during my visit, I will quote the following relevant points from letters written to devotees in Belarus which will hopefully make it clear what should be expected from me during this visit:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>\"There will be no program on November 2nd evening. I will do [short] programs in Minsk on November 3rd evening and November 4th evening. I will try, if my body is still holding up, to go to Vitebsk for a program on November 5th evening, returning to Minsk on the 6th morning. But the trip to Vitebsk will really depend upon the degree of pain in my back on the 5th. Therefore, if there are any devotees from Vitebsk who want to attend programs and are assuming that I will be in Vitebsk on the 5th, they should be told that my trip to Vitebsk is not definite and to visit Minsk would be a safer option.<o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i> <o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>There should be a discussion between Yuga Avatara dasa, Vrikodara dasa and Acyuta Priya dasa on the 2nd morning to make a schedule for my meetings for the 2nd (5 PM - 7 PM), 3rd (11:00 AM to 2:00 PM) and 4th (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM).

I applied for my Belarussian visa a few days ago, and I will fly to Belarus on November 2nd arriving in the early to mid-afternoon, and will then leave Minsk for Budapest on the 6th shortly after noon. <p></p></p>\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0.5in;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">For those of you who are in Belarus, or who might be thinking to visit Belarus during my visit, I will quote the following relevant points from letters written to devotees in Belarus which will hopefully make it clear what should be expected from me during this visit:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>\"There will be no program on November 2nd evening. I will do [short] programs in Minsk on November 3rd evening and November 4th evening. I will try, if my body is still holding up, to go to Vitebsk for a program on November 5th evening, returning to Minsk on the 6th morning. But the trip to Vitebsk will really depend upon the degree of pain in my back on the 5th. Therefore, if there are any devotees from Vitebsk who want to attend programs and are assuming that I will be in Vitebsk on the 5th, they should be told that my trip to Vitebsk is not definite and to visit Minsk would be a safer option.<p></p></i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i> <p></p></i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>There should be a discussion between Yuga Avatara dasa, Vrikodara dasa and Acyuta Priya dasa on the 2nd morning to make a schedule for my meetings for the 2nd (5 PM - 7 PM), 3rd (11:00 AM to 2:00 PM) and 4th (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM). [The meetings on these three days will be related to GBC matters only and only those invited by the assigned secretary for this trip, Acyuta Priya dasa, will be allowed to attend]<p></p></i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i> <p></p></i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>[There may be time on the 5th morning from 10:00 – 12:00 for a few short personal meetings, but my secretary will make the decisions of who and when. Nobody should approach me for a personal meeting.]<p></p></i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i> <p></p></i></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>I cannot say for sure whether there will be a general disciple meeting during this visit or not.

It's a term that oftentimes has been very difficult for me to fully grasp, because it means a great festival, and a mahotsava is usually a day of celebration. As Gaudiya Vaisnavas, traditionally, we observe the disappearance of great Vaisnava acaryas in this way, by celebrating.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But it's also something that's very difficult for me to piece together, these two words— disappearance and celebration— because for those who had even a moment's association of Srila Prabhupada, they know the great value of that moment's association. And to remember even that moment's association is a cause of great distress and not celebration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just to think of what that moment's association has done—to transform one, not to speak of one, but thousands and thousands and thousands of lives, who have been transformed by even a moment's association of Srila Prabhupada.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So once such a greatly empowered Vaisnava leaves our vision, or leaves this world, it is a big loss for the world. And usually when we think of it in this way, there is lamentation. We do not think of celebration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But Srila Prabhupada in his own discourse on the disappearance of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur gave us the perspective that we should have on the disappearance of great Vaisnava acaryas and how to reconcile the celebration and lamentation that simultaneous exists in remembering the association of such greatly empowered Vaisnavas. Their disappearance is a cause for celebration as explained by Srila Prabhupada in the following example:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just as the sun appears in the Eastern horizon and disappears on the Western horizon, in the same way the Vaisnava appears in this world to our vision and then disappears from our vision. But just as the appearance and the disappearance of the sun does not mean that the sun didn't exist before it appeared and then didn't any longer exist after it disappeared from our vision, similarly we understand that when greatly empowered Vaisnavas such as Srila Prabhupada appeared to the vision of the ordinary conditioned souls of this material world, he appeared because he was sent here by Krsna to fulfill a particular purpose.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I was one time sitting with Tamal Krsna Maharaja in Dallas in the early 1990's and Tamal Krsna Maharaja was relating to me the story that Prabhupada had told him. He said that when Krsna asked him to come to this material world— I remember that Tamal Krsna Maharaja told me that this is exactly as Prabhupada told him— he said that Krsna told him to go to the material world and Prabhupada was hesitating to go to the material world. And when Krsna saw Prabhupada's hesitation, He said to Prabhupada, \"That's OK, go, leave your books there, and then you can come back.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So this is an example of how Prabhupada was obviously not a conditioned soul of this material world but was an empowered saktyavesa avatara who appeared in this world to fulfill Krsna's purpose. And he did even more than what Krsna asked him to do.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just like Hanuman when he was sent to Lanka to rescue Sita, he not only rescued Sita but he accomplished much more during his visit to Lanka. He destroyed much of Lanka while doing the service given to him by Lord Ramachandra. Similarly, Prabhupada not only came to this world and composed, wrote, published and distributed his books, and arranged for mass distribution of his books, but he also created a revolution. Sivarama Maharaja just gave testimony to one of the revolutions that Srila Prabhupada led. And that was only one revolution he led, but so many revolutions Srila Prabhupada created in this world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So Prabhupada came, fulfilled Krsna's purpose, and then Prabhupada disappeared from our vision. And just as when the sun disappears from our vision in the Western horizon it still continues to exist in another place, similarly we understand that when Srila Prabhupada left this world and left our vision in 1977 that it is a cause of great celebration because he went to join his worshipful Lord in his continuous, non-stop devotional service to Him.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Therefore we can celebrate the disappearance of a Vaisnava on the day of his disappearance because for that Vaisnava there is no cause for lamentation. When we think of where that Vaisnava is after he disappears from our vision, there is no cause for lamentation. It is simply a cause of celebration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But still we lament. We both simultaneously celebrate the disappearance of the Vaisnava but we lament the loss of the association of that Vaisnava. And that is the simultaneous co-existence of these two moods that exist at Srila Prabhupada's tirobhava-mahotsava, as Srila Prabhupada spoke about, when he spoke about the disappearance of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami Maharaja Thakur.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, the lamentation that we feel is also spiritual because just as the song that Srila Sivarama Maharaja just sang, was the song of lamentation of Narottama dasa Thakur. He was lamenting that, \"Where have all these great acaryas gone, Rupa, Raghunath, Sanatana Goswamis, they have all gone to join Lord Gauranga in His eternal kirtan. And they left me here to beat my head against the stone in great separation of their association.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So certainly that is spiritual lamentation. And for those who feel such lamentation, they can get a glimpse of what it means to associate with a Vaisnava in feelings of separation. It is simultaneously painful but also very sweet. Bittersweet. Bitter because we lose the physical association of Vaisnavas, but sweet because we cannot stop thinking about that Vaisnava, even for a moment. And at least for me it forces me to think of the opportunities that I had to get those moments of association with Srila Prabhupada.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So we should properly observe his disappearance and it is time to observe it since right now is the exact time that he departed. So I will end here. I simply tried to explain at least what feelings I was experiencing as I was sitting here looking at Srila Prabhupada and trying to remind myself that I am supposed to be celebrating on this day of his disappearance whereas I am mostly overwhelmed by lamentation of the loss of his association.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hare Krsna.</p>\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

I will post them here and they will also be posted in the Gallery section from where I believe individual photos can also be downloaded.</p>\r\n<p>The morning of Govardhana Puja began with Mangal Arati, japa, then Guru Puja at 7:30 AM, the Deity Greeting began at approximately 8:15 AM and the kirtan continued right up until approximately 11:00 AM, with an abhiseka for Giriraja from about 10:00 to 11:00 AM. (The full morning kirtan will be posted soon.)</p>\r\n<p>After abhiseka, I then lectured until approximately 12:15 PM, at which time we all went in procession, with Govardhana Lal leading the procession on a beautiful oxcart, to the goshalla to take darshan of Krsna's cows. We also had the opportunity to hear about some of the pastimes of some particular cows in the herd, and especially to hear how important and dear to Krsna are His cows.</p>\r\n<p>Sivarama Maharaja then personally thanked all of the sponsors for their annual sponsorships of the cows, new sponsors came forward to sponsor some of the new cows and oxen in the herd since the previous Govardhana Puja, and after that, go-puja was performed. Then Mahaprasadam was distributed to everyone— all sweets and preparations made directly from milk offered to Radha Syamasundara by Krsna's cows and the vegetables and grains which were produced by ox-power in New Vraja Dhama.</p>\r\n<p>The cows were then let outside and everyone got the opportunity to feed Syamasundara's cows and the bulls fresh carrots from the garden.</p>\r\n<p>The procession returned to the temple room where many devotees were still stacking up heaps and heaps of bhoga which was to be offered to Radha Syamasundara and Sri Govardhana Lal— all 2,450 kilograms of it. Yes, that's right. 2,450 kilograms. This year the Hungarian devotees far exceeded their goal of 2,000 kilograms of sweets which they wanted to offer to Govardhana Lal. And even though Govardhana Lal received all that was offered, Sivarama Maharaja emphasized at the end of my class, that even if Giriraja gets 2,000 kilograms today, Giriraja will still continue to say \"Aniyora, Aniyora\". \"Give me more, Give me more!\"</p>\r\n<p>Kirtan went on during the offering of sweets, and then all the prasadam was removed from the temple room so that there would be enough room to circumambulate the smaller mountain of prasadam in the center of the temple room. While circumambulating Govardhana hill the devotees sang the following song sung by the residents of Vrndavana when they were circumambulating Govardhana Hill (from Gopal Campu):</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<!--StartFragment-->\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Balaram\">giri-pujeyaà vihita kena araci çakra-padam abhayaà yena<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyam vihita kena putanika sa nihata yena<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who made us free from fear of Indra.\"<br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who killed the Pütanä witch.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena tånavarta-tanu-dalanaà yena<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena yamalarjuna-tarum udakali yena<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who crushed the Tåëävarta whirlwind.\"<br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who uprooted the yamala-arjuna trees.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena vatsa-bakasura-hananaà yena<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena vyomaghasura-maraëaà yena<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Balaram\"><br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who killed Vatsäsura and Bakäsura.\"<br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who brought death to Vyomäsura and Aghäsura.<br />\r\n<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena kaliya-damanaà kalitaà yena<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena khara-pralambaka-çamanaà yena<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Balaram;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;\r\nmso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who defeated the Käliya serpent.\"<br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who pacified Dhenukäsura and Pralambäsura.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena dava-yugmaà paripétam yena<br />\r\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena trasyati kaàçaù satataà yena<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person who swallowed two forest-fires.:<br />\r\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\r\n\"The same person whom Kaàsa always fears.:<br style=\"mso-special-character:\r\nline-break\">\r\n<br style=\"mso-special-character:line-break\">\r\n</span><!--EndFragment--></p>\r\n<p>After the procession in the temple, Sivarama Maharaja led another short procession once around Govardhana Hill here in New Vraja Dhama and led everyone to the pandal where there was a huge feast served out to all of the devotees and guests.

I will post them here and they will also be posted in the Gallery section from where I believe individual photos can also be downloaded.</p>\n<p>The morning of Govardhana Puja began with Mangal Arati, japa, then Guru Puja at 7:30 AM, the Deity Greeting began at approximately 8:15 AM and the kirtan continued right up until approximately 11:00 AM, with an abhiseka for Giriraja from about 10:00 to 11:00 AM. (The full morning kirtan will be posted soon.)</p>\n<p>After abhiseka, I then lectured until approximately 12:15 PM, at which time we all went in procession, with Govardhana Lal leading the procession on a beautiful oxcart, to the goshalla to take darshan of Krsna's cows. We also had the opportunity to hear about some of the pastimes of some particular cows in the herd, and especially to hear how important and dear to Krsna are His cows.</p>\n<p>Sivarama Maharaja then personally thanked all of the sponsors for their annual sponsorships of the cows, new sponsors came forward to sponsor some of the new cows and oxen in the herd since the previous Govardhana Puja, and after that, go-puja was performed. Then Mahaprasadam was distributed to everyone— all sweets and preparations made directly from milk offered to Radha Syamasundara by Krsna's cows and the vegetables and grains which were produced by ox-power in New Vraja Dhama.</p>\n<p>The cows were then let outside and everyone got the opportunity to feed Syamasundara's cows and the bulls fresh carrots from the garden.</p>\n<p>The procession returned to the temple room where many devotees were still stacking up heaps and heaps of bhoga which was to be offered to Radha Syamasundara and Sri Govardhana Lal— all 2,450 kilograms of it. Yes, that's right. 2,450 kilograms. This year the Hungarian devotees far exceeded their goal of 2,000 kilograms of sweets which they wanted to offer to Govardhana Lal. And even though Govardhana Lal received all that was offered, Sivarama Maharaja emphasized at the end of my class, that even if Giriraja gets 2,000 kilograms today, Giriraja will still continue to say \"Aniyora, Aniyora\". \"Give me more, Give me more!\"</p>\n<p>Kirtan went on during the offering of sweets, and then all the prasadam was removed from the temple room so that there would be enough room to circumambulate the smaller mountain of prasadam in the center of the temple room. While circumambulating Govardhana hill the devotees sang the following song sung by the residents of Vrndavana when they were circumambulating Govardhana Hill (from Gopal Campu):</p>\n\n<!--StartFragment--><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Balaram\">giri-pujeyaà vihita kena araci çakra-padam abhayaà yena<br />\ngiri-pujeyam vihita kena putanika sa nihata yena</span></p>\n<p>\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who made us free from fear of Indra.\"<br />\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who killed the Pütanä witch.\"</p>\n<p>giri-pujeyaà vihita kena tånavarta-tanu-dalanaà yena<br />\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena yamalarjuna-tarum udakali yena</p>\n<p>\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who crushed the Tåëävarta whirlwind.\"<br />\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who uprooted the yamala-arjuna trees.\"</p>\n<p>giri-pujeyaà vihita kena vatsa-bakasura-hananaà yena<br />\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena vyomaghasura-maraëaà yena<p></p></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Balaram\"><br />\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who killed Vatsäsura and Bakäsura.\"<br />\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who brought death to Vyomäsura and Aghäsura.</span></p>\n<p>giri-pujeyaà vihita kena kaliya-damanaà kalitaà yena<br />\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena khara-pralambaka-çamanaà yena<p></p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Balaram;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;&lt;br /&gt;&#10;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><br />\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who defeated the Käliya serpent.\"<br />\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who pacified Dhenukäsura and Pralambäsura.\"</span></p>\n<p>giri-pujeyaà vihita kena dava-yugmaà paripétam yena<br />\ngiri-pujeyaà vihita kena trasyati kaàçaù satataà yena</p>\n<p>\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person who swallowed two forest-fires.:<br />\n\"Who ordered the worship of Govardhana Hill?\"<br />\n\"The same person whom Kaàsa always fears.:<br style=\"mso-special-character:&lt;br /&gt;&#10;line-break\" /><br /><br style=\"mso-special-character:line-break\" /><br /></p>\n<!--EndFragment-->\n<p>After the procession in the temple, Sivarama Maharaja led another short procession once around Govardhana Hill here in New Vraja Dhama and led everyone to the pandal where there was a huge feast served out to all of the devotees and guests. As you can imagine, there were literally tons and tons of sweets to distribute, but naturally not all of the sweets were distributed at the feast.

				"value": "<p>Yesterday, on the way back to the house from taking lunch at the temple, Sivarama Swami and I were discussing about how many preparations were being offered on Govardhana Puja. Maharaja was telling me that this year the devotees are going to try to exceed 2,000 kilograms of bhoga to offer to Radha Syamasundara and Govardhana Lal. Maharaja explained that every year the devotees of New Vraja Dhama, as well as devotees visiting from other yatras in Hungary, strive to exceed 2,000 kilograms, but so far they haven't quite been able to make it to 2,000 kilograms yet. Last year about 1,900 kilograms was offered. The year before they offered about 1,950 kilograms. But they are hoping that this year they will finally offer at least 2,000 kilograms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe devotees never know how much is offered until every preparation arrives in New Vraja Dhama and is weighed (the weight of the preparation only, and not including the container) before being placed before the Deities in the temple. Usually half of the temple room floor is filled with hundreds of different preparations by the time the offering is made.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI mentioned to Sivarama Maharaja that I had given a talk in Budapest on Sunday about the importance of observing Govardhana Puja and mentioned a little about what I had spoken during the lecture. I told him that after giving that talk, I felt a very strong urge to prepare something for the pleasure of Govardhana Lal and Radha Syamasundara, but that it had been such a long time since the last time I cooked that I didn't know what to prepare.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaharaja told me that he was thinking the same way and just the day before he had sent a text message to Govinda Maharaja to ask him for his recipe for sweet rice.<span>  </span>However, as Maharaja went on to explain, he still wasn't sure if he would have time to make the preparation because of his writing schedule. So he said that if I wanted to prepare something I could prepare sweet rice according to Govinda Maharaja's recipe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI know that anything Govinda Maharaja prepares is always totally \"out of this world\". I recalled the feast that he, Radhanath Maharaja, Bhakti Vijnana Goswami Maharaja and myself had prepared in St. Petersburg on Radhastami in 1998 in a very small kitchen of a rented hall. Govinda Maharaja organized the most amazing feast I ever had, considering the facilities which were available for cooking the feast. The four of us cooked different preparations but Govinda Maharaja was the master maestro who oversaw everything and cooked more preparations than anyone else. After the offering was made and we were sampling Radharani's remnants, I had no doubt that every preparation was accepted by Radharani as a preparation fit for satisfying the senses of Syama. It was a very special feast <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving first-hand experience of Govinda Maharaja's expertise in cooking, I felt confident that if I followed his recipe that I could make something which would be offerable, at least in terms of the quality of the preparation, though I remained conscious of the fact that even the best recipe is useless unless the right consciousness is there while cooking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometime after I had taken rest last night, I was awakened by the sound of a text message coming in on my mobile phone. I didn't bother to get up, but when I woke up this morning, I read the text message. On the top of the message forwarded by Sivarama Maharaja was Sivarama Maharaja's message to Govinda Maharaja.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Give me your sweet rice recipe for making large quantity. I am thinking of doing it for Lal with cream added.\" <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGovinda Maharaja wrote back:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"15 litres of milk<br />\r\n1 kilo of rice<br />\r\n3 kilos of sugar<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBring the milk to a boil. Boil down about 10%. Add rice and boil. Cook till rice is suspended in the milk. Add sugar and cook for about 5 more minutes. Turn off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI suggest at the end adding approximately 1 litre thick cream for each 15 litres of milk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou could also boil with bay leaves and add finely powdered cardamom at the end <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOr.. take finely powdered saffron and dissolve in a small amount of hot milk and mix that in the final product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCool it under moonlight on the banks of the Jamuna and give to your Master and Mistress.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI showered, then went to the temple room and chanted all of my rounds, but before finishing my rounds I decided that I would make the sweet rice preparation before taking breakfast prasadam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI told Syama Bihari dasa of my intentions, and that I would like to start cooking immediately after the Guru Puja kirtan. The ingredients were gathered and when I went into the kitchen after the Guru Puja kirtan, the devotee in charge of all preparations for Govardhana Puja, Anuragi devi dasi, was waiting for me in the kitchen. I put on my apron and began stirring 15 litres of milk, adding about 10 bay leaves while stirring and continued to cook down the milk for about an hour and a half, being very careful to never stop stirring so that it would not burn on the bottom of the pot. I have experience from the days when I was head cook in Boston back in 1975, that once there is even the slightest burn on the bottom of the pot, then very quickly the whole preparation can be ruined. So I was very careful to never stop stirring, not even once, for the entire two hours while I cooked the sweet rice preparation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile I was stirring, I was able to listen to a class given by Urmila devi dasi over the loud speaker in the kitchen. She was speaking about engaging in service with the right consciousness. Hearing her talk while cooking was a helpful addition for making the preparation with the Lord's pleasure in mind. After the milk had cooked down, I added the rice and continued cooking, stirring continuously, for at least another half hour and then followed everything according to Govinda Maharaja's instruction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll that was left was to put the sweet rice under the moonlight on the banks of the Jamuna, and then to offer the preparation to the Master and Mistress of New Vraja Dhama tomorrow. Many of us discussed how to complete the offering in accordance with Govinda Maharaja's instruction. It was decided that for now, the preparation would be set aside in the cellar to cool down, and then we could decide later if it would be possible to set it out tonight on the banks of the Jamuna here in New Vraja Dhama. We discussed that it's risky, unless somebody sleeps next to the preparation, because you never know what creature will come and try to enjoy it before it gets offered to Their Lordships.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhether the preparation makes it to the banks of the Jamuna tonight or not, I pray that some day the Divine Couple will grant me some personal service for Them in that most sacred place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHare Krsna.</p>\r\n<p><!--StartFragment--></p>\r\n<p> </p>",

			"Body_raw": {
				"value": "<!--StartFragment-->\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Last night I arrived back in Budapest from Ukraine. Those who were at the Evpatoriya Festival know that my original plan to depart on the 14th morning was changed when one of my secretary's received a phone call from the airlines in Simferopol telling us that my flight to Kiev from Simferopol was postponed and would not arrive in Kiev in time to make my connection from Kiev to Budapest on the 14th afternoon. Moreover, there were no flights from Kiev to Budapest on the 15th. The next flight I could make to Budapest was on the 16th afternoon. So Krsna tricked me into staying 1.5 more days at the festival than originally planned. Actually, I saw it all as Krsna's arrangement. There was no other way of seeing it. I really wasn't prepared to leave on the 14th anyway, but I would have rushed to do so if Krsna didn't make this new arrangement for me. On one hand, I needed the extra time in Budapest to rest before flying to Almaty tomorrow morning. On the other hand, I was having a difficult time pulling myself away from all the devotees in attendance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Upon hearing the news of my new flight arrangements, I then decided to make the 15th my day to rest for the whole day. Madana-mohana dasa, my secretary, even suggested that I lock my door from the outside so that nobody could get in and I couldn't get out. He was concerned that I wasn't being moderate enough with my daily activities during the first two days of the festival. But no matter how hard I tried to rest on the 15th, I felt a pulling to be with devotees and I could see that ultimately Krsna gave me this extra day and a half to spend time with more devotees, both individually and collectively—especially during the evening kirtans.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Personally, I was very enlivened with this year's Evpatoriya Festival, at least with the events I was able to take part in. In years past, I always tried to visit the talks of some of the other speakers, and hear the realizations they share with those who participate in their seminars. But with my limited schedule this year, other than whatever amount of time I was able to participate in during the morning and evening programs, I was only able to attend one theater performance by the Dnipropetrovsk devotees about the influence of Kali Yuga. I was invited to attend by Dhanesvara Prabhu. I then wanted to attend the following evening's performance, which was to be about the life of Haridas Thakur. I was particularly eager to see this performance, because the devotees had put this performance together for my 2006 Vyasa Puja in Dnipropetrovsk. But because I was unable to attend, I was only able to see the performance by webcam while I was in the United States.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As it turned out, Krsna changed my plans again when the airlines called on the 15th afternoon and said that my 9:20 PM flight that evening was postponed until midnight, or possibly even to 4:00 AM the next morning. They then said it was even possible that the 4:00 AM flight could be postponed again, which meant that I could again miss my 16th afternoon flight to Budapest. They said that there was a seat available on an earlier flight, leaving at 9:00 PM. So at the last moment, I had to quickly pack, and just before I was going to the pandal for a short evening kirtan which was scheduled before leaving to the airport, I had to immediately drive to the airport instead so that I would not miss that earlier flight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It was a big disappointment for me, because I was especially enlivened to see so many devotees participating in the evening kirtans. But again, this was one of those situations which was beyond my control.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unfortunately, I also did not make it in time to see the Haridas Thakur performance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anyway, a large number of pictures were taken and collected by Mathuranath of the Evpatoriya Festival. I've decided to upload them and post them here in this blog. There are too many pictures to organize according to category, but if you look at them all, there's definitely one theme which will stand out above everything else. Everyone was experiencing spiritual enlivenment by the surcharged devotional atmosphere of the festival.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If anyone has any experiences from the festival they would like to share with the other registered users, please post them as comments to this blog.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hare Krsna.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n<p><iframe align=\"center\" src=\"http://www.flickr.com/slideShow/index.gne?group_id=&amp;user_id=38018978@N02&amp;set_id=72157622270880811&amp;text=\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"725\" height=\"725\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><br />\r\n<small>Created with <a title=\"Admarket.se\" href=\"http://www.admarket.se\">Admarket's</a> <a title=\"flickrSLiDR\" href=\"http://flickrslidr.com\">flickrSLiDR</a>.</small></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Евпаторийский фестиваль</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Вчера вечером я вернулся в Будепешт из Украины. Те, кто были на фестивале в Евпатории знают, что мой изначальный план уехать 14-го утром изменился, потому что одному из моих секретарей позвонили из авиалиний в Симферополе и сказали, что мой рейс в Киев из Симферополя перенесли вперед во времени, и что он не прилетит в Киев вовремя для того, чтобы я успел пересесть на самолет из Киева в Будапешт 14-го в полдень. Более того, на 15-е число рейса из Киева в Будапешт не было вообще. Ближайший рейс на Будапешт, которым я смог бы полететь, был 16-го в полдень. Таким образом Кришна хитростью вынудил меня остаться на фестивале на 1.5 дней больше, чем я изначально планировал. На самом деле я считаю, что все это устроил Кришна. У меня не было возможности считать по-другому. В любом случае, в действительности я не был готов уезжать 14-го, и если бы Кришна не создал эти новые обстоятельства для меня, я был бы вынужден уезжать в большой спешке. С одной стороны, мне нужно было больше времени в Будапеште, чтобы отдохнуть перед вылетом в Алматы утром на следующий день. С другой стороны, мне было непросто расставаться с преданными, которые меня ждали.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Услышав новости о моих новых изменениях в авиаперелетах, я решил сделать 15-е число тем днем, когда я смогу отдохнуть на протяжении всего дня. Мадана-мохана даса, мой секретарь, предложил даже, чтобы меня закрыли в комнате, чтобы ко мне никто не мог зайти, и я не мог бы никуда выйти.  Он беспокоился о том, что у меня не получалось следовать моему ежедневному распоряядку в достаточной степени на протяжении первых двух дней фестиваля. Однако как бы с трудом я ни старался отдохнуть 15-го числа, я чувствовал побуждение быть вместе с преданными, я видел, что в конечном итоге Кришна дал мне еще один дополнительный день с половиной, чтобы я провел время с бОльшим количеством преданных - как коллективно, так и индивидуально, в особенности во время вечерних киртанов.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Что каксается лично меня, я был очень вдохновлен Евпаторийским фестивалем в этом году, по крайней мере это касается тех событий, в которых я смог поучаствовать. В прошлые годы я всегда пытался посещать лекции и семинары других лекторов и слушать те их осознания, которыми они делились с посещавшими эти семинары. Но при моем ограниченном распорядоке дня, помимо того времени (сколько бы его ни было), когда я смог учавствовать в утренних и вечерних программах, я смог посетить всего лишь один спектакль преданных из Днепропетровска о влиянии Кали Юги. Меня пригласил на него Дханешвара пр. Помимо этого я хотел посетить вечерний спектакль о жизне Харидаса Тхакура. Я особенно хотел посмотреть именно этот спектакль потому, что преданные совместно поставили его на мою Вьяса Пуджу 2006 года в Днепропетровске.

Однако представитель авиалиний добавила, что вполне возможно что и этот рейс в 4 утра перенесут еще дальше, что означало бы, что я опять пропущу самолет в Будапешт 16-го в полдень.  Она сказала, что есть свободное место на более ранний рейс, который вылетает в 21:00. Итак, в последний момент, мне пришлось быстро собирать вещи, и прямо тогда, когда мне нужно было идти в пандал на короткий вечерний киртан, запланированный до моего отъезда в аэропорт, мне нужно было ехать в аеропорт немедленно, в противном случаем я мог бы пропустить этот более ранний рейс.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Это очень сильно расстроило меня, поскольку я получал много силы особенно тогда, когда я видел множество преданных во время вечерних киртанах.

Those who were at the Evpatoriya Festival know that my original plan to depart on the 14th morning was changed when one of my secretary's received a phone call from the airlines in Simferopol telling us that my flight to Kiev from Simferopol was postponed and would not arrive in Kiev in time to make my connection from Kiev to Budapest on the 14th afternoon. Moreover, there were no flights from Kiev to Budapest on the 15th. The next flight I could make to Budapest was on the 16th afternoon. So Krsna tricked me into staying 1.5 more days at the festival than originally planned. Actually, I saw it all as Krsna's arrangement. There was no other way of seeing it. I really wasn't prepared to leave on the 14th anyway, but I would have rushed to do so if Krsna didn't make this new arrangement for me. On one hand, I needed the extra time in Budapest to rest before flying to Almaty tomorrow morning. On the other hand, I was having a difficult time pulling myself away from all the devotees in attendance.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Upon hearing the news of my new flight arrangements, I then decided to make the 15th my day to rest for the whole day. Madana-mohana dasa, my secretary, even suggested that I lock my door from the outside so that nobody could get in and I couldn't get out. He was concerned that I wasn't being moderate enough with my daily activities during the first two days of the festival. But no matter how hard I tried to rest on the 15th, I felt a pulling to be with devotees and I could see that ultimately Krsna gave me this extra day and a half to spend time with more devotees, both individually and collectively—especially during the evening kirtans.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Personally, I was very enlivened with this year's Evpatoriya Festival, at least with the events I was able to take part in. In years past, I always tried to visit the talks of some of the other speakers, and hear the realizations they share with those who participate in their seminars. But with my limited schedule this year, other than whatever amount of time I was able to participate in during the morning and evening programs, I was only able to attend one theater performance by the Dnipropetrovsk devotees about the influence of Kali Yuga. I was invited to attend by Dhanesvara Prabhu. I then wanted to attend the following evening's performance, which was to be about the life of Haridas Thakur. I was particularly eager to see this performance, because the devotees had put this performance together for my 2006 Vyasa Puja in Dnipropetrovsk. But because I was unable to attend, I was only able to see the performance by webcam while I was in the United States.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As it turned out, Krsna changed my plans again when the airlines called on the 15th afternoon and said that my 9:20 PM flight that evening was postponed until midnight, or possibly even to 4:00 AM the next morning. They then said it was even possible that the 4:00 AM flight could be postponed again, which meant that I could again miss my 16th afternoon flight to Budapest. They said that there was a seat available on an earlier flight, leaving at 9:00 PM. So at the last moment, I had to quickly pack, and just before I was going to the pandal for a short evening kirtan which was scheduled before leaving to the airport, I had to immediately drive to the airport instead so that I would not miss that earlier flight.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It was a big disappointment for me, because I was especially enlivened to see so many devotees participating in the evening kirtans. But again, this was one of those situations which was beyond my control.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unfortunately, I also did not make it in time to see the Haridas Thakur performance.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anyway, a large number of pictures were taken and collected by Mathuranath of the Evpatoriya Festival. I've decided to upload them and post them here in this blog. There are too many pictures to organize according to category, but if you look at them all, there's definitely one theme which will stand out above everything else. Everyone was experiencing spiritual enlivenment by the surcharged devotional atmosphere of the festival.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If anyone has any experiences from the festival they would like to share with the other registered users, please post them as comments to this blog.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hare Krsna.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> <p></p></p>\n<!--EndFragment--><p>\n<iframe align=\"center\" src=\"http://www.flickr.com/slideShow/index.gne?group_id=&amp;user_id=38018978@N02&amp;set_id=72157622270880811&amp;text=\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"725\" height=\"725\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p><p>\n<small>Created with <a title=\"Admarket.se\" href=\"http://www.admarket.se\">Admarket's</a> <a title=\"flickrSLiDR\" href=\"http://flickrslidr.com\">flickrSLiDR</a>.</small></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Евпаторийский фестиваль</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Вчера вечером я вернулся в Будепешт из Украины. Те, кто были на фестивале в Евпатории знают, что мой изначальный план уехать 14-го утром изменился, потому что одному из моих секретарей позвонили из авиалиний в Симферополе и сказали, что мой рейс в Киев из Симферополя перенесли вперед во времени, и что он не прилетит в Киев вовремя для того, чтобы я успел пересесть на самолет из Киева в Будапешт 14-го в полдень. Более того, на 15-е число рейса из Киева в Будапешт не было вообще. Ближайший рейс на Будапешт, которым я смог бы полететь, был 16-го в полдень. Таким образом Кришна хитростью вынудил меня остаться на фестивале на 1.5 дней больше, чем я изначально планировал. На самом деле я считаю, что все это устроил Кришна. У меня не было возможности считать по-другому. В любом случае, в действительности я не был готов уезжать 14-го, и если бы Кришна не создал эти новые обстоятельства для меня, я был бы вынужден уезжать в большой спешке. С одной стороны, мне нужно было больше времени в Будапеште, чтобы отдохнуть перед вылетом в Алматы утром на следующий день. С другой стороны, мне было непросто расставаться с преданными, которые меня ждали.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Услышав новости о моих новых изменениях в авиаперелетах, я решил сделать 15-е число тем днем, когда я смогу отдохнуть на протяжении всего дня. Мадана-мохана даса, мой секретарь, предложил даже, чтобы меня закрыли в комнате, чтобы ко мне никто не мог зайти, и я не мог бы никуда выйти.  Он беспокоился о том, что у меня не получалось следовать моему ежедневному распоряядку в достаточной степени на протяжении первых двух дней фестиваля. Однако как бы с трудом я ни старался отдохнуть 15-го числа, я чувствовал побуждение быть вместе с преданными, я видел, что в конечном итоге Кришна дал мне еще один дополнительный день с половиной, чтобы я провел время с бОльшим количеством преданных - как коллективно, так и индивидуально, в особенности во время вечерних киртанов.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Что каксается лично меня, я был очень вдохновлен Евпаторийским фестивалем в этом году, по крайней мере это касается тех событий, в которых я смог поучаствовать. В прошлые годы я всегда пытался посещать лекции и семинары других лекторов и слушать те их осознания, которыми они делились с посещавшими эти семинары. Но при моем ограниченном распорядоке дня, помимо того времени (сколько бы его ни было), когда я смог учавствовать в утренних и вечерних программах, я смог посетить всего лишь один спектакль преданных из Днепропетровска о влиянии Кали Юги. Меня пригласил на него Дханешвара пр. Помимо этого я хотел посетить вечерний спектакль о жизне Харидаса Тхакура. Я особенно хотел посмотреть именно этот спектакль потому, что преданные совместно поставили его на мою Вьяса Пуджу 2006 года в Днепропетровске. Но поскольку я не смог приехать, мне удалось посмотреть этот спектакль через вэбкамеру, когда я был в Америке.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Как оказалось, Кришна вновь изменил мои планы - 15-го после обеда опять позвонили из авиалиний и сказали, что мой рейс в этот день в 21:20 перенесли вперед, почти на 12 часов ночи, и возможно, что даже его перенесут еще дальше - на 4 утра следующего дня.

I decided to write a blog to explain everything in advance to avoid as much confusion as possible. I realize that confusion is inevitable. Exceptions will be inevitable. And a lot of hard work and discrimination for Madana-mohana dasa, my secretary during my two days at this festival, will be inevitable. But hopefully, what I will say here will keep all of these factors down to a minimum so that it is easier for you to know what to expect of me in regard to initiations during the festival and later, and so it is easier for my current and future secretaries to know how to deal with various cases regarding initiations.</p>  <p>I believe that some information has already gone out regarding initiations. I'm not sure what that information is. I have not seen it and I do not know where it was posted, so I cannot confirm that what has been disseminated is consistent with the policies I'm hoping to enforce for initiations in Evpatoriya this year. Again, I am therefore putting it here on this website into my own words to avoid as much confusion as possible.</p>  <p>I would like to make it clear one more time that just as this website should hopefully become the most reliable source of information regarding my travel plans, I am hoping that it will become the most reliable source of information for matters concerning other plans both now and for the future.</p>  <p>The criteria, which will be forthcoming in this blog, should therefore be made as clear as possible, so forgive me if I am a little repetitive. If I decide to make any exceptions to the following criteria, it will only be based upon the verbal (in person) or written (signed) request of a the candidate's counselor, Temple President, Regional Secretary, or GBC (more details on this later).</p>  <p>It is too difficult for me to delineate all the criteria for what my secretary might consider as an exception. But some of the criteria which I used last year was 1) distance – meaning that they had already been recommended for initiation long before coming to the festival (between 2006 and 2008) and the candidate lived so far away that it was too prohibitive for them to come at another time on a possible short notice, 2) the candidate had a serious illness which was worsening and which would make it more difficult for the candidate to attend an initiation ceremony at a later date, 3) the candidate had a terminal illness, and 4) there was a extraordinary situation or oversight which the candidate's authorized counselor (criteria for an authorized counselor will be covered later in this text), Temple President, Regional Secretary, or GBC felt was a very strong reason for making the candidate's case an exception.</p>  <p>The last point (#4) is a bit more vague than the first three, but it gives the candidate's authorized representative an opportunity to at least be heard if they feel they have a strong case they wish to present for considering the candidate to qualify as an exception for this initiation. All of the above four criteria, however, will only be considered if there is an authorized written recommendation for the candidate, written prior to coming to the festival with all the authorized signatures on the recommendation. In other words, these four criteria for exceptions do not apply to somebody who comes to the festival without an authorized recommendation written between 2006 and 2009. Again, I need to repeat that this last point applies only to those falling into the category of exceptions.</p>  <p>The policy I will be requesting Madan-mohana dasa to enforce for this initiation in Evpatoriya are fully consistent with the policies I spoke about in 2008 in Moscow, Kiev, Lithuania, Minsk, and Evpatoriya. I will be performing a limited number of initiations per year, and the recommendations for initiations which will be accepted, in general, for future years (I am not speaking specifically about next week in Evpatoriya) will be based upon the length of time the candidate for initiation has been 1) chanting pranama mantra, 2) practicing the four principles and chanting 16 rounds/ day, and 3) already holding on to a recommendation for initiation.</p>  <p>The general criteria for this initiation is as follows:</p>  <p>This year in Evpatoriya the main criteria will be taken from those who already had recommendations for initiation in 2006. Any devotee who brought a recommendation for first initiation or second initiation to my 2006 Vyasa Puja, the Vyasa Puja which I was scheduled to attend in May, 2006 along with H.H. Indradyumna Swami, but just one or two days before had to cancel for reasons already known to everyone. <o:p></o:p></p>    <p>In Evpatoriya next week I will accept 25 candidates for first initiation only from those who already had recommendations for first initiation in 2006. So be sure that if you know a devotee who is in that category, that you be kind to them (since everyone may not read this posting) and tell them to bring their 2006 recommendations with them to Evpatoriya.</p>  <p>If there are more than 25 candidates for first initiation from 2006, then the 25 candidates who will be accepted for this initiation on September 13th will be those who have been practicing Krsna consciousness (following four regulative principles and chanting a minimum of 16 rounds/daily) for the longest period of time.</p>  <p>In other words, if there are more than 25 first initiation recommendations from 2006, then only the first 25 will be accepted in Evpatoriya for the September 13th initiation. Those who have not been waiting as long as the first 25 will be on the top of the list for the next initiations, tentatively planned for Vyasa Puja either in December of this year or January of next year. That Vyasa Puja is tentative only, and it will not be decided whether or not it will be held then or in May until my health situation is more clear.</p>  <p>Regarding second initiations, all those who had recommendations for second initiation in May, 2006, will be accepted as candidates for second initiation in Evpatoriya this year, providing, of course, that their recommendations are still valid <o:p></o:p></p>    <p>I wish to repeat one more time, that I am aware that some exceptions for both first and second initiation may have to be considered, but exceptions will be considered only if there is a written or verbal request made for the candidate, on behalf of the candidate, by either the candidates counselor, Temple President, Regional Secretary, or GBC. Moreover, the counselor must also have a written (signed) or verbal endorsement (a verbal endorsement means that the counselor's Temple President, Regional Secretary, or GBC, must accompany the counselor to speak with Madana-mohana dasa) from their Temple President, Regional Secretary or GBC, that they are an authorized counselor for the candidate. Once identified as an authorized counselor, the Temple President, Regional Secretary, or GBC can leave, and the counselor can present their reasons for making the exception. If a counselor comes without any one of those endorsements, his appeal will not be accepted.</p>  <p>All recommendations must be submitted no later than 6:00 PM, September 12th. Initiations will be held on the afternoon of September 13th.</p>  <p>Finally, I wish to make it clear that the 2006 candidates being considered can come from any region within the former Soviet Union or East Europe. This is not only for candidates from Ukraine.</p>  <p>Hare Krsna.  <o:p></o:p></p>  <p><!--EndFragment--></p>",

So they already knew and fully accepted that I would not speak on the subject this year or any subsequent year.[…]</p>  <p>[…]<o:p></o:p></p>  <p>I also don't remember intentionally pressuring anyone who did not wish to give donations. If I wanted to apply pressure then I would have spoken on the subject to everyone (thousands more in the main tent) during Srimad Bhagavatam class. In fact one sannyasi godbrother, when he heard about that Amrita Vani lecture, suggested that I give a similar class in the main tent and said that if I didn't that he would. But I purposely did not want to do that and I did not want him to do that because I wished to only address my disciples, those who I thought would be most inclined to assist me. I also addressed the matter during a seminar because I assumed that my seminars consisted mainly of my disciples many of whom regularly give me donations when they see me at the Ukraine Festival. Maybe you are not aware of that. But I usually get a lot of donations from disciples during the festival. At most, there were maybe 300-400 devotees present at that first lecture in comparison to the more than 4,000 who attended the whole festival.</p>  <p>Sometimes I am given quite substantial donations during the festival. So I simply decided to make it clear on the first day I spoke to those disciples who were already planning to give me donations or those who had already given me a donation that I would be using their donations to help cover the cost of the festival, because I believed in the purpose of the festival (and still do). I tried to take advantage of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's quote to firmly establish the principle upon which Krsna conscious festivals should be organized.</p>  <p>Also I must honestly tell you that the lecture was spontaneous. Even before sitting down to give the lecture, I did not even know exactly which subject I was going to speak on. I had gone through Amrita Vani and I had extracted approximately 10 quotes from which I was going to spontaneously choose to speak during the lecture. When I sat down, I chose that quote first, and what came out from me came without any previous thought or preparation. The quote just seemed so relevant, so I decided to continue on the topic.</p>  <p>Nobody, and I say this absolutely without hesitation, NOBODY asked me to give a lecture on that subject. It was totally unexpected, both to the organizers and to me. It just so happens that one of the organizers, my disciple, who attended the lecture, told me after the lecture that he cried during the lecture, because he felt so much my support from that lecture for all the sacrifices he was making in his efforts to serve all the devotees attending the festival. He told me this with tears in his eyes.</p>  <p>Anyway, none of the other two lectures I gave from Amrita Vani had any connection to that topic. It was only at the end of the other lectures, after I completely finished the lecture, that I reminded, again assuming that the seminars consisted mainly of my disciples, that those who were planning to give me a donation during the festival could do so at the end of the lecture so that I could give their donations to the festival organizers.</p>  <p>This year, if anyone gives me a donation, I have no plan to give it to the festival organizers. I always assume that if somebody gives me a donation, that they trust that I will use it in Krsna's service. There are even many times, especially when somebody gives me a big donation, out of courtesy, I will ask the person giving the donation if they have any preferences how they would like me to use their donation in Krsna's service. Last year I therefore just wanted to assure everyone that it was my conviction that supporting a festival organized on the five principles I spoke about when I quoted Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, and especially a festival organized on the basis of voluntary donations, was something I considered to be in the category of \"Krsna's service\". I therefore thought I was telling everyone in advance that that's how I would be using all donations given to me at the festival last year.</p>  <p>I do not know what kind of rumors are going around about why I am going to the festival this year. Neither do I know what kind of impressions were made in other devotees' minds from that first Amrita Vani presentation I gave in Evpatoriya last year, other than the positive things I heard after the lecture. But it is obvious from your letter, that my lectures gave you a different impression than what I had heard from others (those who heard the lecture and later spoke to me about it) and it disappointed you. I am sorry that I disappointed you with that lecture. If there is anyone else you know that was disappointed by that lecture, then I ask you to please forward this letter to them so that they may hopefully have a better understanding why I spoke as I did.</p>  <p>But as I said, there will be no such lectures this year, or in any future year.\"</p>  <p>Hare Krsna.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p><!--EndFragment-->  <!--EndFragment--></p>",

So, it's not that the desire to attend hasn't been there in my heart. If I am to honest, I must tell you that it was already there. Why? Because when I was in Kiev and when I saw how devotees felt encouraged by even the smallest exchanges, I was feeling that if it was happening in Kiev, the place that I've visited the most in Ukraine for the past few years since my health really started to deteriorarate, then I started to imagine how I might be able to encourage devotees in other cities throughout Ukraine/ Russia/ Belarus, etc. who I haven't been able to visit for at least four years. The fact is that I'm hankering to see so many devotees, just to talk with them, to say a few encouraging words to them, and to let them know that I have not forgotten them.<br /><br />On the other side, I must also be honest and confess that I am concerned that I not get overly stressed and potentially set back with my health, by having to sit in my room a lot of the time during the festival as devotees line up outside my door waiting to bring me all of their latest anxieties, doubts, complaints, and other personal problems, expecting me to make all their problems go away and to remove their anxiety, an anxiety based, in many cases, though certainly not all, upon a lack of faith in chanting Hare Krsna. Then there are the management problems which may have gotten stored up, waiting for my next visit to Ukraine. All these things are just the things that the doctor told me that I MUST stay away from for at least six months from the time of beginning my treatment (in early July) if all the herniated discs and the affected nervous system throughout my spine and the other affected areas in my body are ever going to heal.<br /><br />So, I was torn. My hope was that if my dear godbrothers, many to whom I pray every night, would attend the festival, then their presence would certainly compensate if I were to decide to not go. For valid reasons which I can and will give, gradually one godbrother after another either contacted me or I contacted them and gave me their reasons for being unable to attend the festival. My godbrothers mean so much to me, that I never wish to make them feel pressured to do something they may actually be disinclined to do because they don't want to disappoint me. I know only too well what it's like to feel pressured into doing something by someone you love because you don't want to disappoint them (sound famillar?). So when they gave me their reasons, I immediately accepted their reasons without hesitation and encouraged them to follow through with their decisions.<br /><br />Indradyumna Maharaja told me several weeks ago that he is totally exhausted from his non-stop preaching schedule. He needed to take a long break and needed to do it right after the Polish Tour. That meant that he would have to cancel his participation in the festival. He already left for Vrndavana to take that break. Bhakti Vaibhava Maharaja is on a full leave of absense for one year. I already knew that he was not going to come to the festival since early this year. Then I contacted Radhanath Maharaja, knowing full well that if he was there along with the other speakers who were still committed, devotees would feel encouraged so much by his enlivening lectures and kirtans that my presence would not be so much missed. I didn't even have to ask him if he would come to Evpatoriya. The first question he asked me when I called him (though I was calling him for other reasons as well) was, \"When is that Ukraine Festival?\" And, \"Would you and Acyuta Priya prefer me to attend the festival or to visit Kiev?\" Within days, we fixed the dates for his attending the festival, and already by that time I was thinking that I would not need to attend.<br /><br />Two weeks later, during another phone conversation with Radhanath Maharaja, he broke the news to me that he must have surgery on September 17th to have his gall bladder removed. There is a stone in his gall bladder which has the potential of causing a lot of serious problems, and after consulting several physicians, all of them wanted the stone removed surgically as soon as it would be possible. September 17th was the earliest possible date and he immediately apologized for not being able to attend the festival. Naturally I immediately accepted. But then there was still B.B, Govinda Maharaja. His tickets were already arranged and he had previously committed himself to attend. When I called Govinda Maharaja about one week ago, he unequivocally told me that he already was and will definitely be too exhausted to attend the festival. He apologized, and said that he would keep his few commitments to visit Southern Ukraine before the festival but would leave Ukraine right after that. Again, I responded that he should do whatever he felt he needed to do. The matter was finished.<br /><br />But with that last cancellation, I felt a rising need to attend the festival for at least a few days so that devotees would not feel disappointed by the lack of some of my most beloved godbrothers. Of course, there will still be many dear godbrothers attending, especially Devamrita Maharaja who always enlivens the devotees with his animated lectures and his spontaneous enthusiasm for the festival spirit in Ukraine. But I didn't want all of the pressure to pull things together to fall on him as I heard it did in a previous festival. Some other godbrothers are just not inclined to pull things together and Bhakti Vijnana Goswami has enough to deal with when the South Russia Festival appears the following week.<br /><br />Another relevant point--- Sivarama Maharaja, who all along was against my going to the festival, also seemed to understand that this last cancellation seemed like a valid reason for me to go. But it was easier for him to agree knowing that it would be only for a short visit and not for the whole festival. With his blessings. I contacted Acyuta Priya and told him that I would visit the festival, but only for a few days, and mainly for taking part in evening kirtans, the morning and evening programs, hosting the other speakers as I usually do, and for having some personal exchanges with devotees, many of whom I think about a lot but have not seen for so long. We agreed that it would be best that I not attend the whole festival. I then made my plans accordingly.<br /><br />Additionally, and perhaps this is just as important as my previous points, I felt a great desire to invite my doctor, Yasomati-nandana dasa, to travel together with me to Ukraine and back to Budapest from the festival, and to be my invited guest for the entire festival so that we could stay next to each other at the festival site and spend time together during the festival. He is a very senior devotee, in fact, he is one of the very first Hungarian devotees who started Krsna consciousness in Hungary during Communist times. He later became a doctor. He is very caring, very personal, and is just a very wonderful person. Whenever we would meet, I sensed, and he even once mentioned to me in a letter, that he was hankering to associate with devotees outside of the doctor/ patient role, and to spend time together discussing spiritual topics. I had even previously suggested that some day we should go on a \"spiritual retreat\" together, although at the time I made that offer, I had no idea what that spiritual retreat would be. The night before last, he drove from Budapest to the farm to treat me and it was at that time that I invited him to be my personal guest at the Ukraine Festival.<br /><br />The first thing he asked was how much would I be involved. I could see that he was concerned that I would not overburden myself. I assured him that it would be a festival, a spiritual retreat, and I then described what the Ukraine Festival is traditionally like. Ordinarily it is very difficult for him to get away. He manages two clinics, has 60 employees, sees patients daily, and attends medical conferences in many cities throughout the world. But I could see that he was very moved by my invitation. He said that he had to think about it for one day, because he would have to make some schedule changes, and told me that he would get back to me by last night. Last evening he called and said that he changed his schedule, and that if I could arrange tickets for him in such a way that we could fly together and he could be back by the 14th, he would be very happy to accompany me to the Ukraine Festival. I sensed that this is the kind of thing he was wanting. First thing this morning, I started working on confirming his tickets with the devotees in Ukraine, I arranged for a room next to me in Evpatoriya, and made all the other arrangements so that he would have a comfortable journey and so that we would be together as much as possible throughout the whole journey. All the arrangements are already made and confirmed. So even my doctor will be with me throughout the entire journey to Evpatoriya. You can be sure that he will watch over me and will make sure that I don't do anything which could possibly reverse all the hard work that he has done up until now. And last, but not least, he was not against the idea of me making the trip from a medical point of view.<br /><br />So that's pretty much the picture as it stands now. I am planning to attend the festival from the 12th morning until the 14th morning and will return according to the schedule which was posted on my website.<br /><br />One last point I wish to add, though this should already be clear by the above explanation. Nobody has pressured me to attend the festival because the other speakers did not attend. I am attending of my own choice for the reasons already given above. I'm saying this because I've heard some strange rumor, though I realize that the existence of the rumor may not be true, that I'm now being forced to attend by the festival organizers because some of the godbrothers who cancelled, did so because they were not happy that the festival was organized in such a way that their tickets were not being paid for by the festival committee. This is simply not true. I've previously discussed this point with many guest speakers, including with some of those mentioned above who cancelled. Moreover as you have read above, for each and every participant who cancelled, this factor had nothing to do with their reasons for cancelling. Additionally, earlier this year I had spoken personally with some of the same participants about the issue concerning their tickets and they confirmed to that they were fully satisfied with the way things were being arranged  (and they were by no means forced, or pressured, to say this to me so as to not disappoint me). Of course, you may know nothing about this point, and it may not be relevant to you, but I thought I should just mention it in case this alleged rumor did get to you.<br /><br />Again, thank you for your concern, for your love, for your dedication, and for your desire to serve. Because of the love and concern you've expressed in your letter, I pray that my answers have not disappointed you.<br /><br />Hoping this meets you in good health.<br /><br />Your well-wisher,<br />Niranjana Swami\"</p>",

So, it's not that the desire to attend hasn't been there in my heart. If I am to honest, I must tell you that it was already there. Why? Because when I was in Kiev and when I saw how devotees felt encouraged by even the smallest exchanges, I was feeling that if it was happening in Kiev, the place that I've visited the most in Ukraine for the past few years since my health really started to deteriorarate, then I started to imagine how I might be able to encourage devotees in other cities throughout Ukraine/ Russia/ Belarus, etc. who I haven't been able to visit for at least four years. The fact is that I'm hankering to see so many devotees, just to talk with them, to say a few encouraging words to them, and to let them know that I have not forgotten them.</p>\n<p>On the other side, I must also be honest and confess that I am concerned that I not get overly stressed and potentially set back with my health, by having to sit in my room a lot of the time during the festival as devotees line up outside my door waiting to bring me all of their latest anxieties, doubts, complaints, and other personal problems, expecting me to make all their problems go away and to remove their anxiety, an anxiety based, in many cases, though certainly not all, upon a lack of faith in chanting Hare Krsna. Then there are the management problems which may have gotten stored up, waiting for my next visit to Ukraine. All these things are just the things that the doctor told me that I MUST stay away from for at least six months from the time of beginning my treatment (in early July) if all the herniated discs and the affected nervous system throughout my spine and the other affected areas in my body are ever going to heal.</p>\n<p>So, I was torn. My hope was that if my dear godbrothers, many to whom I pray every night, would attend the festival, then their presence would certainly compensate if I were to decide to not go. For valid reasons which I can and will give, gradually one godbrother after another either contacted me or I contacted them and gave me their reasons for being unable to attend the festival. My godbrothers mean so much to me, that I never wish to make them feel pressured to do something they may actually be disinclined to do because they don't want to disappoint me. I know only too well what it's like to feel pressured into doing something by someone you love because you don't want to disappoint them (sound famillar?). So when they gave me their reasons, I immediately accepted their reasons without hesitation and encouraged them to follow through with their decisions.</p>\n<p>Indradyumna Maharaja told me several weeks ago that he is totally exhausted from his non-stop preaching schedule. He needed to take a long break and needed to do it right after the Polish Tour. That meant that he would have to cancel his participation in the festival. He already left for Vrndavana to take that break. Bhakti Vaibhava Maharaja is on a full leave of absense for one year. I already knew that he was not going to come to the festival since early this year. Then I contacted Radhanath Maharaja, knowing full well that if he was there along with the other speakers who were still committed, devotees would feel encouraged so much by his enlivening lectures and kirtans that my presence would not be so much missed. I didn't even have to ask him if he would come to Evpatoriya. The first question he asked me when I called him (though I was calling him for other reasons as well) was, \"When is that Ukraine Festival?\" And, \"Would you and Acyuta Priya prefer me to attend the festival or to visit Kiev?\" Within days, we fixed the dates for his attending the festival, and already by that time I was thinking that I would not need to attend.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, during another phone conversation with Radhanath Maharaja, he broke the news to me that he must have surgery on September 17th to have his gall bladder removed.

				"value": "<!--StartFragment--> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Website Administrator, Gangambupada dasa, will be upgrading this site this upcoming weekend, August 21-23, 2009, beginning Friday evening, Eastern Standard Time. As I have been told, the procedure could take even a little longer than that, although we hope that the weekend should be sufficient. There are still many more files from Janmastami which are yet to be posted.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the weekend and practically the whole time he will be performing the upgrade, the site will be up and running. You should be able to access all the existing audio files, blogs, and probably most all other resources, although I believe most video files are not being displayed right now because of a different upgrade glitch from a few days ago. Hopefully this will be repaired when the new upgrade is completed.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, until the upgrade is complete (at which time you will be notified in a new blog) there will be the following restrictions:</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">1) Nothing new can be posted. This means that there will be no new blogs, no new audio files, no new video files, no new photos, no news posted on the front page, etc.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">2) No comments can be posted.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would like to take this opportunity to encourage the site members to use this time, while the upgrading is being done, to possibly explore the site more than they have explored in the past and to see more of what is available for downloading and listening online. There are hundreds of audio files which you can scroll through beginning from the front page and thousands of photos in the photo gallery.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is not clear to me if the Fileshare section will be functioning during the upgrade. If it will be functioning, users should know that there are thousands of lectures, videos, and other materials for downloading, in the fileshare section of the site. Originally, this site was intended as a &quot;Fileshare&quot; site created primarily for that purpose&mdash;sharing files for downloading.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kanjalocana dasa spent many long hours uploading the entire NRS audio and tape ministry in order to make these files available for immediate access to any registered user.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">But, again, it's possible that the Fileshare section may not function consistently during the upgrade. If not, still there will be hundreds of files available for downloading, for listening online, and for viewing, for those who wish to explore.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hare Krsna.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><!--StartFragment--></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><!--StartFragment--></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\">Администратор вебсайта, Гангамбупада даса, будет совершенствовать этот сайт в ближайшие выходные, 21-23 августа 2009, начиная с вечера в пятницу, по восточному стандартному времени. Как я уже говорил, процедура может занять немного больше времени, хотя мы надеемся, что выходных будет достаточно. Есть еще много файлов с Джанмаштами, которые все будут помещены на сайте.<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\">Практически всё время на выходных он будет заниматься модернизацией сайта, но при этом сайт будет работать. Вы сможете иметь доступ ко всем существующим аудиофайлам, блогам, и возможно и ко всем другим ресурсам, хотя думаю, что большинство видеофайлов в данный момент не будут открываться из-за другой проблемы, связанной с модернизацией, проводившейся несколько дней назад. Надеюсь, что это будет исправлено, когда закончится новая модернизация сайта. Но всё же, пока модернизация не завершена (о чем будет извещено в новом блоге), будут следующие ограничения:<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\">1) Невозможно будет поместить что-то новое.

Есть сотни аудиофайлов, перечень которых начинается на первой странице, и есть тысячи фотографий в фотогалерее.<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\">Для меня неясно, будет ли функционировать во время модернизации в секции </span><span style=\"color:black;\r\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US\">Fileshare</span><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\">. Если это не будет работать, пользователи должны знать, что на сайте в секции </span><span style=\"color:black;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">Fileshare</span><span style=\"color:black\"> <span lang=\"RU\">есть тысячи лекций, видео и других материалов, предназначенных для скачивания.

As I have been told, the procedure could take even a little longer than that, although we hope that the weekend should be sufficient. There are still many more files from Janmastami which are yet to be posted.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the weekend and practically the whole time he will be performing the upgrade, the site will be up and running. You should be able to access all the existing audio files, blogs, and probably most all other resources, although I believe most video files are not being displayed right now because of a different upgrade glitch from a few days ago. Hopefully this will be repaired when the new upgrade is completed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, until the upgrade is complete (at which time you will be notified in a new blog) there will be the following restrictions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1) Nothing new can be posted. This means that there will be no new blogs, no new audio files, no new video files, no new photos, no news posted on the front page, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2) No comments can be posted.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I would like to take this opportunity to encourage the site members to use this time, while the upgrading is being done, to possibly explore the site more than they have explored in the past and to see more of what is available for downloading and listening online. There are hundreds of audio files which you can scroll through beginning from the front page and thousands of photos in the photo gallery.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is not clear to me if the Fileshare section will be functioning during the upgrade. If it will be functioning, users should know that there are thousands of lectures, videos, and other materials for downloading, in the fileshare section of the site. Originally, this site was intended as a \"Fileshare\" site created primarily for that purpose—sharing files for downloading.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kanjalocana dasa spent many long hours uploading the entire NRS audio and tape ministry in order to make these files available for immediate access to any registered user.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But, again, it's possible that the Fileshare section may not function consistently during the upgrade. If not, still there will be hundreds of files available for downloading, for listening online, and for viewing, for those who wish to explore.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hare Krsna.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<!--StartFragment--></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<!--StartFragment--></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\" xml:lang=\"RU\">Администратор вебсайта, Гангамбупада даса, будет совершенствовать этот сайт в ближайшие выходные, 21-23 августа 2009, начиная с вечера в пятницу, по восточному стандартному времени. Как я уже говорил, процедура может занять немного больше времени, хотя мы надеемся, что выходных будет достаточно. Есть еще много файлов с Джанмаштами, которые все будут помещены на сайте.<p></p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\" xml:lang=\"RU\">Практически всё время на выходных он будет заниматься модернизацией сайта, но при этом сайт будет работать. Вы сможете иметь доступ ко всем существующим аудиофайлам, блогам, и возможно и ко всем другим ресурсам, хотя думаю, что большинство видеофайлов в данный момент не будут открываться из-за другой проблемы, связанной с модернизацией, проводившейся несколько дней назад. Надеюсь, что это будет исправлено, когда закончится новая модернизация сайта. Но всё же, пока модернизация не завершена (о чем будет извещено в новом блоге), будут следующие ограничения:<p></p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\" xml:lang=\"RU\">1) Невозможно будет поместить что-то новое. Это значит, что не будет ни новых сообщений, ни новых аудиофайлов, ни новых видеофайлов, ни новых фотографий, ни новостей на первой страничке и т.д.<p></p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\" xml:lang=\"RU\">2) Невозможно будет поместить никаких комментарии. <p></p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\" xml:lang=\"RU\">Я бы хотел воспользоваться этой возможностью и вдохновить членов сайта использовать это время, пока идёт модернизация, и открыть для себя сайт более чем они его уже знают, и больше увидеть из того, что доступно для слушания и скачивания в онлайне. Есть сотни аудиофайлов, перечень которых начинается на первой странице, и есть тысячи фотографий в фотогалерее.<p></p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\" xml:lang=\"RU\">Для меня неясно, будет ли функционировать во время модернизации в секции </span><span style=\"color:black;&lt;br /&gt;&#10;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">Fileshare</span><span lang=\"RU\" style=\"color:black\" xml:lang=\"RU\">.

				"value": "<!--StartFragment-->\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There's been a lot going on during the past several days, making it hard for me to contribute a blog for the site.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I've had several long telephone calls these past few days, many with devotees in the United States, but also calls with Radhanath Maharaja, which included a report of the dynamic preaching that is going on in New York, and yesterday a call with Devamrita Maharja who was giving me a little report on his preaching tour in Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The day before yesterday I relocated from Budapest to New Vraja Dhama. My friend Chandramauli Maharaja was already here when we arrived, with plans to stay in New Vraja Dhama through Janmastami and Vyasa Puja. So we've been spending some time in each other's association.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Also Kesava Bharati das Goswami, with whom I have a very close friendship, arrived in Hungary on the August 10th. Acyuta dasa from East Hartford, USA arrived on August 11th to assist Kesava Bharati Maharaja and Sivarama Maharaja with the editing work on \"Nava Vraja Mahima.\" The plan is that Acyuta will stay in New Vraja Dhama and will work as a part of the editorial staff until at least April of next year. Editing this book will be his full-time engagement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yesterday, there was a meeting with Sivarama Swami, Kesava Bharati Maharaja and Acyuta dasa, to discuss how to proceed with the editing, and especially how the three of them will be working together during the upcoming full, one month-long \"marathon\" on writing and editing. Sivarama Maharaja also asked if I would participate in yesterday's meeting since Acyuta dasa is my disciple and Maharaja thought it would be good if I was present for the discussion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Acyuta came with a lot of \"goodies\" from Hartford. Jivanausadhi devi dasi, the wife of my very dear godbrother and friend, Pyari Mohan Prabhu, knows how much I like her cooking. As far as I'm concerned, she's \"One of the best- if not THE best cook I know!\". So she sent some sweets and other home-made delicacies along with many other items I asked Acyuta to bring for me from East Hartford. East Hartford is my base in the United States. So some of my personal items are stored there. I was supposed to be there in the early spring and was going to pick these things up then, but Krsna had other plans for me.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I received a beautiful \"Get Well Soon\" card from the devotees of the East Hartford Temple Community except that there was a slight re-wording of the traditional \"Get Well Soon\" in this card. Instead I found the words, \"Get Well Now!.\" I'm taking their words to heart and will try my best to at least fulfill my part of the responsibility. The card was so beautifully made that I couldn't resist taking some pictures of it (even the envelope was remarkable). On the front of the card is a picture of the presiding Deities of East Hartford ISKCON, Sri Sri Gaura Nitai, and Lord Jagannath, Lord Baladeva and Subhadra. The Hare Krsna Mahamantra was beautifully written in Sanskrit on the back of the card, and upon opening the card I found the first verse of Siksastakam beautifully printed with such delicate handwriting. Also, while opening the card, the \"white lotus\" of good fortune or \"auspiciousness\" opened out three-dimensionally from the center-fold of the card.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I was told by Acyuta dasa that the card was made by Jivanausadhi devi dasi and Bhaktin Jen. My thanks to both of them for the beautiful card and for sending their good wishes and especially for sending the good wishes from all the wonderful devotees of East Hartford ISKCON. I miss them all.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Devotees here in New Vraja Dhama are busily preparing for tomorrow's Janmastami celebrations. There can be no question in the mind of any visitor to New Vraja Dhama for Whom all the center of sacrifices are in this community. Today I asked a few pujaris how many preparations they were making for Sri Sri Radha Syamasundara. They told me that they were making three hundred preparations! Astonished, I said that they must have already started cooking some of them. The answer I got was, \"Oh yes. We started three days ago!\" And when I walked out to the flower tent where all the garlands and decorations were being put together for Their Lordships pleasure, I was also amazed by the quantity of flowers, all grown here in New Vraja Dhama, which were being carefully crafted into the most beautiful decorations. All of them will ornament both the altar and temple room by tomorrow morning.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After lunch I handed my camera to Acyuta dasa and asked him to go and take some pictures of some of the preparations which were being made for tomorrow. He managed to take some pictures, but shortly thereafter sorrowfully returned and said that because it was just after lunch, much of the busy crowd who filled both the kitchen, the vegetable-cutting area, and the flower preparation tent before lunch had dispersed for a short rest before returning to their duties a little later this afternoon. Still, we will see quite a few of the stalwarts in the pictures, who stayed on to continue their work after lunch.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If I don't get a chance to write any more for a few days, let me wish everyone a happy Janmastami tomorrow (at least it's tomorrow, August 14th, here). May your minds be fully immersed on the most auspicious advent and pastimes of our worshipful Lord Sri Krsna on this most auspicious day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hare Krsna.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">[After beginning the slideshow, click on the box on the bottom, right-hand corner with the four arrows to enter full-screen mode.
