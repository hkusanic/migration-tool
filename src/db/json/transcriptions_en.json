Beautifying these waters are the lotus flowers of singing, dancing and loud chanting of Krsna's holy name, which are the pleasure abodes of unalloyed devotees. These devotees are compared to swans, ducks and bees. The river's flowing produces a melodious sound that gladdens their ears.\n\n\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\n\n\n\tOur tongues always engage in vibrating useless sounds that do not help us realize transcendental peace. The tongue is compared to a desert because a desert needs a constant supply of refreshing water to make it fertile and fruitful. Water is the substance most needed in the desert. The transient pleasure derived from mundane topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, dry philosophy, poetry and so on is compared to a mere drop of water because although such topics have a qualitative feature of transcendental pleasure, they are saturated with the modes of material nature. Therefore neither collectively nor individually can they satisfy the vast requirements of the desertlike tongue. Despite crying in various conferences, therefore, the desertlike tongue continues to be parched. For this reason, people from all parts of the world must call for the devotees of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who are compared to swans swimming around the beautiful lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu or bees humming around His lotus feet in transcendental pleasure, searching for honey. The dryness of material happiness cannot be moistened by so-called philosophers who cry for Brahman, liberation and similar dry speculative objects. The urge of the soul proper is different. The soul can be solaced only by the mercy of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His many bona fide devotees, who never leave the lotus feet of the Lord to become imitation Mahaprabhus but all cling to His lotus feet like bees that never leave a honey-soaked lotus flower.\n\n\n\tLord Caitanya's movement of Krsna consciousness is full of dancing and singing about the pastimes of Lord Krsna. It is compared herein to the pure waters of the Ganges, which are full of lotus flowers. The enjoyers of these lotus flowers are the pure devotees, who are like bees and swans. They chant like the flowing of the Ganges, the river of the celestial kingdom. The author desires such sweetly flowing waves to cover his tongue. He humbly compares himself to materialistic persons who always engage in dry talk from which they derive no satisfaction. If they were to use their dry tongues to chant the holy name of the Lord-Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare-as exemplified by Lord Caitanya, they would taste sweet nectar and enjoy life.\n\n\n\tPURPORT by Niranjana Swami\n\n\n\tThis is a very beautiful verse composed by Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Goswami. He is using graphic metaphors to describe the characteristics of the Lord\u2019s pastimes and the devotees who relish hearing and chanting about the Lord's pastimes. He compares the transcendental activities of the Lord to be like the nectarean Ganges water which continuously flows.\n\n\n\tOut of humility Krsnadasa Kaviraja Goswami says that his own tongue is like a desert. In a desert, drinking a few drops of water is not very beneficial. In the desert one requires large quantities of water in order to satisfy one\u2019s need. Therefore he also uses this metaphor about his tongue to help us understand the necessity to take advantage of the continuous flow of the Ganges which is compared to the method for hearing the pastimes of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Another metaphor he uses is that this river is beautified by the presence of many lotus flowers, which are compared to singing, dancing, and loud chanting of Krishna's holy names. These are ornaments that make the river even more attractive. And these ornaments are the pleasure abodes for devotees. The devotees are compared to be like ducks, swans and bees.\n\n\n\tIn many places ducks and swans are compared to be like the beautiful ornaments on the body of water. They are often contrasted to crows who go to places much different than pleasure abodes. The bees are compared to those persons who are always very eager to drink the nectar of honey from the lotus feet of the Lord.\n\n\n\tTherefore the devotees are described as persons who take shelter of these pleasure abodes, these ornamental places on the river and make them even more beautiful, because wherever these lotus flowers are, the devotees are also there very eager to drink the nectar of singing, dancing and loud chanting of the glories of the Lord.\n\n\n\tThen Kaviraja Goswami uses another metaphor. The \"flowing of this river produces a beautiful sound that gladdens the ears,\" Such a transcendental sound vibration goes into the ear and enters into the heart. Lord Kapiladeva explains in His instruction to His mother, that by hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in the association of devotees they enter into the ear and go into the heart. When one advances along the path of devotional service by the continuous hearing of these nectarean pastimes and gradually he loses his taste for dry topics. He loses his attraction to those things that have no connection to Krsna and becomes attached to Krsna and then, sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati (SB 3.25.25), pure devotional service begins to awaken in his heart.\n\n\n\tIn this verse Kaviraja Goswami created this metaphor which describes the whole process of devotional service, which ultimately gives satisfaction to the thirsty soul who is hankering for more than just a few drops of water in the desert.\n\n\n\tIn contrast, Srila Prabhupada explains that the transient pleasure which is derived from mundane topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, dry philosophy, poetry and so on are compared to be like a drop of water in the desert. They cannot satisfy the need of the desert-like tongue, just as a few drops of water cannot satisfy the need of a person who requires large quantities of water to revive his health and his well-being.\n\n\n\tTherefore Kaviraja Goswami here emphasizes that one has to hear the nectarean pastimes of Lord Caitanya . \"The nectarean Ganges of the water, of transcendental activities flows on the surface of my desertlike tongue.\"\n\n\n\tThere\u2019s a very important pastime of Lord Caitanya in this connection. Hearing this pastime of the Lord is for our benefit \u2013 for both the audience and for the speaker. Although such pastimes are compared to the flowing of the Ganges, I am not sure I can make them flow nicely enough to alleviate the needs of my own desert-like tongue and of anyone else who may require a large quantity of water. Nonetheless this pastime is very relishable.\n\n\n\tThis pastime takes place over a span of different occasions, but it begins with Lord Caitanya's Mahaprakasa-lila as described in Caitanya Bhagavat. Lord Caitanya was very eager to bestow benedictions upon His devotees during this lila, otherwise known as His sata-prahariya-bhava, or the ecstasy of twenty-one hours.\n\n\n\tDuring this particular time, the Lord changed His disposition towards His devotees. Although He descended to assume the role of a devotee, during His ecstasy of twenty-one hours, He assumed the position of the Supreme Lord. In order to reciprocate with His devotees, He stood upon the altar and one by one called His devotees before Him and requested them to ask Him for a benediction. In this way the devotees who were hankering so much to experience the Lord in their presence were given that opportunity.\n\n\n\tThe Lord was also very eager to satisfy the innermost desires within the hearts of His devotees by giving them benedictions that were very pleasing to them. He called each devotee individually and revealed to each and every one of them how He had previously manifested Himself to them before He had even appeared in this world. The devotees could then understand that only the Lord could reveal something like that to them.\n\n\n\tOne by one the Lord called His devotees who all appeared in this world before Him. To each and every devotee He described how He had previously manifested Himself to them.\n\n\n\tHe called Haridasa Thakura and told him that when he was being beaten through twenty-two market places, Lord Caitanya\u00a0 personally came to protect him. The reason why he didn\u2019t feel any pain is because Lord Caitanya\u00a0 personally laid on his back and accepted the blows Himself.\n\n\n\tHe called Gangadas and said, \"Do you remember when you were fleeing out of fear of the attack of the Muslims? You and your family went to the Ganges and thought, 'How will it be possible to cross?' Do you remember that all of a sudden there was a boatman who came and asked you to come into the boat and then carried you across the water?\" Gangadas was shocked, thinking \"How did He know that a boatman came?\" \"I was that boatman\", Lord Caitanya declared. Gangadas was overwhelmed with ecstasy.\n\n\n\tOne by one He called His devotees and spoke in this way. When He called Srivasa He asked, \"Srivasa, do you remember that time when you were walking along and heard one person, Devananda Pandit reciting Srimad Bhagavatam? Because of your desire to relish Srimad Bhagavatam, knowing that every syllable of Srimad Bhagavatam is pure ecstatic love for the Lord, you entered that place to hear Srimad Bhagavatam from him. You sat and listened to Srimad Bhagavatam from Devananda realizing the full meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam and you began manifesting ecstatic symptoms of love. But this Devananda was a dry speculative philosopher. Although he was speaking from Srimad Bhagavatam, he never mentioned anything about pure devotional service.\"\n\n\n\tDevananda Pandit was known by everyone as such a knowledgeable speaker of Bhagavatam. His students would come every day and hear him speak, but it was simply dry philosophy. Although he was austere and knowledgeable and all his students would come and listen attentively to everything he had to say, he was not glorifying pure devotional service. He could not glorify pure devotional service due to some offence he had previously committed, and therefore his students also did not know the glories of pure devotional service.\n\n\n\t\"Do you remember what happened? When his students saw you manifesting ecstatic symptoms, they thought you were a disturbance to Devananda's recitation. They could not appreciate your pure devotion because none of them knew anything about it. They never heard about pure devotion before. Neither did Devananda Pandit ever speak about it.\"\n\n\n\t\"Thinking that it was more important to hear from Devananda Pandit, they picked you up and carried you outside. Do you remember how you felt? You went home, sat there and began reading Srimad Bhagavatam. While reading Srimad Bhagavatam tears of ecstasy began flowing from your eyes. Do you know why you felt this way? Because while you were reading Srimad Bhagavatam, I entered your heart. Because I entered your heart, you experienced such ecstatic love that you had never experienced before. Do you remember when that took place, Srivasa?\" Of course, Srivasa remembered and understood that the Lord was so kind.\n\n\n\tIn this connection, I would like to read one verse Vrndavana das Thakur wrote within the context of this pastime and a small but very relevant commentary from Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura.\n\n\n\t\"Devananda did not stop them. As the guru was ignorant, so were his disciples.\"\n\n\n\t[Commentary]\n\n\n\tSince the students under the shelter of Devananda, their teacher, could not understand the fruits of Srivasa's devotional service, they committed offenses at the feet of Srivasa because they were controlled by their material perception. Because the teacher, Devananda, did not check the actions of his ignorant students, he was also guilty of the offense. Devananda, who was ignorant of devotional service, gave no information about the exalted position of devotional service in his teachings to his students. Therefore since the guru had no qualification in devotional service, his disciples were also devoid of devotional service.\n\n\n\tUpon seeing the merciful pure devotees' method of preaching through chanting, many people nowadays say that it is better to worship the Lord at home in solitude. They say various obstacles such as false ego and pride attack one who preaches through chanting. But in this instance, if a person like Devananda Pandita remains ignorant about devotional service and does not preach the glories of devotional service, he commits an offense. This is the purport of this pastime. A scarcity of devotional service is seen in every activity of this world, but if one does not engage in glorifying the Lord to remove that scarcity, he is touched by offense.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami: Very powerful words from the Acharya. He says that there\u2019s a scarcity of glorification of pure devotional service and it\u2019s seen in every activity of this world. If one does not glorify pure devotional service to remove that scarcity, he is influenced by that offence.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada also described in the purport to today\u2019s verse that the soul is hankering, the tongue and ears are hankering, for the flowing river of nectar. In the desert a few drops of water, compared to the topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, etc., cannot satisfy the needs of the soul. The soul cannot be satisfied by a few drops. It needs relief from a flowing river.\n\tIn the Fourth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam Narada Muni states:\n\n\n\t\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and thus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant flow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- namely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" (SB 4.29.39-40)\n\n\n\tThat\u2019s what the living entity needs. He needs to transcend the bodily concept of life. The way to transcend the bodily concept of life is to hear the glories of pure devotional service.\n\tIn the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam it is stated:\n\n\n\t\"Pure devotional service rendered to the Supreme Lord is spiritually so potent that simply by hearing about such transcendental service, by chanting its glories in response, by meditating on it, by respectfully and faithfully accepting it, or by praising the devotional service of others, even persons who hate the demigods and all other living beings can be immediately purified.\" (SB 11.2.12)\n\n\n\tThat is the power of hearing about pure devotional service and Devananda suffered because he never spoke about pure devotional service even though he read Srimad Bhagavatam and spoke from it every single day. Lord Caitanya knew that.\n\n\n\tSome time later, when Lord Caitanya was wandering through Navadvipa, He walked by Devananda Pandit\u2019s asrama. He remembered what goes on there and what happened to Srivasa. He said, \"In there is a person who never glorifies pure devotional service. He doesn\u2019t know the glories of Srimad Bhagavatam. Srimad Bhagavatam is pure nectar. The four Vedas are like yoghurt and Srimad Bhagavatam is like butter. Sukadeva Goswami churned this yoghurt into butter and Pariksit Maharaja relished it. But this rascal thinks he speaks from Bhagavatam!\" The Lord became very, very angry. He wanted to run in there and rip up Bhagavatam but the devotees stopped Him. \"No, no, please, don\u2019t do that.\" The devotees were relishing seeing His anger but they had to stop Him. They didn\u2019t want Him to go that far.\n\n\n\tOne time again when Lord Caitanya was wandering through Navadvipa, along with Srivasa, He saw Devananda walking and approached him. He had really some strong words to say to him. He said, \"Devananda, you are a rascal! You speak from Srimad Bhagavatam but you never glorify pure devotional service. Do you know that Srivasa Thakura came into your assembly? Srivasa Thakura is such a pure devotee who relishes the topics of pure devotional service that even the Ganges descends from the spiritual world to take his darshan. And you didn\u2019t say anything when your students removed him from your presence.\" Lord Caitanya chastised him.\n\n\n\tThe important point, however, is that Devananda Pandit listened. He got some mercy, went home and thought about it. While he was thinking, he was feeling very distressed. Vrindavana das Thakura said that the reason why he was so distressed was due to his bad association.\n\n\n\tWho was that bad association? In his commentary, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura explains that his bad association were his students. They had no interest in hearing about pure devotional service, because Devananda Pandit never spoke to them about it. Hence they were all materialistic and also the cause of his own distress.\n\n\n\tStill, there\u2019s a wonderful ending to this pastime. Devananda accepted this chastisement though it still took him time to fully digest it. He then received the mercy of a great devotee.\n\n\n\tAfter Lord Caitanya took sannyasa, Vakresvara Pandit came to Devananda\u2019s asrama. Vakresvara Pandit was like one of the swans, bees, or ducks who relishes the loud kirtan, singing and dancing the Holy name of the Lord. The word used here is utkirtana, loud chanting \u2013 he was always absorbed in loud chanting, singing and dancing.\n\n\n\tDevananda Pandit became very attracted to Vakresvara Pandit and began thinking of ways he could render service to him. But because Vakresvara Pandit was always so absorbed, there was no way how he could ask him, \"What can I do to serve you?\" Devananda noticed that in his ecstasy, Vakresvara Pandit sometimes would fall to the ground. Devananda Pandit would be there to catch him whenever he would fall. He would stand around, watch and guard him very carefully. One time when Vakresvara Pandit was falling, Devananda Pandit was there to catch him, took the dust off Vakresvara Pandit's body and began smearing it on his own body. By rendering service to this devotee he finally began to understand the glories of Lord Caitanya.\n\n\n\tPreviously, although Devananda Pandit saw Lord Caitanya he didn\u2019t recognize the Lord's glories. But now having seen and having served this devotee, he was able to understand the glories of Lord Caitanya.\n\n\n\tIn this connection Vrindavana das Thakura quotes one verse:\n\n\n\t\"There may be a doubt whether the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will attain perfection, but there is absolutely no doubt that those who are attached to serving the Lord's devotees will attain perfection.\" (Govinda-bhasya, 3.3.51)\n\n\n\tAs a result of the service he rendered to Vakresvara Pandit, Devananda Pandit was able to get the mercy of Lord Caitanya.\n\n\n\tThe next time he saw Lord Caitanya was in Kuliya. He approached Him and begged the Lord for His forgiveness. He said, \"I am a fool. Previously everyone thought I was knowledgeable. I would speak from Srimad Bhagavatam. But I don\u2019t know anything about Srimad Bhagavatam. Please instruct me how I should speak from Bhagavatam.\" Lord Caitanya instructed, \"Srimad Bhagavatam, at the beginning, middle, end \u2013 any way you open it up, only glorifies pure devotional service. Never speak about anything else but pure devotional service. And then you can speak from Srimad Bhagavatam.\"\n\n\n\tWe understand from this pastime, which is like a nectar-flowing river, the significance of hearing and relishing the topics about the Lord and His pure devotees. Even though we may not fully understand them, even though we may not be able to fully comprehend the mercy of the Lord and His kindness to His devotees, and even though we may not be pure, if we hear about pure devotional service, speak about it, remember it, meditate on it, if we are respectful towards devotional service and praise the devotional service rendered by others, our hearts will become pure.\n\n\n\tThis is the greatest need for the hankering soul. None of the other topics Srila Prabhupada mentioned in his purport today [art, culture, sociology, etc.] can fulfill the need of the soul. Having once heard and understood the nature of such transcendental topics, one should be very careful. One who knows what pure devotional service is and how the glorification of pure devotional service can serve the needs of everyone, should not neglectful, and therefore touched by the offense of not removing the scarcity of pure devotional service.\n\n\n\tHare Krsna. Jaya Prabhupada!\n\n","nid":"20712"},{

Since we are beginning Kartika, I thought it would be appropriate to read a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, 10th Canto, Chapter 9, entitled \"Mother Yasoda binds Lord Krishna.\" This month is also known as the month of Damodara and is therefore a good opportunity to meditate on Damodara-lila. This very wonderful pastime displays the potency of mother Yasoda\u2019s pure love for her son.\n\n\n\tKrishna is known by His quality of being controlled by the love of His devotee. This particular pastime of Mother Yasoda binding her son is the perfect display of how the Lord is bound by this love. In fact Yasoda\u2019s very name\u2026Yasa means fame and da means giver; she is the giver of fame. So by this very pastime, she is increasing Krishna\u2019s fame, which is known throughout the entire three worlds as one who is controlled by the love of His devotees. This pastime is a very wonderful display of how the devotee's love defeats the Lord by making the Lord a plaything in the hand of His devotee. It is also a very wonderful display of His mercy potency, His kripa-sakti, because by His mercy, which He bestows upon His devotee, He allows His devotees to defeat Him by their love.\n\n\n\tIn this pastime, we see something unique. We generally do not hear about the Lord waiting for somebody else\u2019s judgment. The way most people think of the Lord is as the supreme judge; since it is ultimately He who creates the laws of the material nature and everyone else is subject to those laws. But it is rare to hear about the Lord waiting for somebody else\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\tMother Yasoda contemplated on whether she should free her son, letting Him do whatever He wanted to do, or whether she should bind her son. Krishna was left standing there, waiting for her to pass her judgment. He had to wait for her decision on what would be His fate. This is an example of how the Supreme Personality of Godhead subordinates Himself to the will of His devotees.\n\n\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that when there is competition between the devotee and the Lord, the devotee\u2019s will oftentimes prevails. Therefore we see in this pastime how the will of mother Yasoda prevailed over her son, and how she was able to defeat Him.\n\n\n\tSo there is a verse in Srimad Bhagavatam, which speaks a little bit about this. This verse has a very wonderful commentary by Srila Prabhupada. So I\u2019d like to read it. It's from the 10th Canto, 9th Chapter, verse 19.\n\n\n\tevam sandarsita hy anga\n\tharina bhrtya-vasyata\n\tsva-vasenapi krsnena\n\tyasyedam sesvaram vase\n\n\n\t\"O Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bksit, this entire universe, with its great, exalted demigods like Lord Siva, Lord Brahma and Lord Indra, is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet the Supreme Lord has one transcendental attribute: He comes under the control of His devotee. This was now exhibited by Krishna in this pastime.\"\n\n\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\n\n\n\tThis pastime of Krsna's is very difficult to understand, but devotees can understand it. It is therefore said, darsayams tad-vidam loka atmano bhakta-vasyatam (SB 10.11.9): the Lord displays the transcendental attribute of coming under the control of His devotees. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.35):\n\n\n\teko 'py asau racayitum jagad-anda-kotim\n\tyac-chaktir asti jagad-anda-caya yad-antah\n\tandantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham\n\tgovindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami\n\n\n\tBy His one plenary portion as Paramatma, the Lord controls innumerable universes, with all their demigods; yet He agrees to be controlled by a devotee. In the Upanisads it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can run with more speed than the mind, but here we see that although Krsna wanted to avoid being arrested by His mother, He was finally defeated, and Mother Yasoda captured Him. Laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam: [Bs. 5.29] Krsna is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Nonetheless, He steals butter like one who is poverty-stricken. Yamaraja, the controller of all living entities, fears the order of Krsna, yet Krsna is afraid of His mother's stick. These contradictions cannot be understood by one who is not a devotee, but a devotee can understand how powerful is unalloyed devotional service to Krsna; it is so powerful that Krsna can be controlled by an unalloyed devotee. This bhrtya-vasyata does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant's pure love. In Bhagavad-gita (1.21) it is said that Krsna became the chariot driver of Arjuna. Arjuna ordered Him, senayor ubhayor madhye ratham sthapaya me 'cyuta: \"My dear Krsna, You have agreed to be my charioteer and to execute my orders. Place my chariot between the two armies of soldiers.\" Krsna immediately executed this order, and therefore one may argue that Krsna also is not independent. But this is one's ajnana, ignorance. Krsna is always fully independent; when He becomes subordinate to His devotees, this is a display of ananda-cinmaya-rasa, the humor of transcendental qualities that increases His transcendental pleasure. Everyone worships Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller can be no one else but a pure devotee.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\n\n\tI do not know how I should organize this. On one hand I have been told that both of you [B.B. Govinda Swami and Caitanya Candra Caran Prabhu] are going to speak. On the other hand, both of you are telling me to speak. I am ready to speak but I don't want to speak in such a way that I disappoint the devotees by not giving adequate time for both of you to speak. So since Govinda Maharaja controls me by his affection, I'll have to accept whatever he orders me to do.\n\n\n\tGovinda Maharaja: \"Speak\".\n\n\n\tI am ready to speak but when should I stop? I should go on? (laughs) But you are very tired and you want to leave. (Speaks to Govinda Maharaja) He's tired from his long travel to Almaty and he wants to leave as early as possible. So I will not go too long. Anyways, I will speak a little bit and then we will see what happens.\n\n\n\tHere in the commentary Srila Prabhupada brings some very important points to light, that only a devotee can understand the Lord\u2019s pastimes. To a non-devotee, the Lord's pastimes may seem to be very contradictory and this pastime manifests a lot of contradictions for a person looking for them.\n\n\n\tFor instance, the Supreme Lord is known, as atmarama. By His very nature He is self-satisfied. But this whole pastime begins because the Lord is very hungry. In other words, If the Lord is self-satisfied, how is it that He is hungry? And not only that\u2026 He is the personification of peace and pure goodness. When His hunger is not sufficiently satisfied, He becomes angry. Another contradiction. ... He is supposed to be self-satisfied. But here it appears that He is not. He is angry.\n\n\n\tHe is also apta-kama. Apta-kama means that all His desires are fulfilled automatically. Yet, He is very dissatisfied in this pastime and He lets His mother know it. And as Prabhupada brings out in the commentary also, that the Supreme Lord is the master of the goddess of fortune. The Goddess of fortune bestows all kinds of benedictions. He is the master of unlimited goddesses of fortune. Simply by His thinking, He can manifest unlimited fortune. Yet He behaves like a beggar, so much so that He has to steal butter. This is beyond one\u2019s imagination. This is definitely a contradiction for someone who is looking for one.\n\n\n\tKrishna instills fear in everyone through time and by death. Yet, although all living beings throughout creation live with this fear, which is controlled by Krishna, He is running away in fear from His mother who is shaking a stick at Him\u2026 and He is really afraid.\n\n\n\tKrishna can travel at the speed of mind; He can travel even faster than the speed of the mind, yet His mother captures Him and keeps Him in her grip.\n\n\n\tAnother example\u2026 Krishna is sandrananda, which means that He is the full manifestation of condensed bliss. So how is it that the full manifestation of condensed bliss cries in a sorrowful mood?\n\n\n\tKrishna is unlimited, all-pervading. He says, \"By Me, in this unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.\" But although He is unlimited and all-pervading, He is limited by being tied up by His mother. Figure it out. And if we try to reconcile these contradictions from an external point of view, worldly-minded people could find all the excuses they wanted to not to surrender to Krishna. How can you surrender to somebody who\u2019s very existence is full of contradictions?\n\n\n\tThose who are inclined to look for contradictions will use them to justify their unwillingness to surrender. It's human nature. We scrutinize those who tell us to do something. The first thing we do is check, \"Are they doing it?\" The nature of the conditioned mind is to look for contradictions. The ability to surrender comes by having firm faith in the Absolute Truth in Whom there are no contradictions. Otherwise how can one have absolute faith if one sees too many contradictions?\n\n\n\tTaking all of these contradictions into consideration, Srila Prabhupada in his commentary makes it very clear that only a devotee can reconcile all of these contradictions because he knows what is the greatest of all the Lord's qualities. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes the quality of bhakta-vatsalya as the emperor of all the Lord\u2019s qualities, because it is this quality which can reconcile all contradictions. The Lord is controlled by the love of His pure devotees. He allows Himself to become defeated by their love.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada makes this point very clear in his commentary. When he translates the word bhrtya-vasyata, he says,\u00a0 \"This bhrtya-vasyata does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant's pure love.\" He makes this distinction. Just like Krishna tells Uddhava:\n\n\n\tna s\u0101dhayati m\u0101\u1e41 yogo\n\tna s\u0101\u1e45khya\u1e41 dharma uddhava\n\t(SB 11.14.20)\n\n\n\tHe said, \"Unalloyed devotional service rendered unto Me by My devotee brings Me under his control.\" He says, \"I cannot be controlled by austerities nor by the study of sankhya, nor by mystic yoga. None of these things bring Me under control, only unalloyed devotional service.\"\n\n\n\tSo Srila Prabhupada speaks about this often and here he is elaborating on this point in this commentary.\n\n\n\tIn one lecture Srila Prabhupada gave in 1966, he was explaining that by worshiping Krishna, one can become even greater than Krishna. He said, \"Everybody comes to Krishna asking something from Krishna, \u2018Oh Krishna, please give me this, give me that,' because everyone thinks that Krishna is the Supreme controller, proprietor and possessor of everything. But a devotee thinks, 'Krishna is dependent on me. If I don't feed Him, how will He eat?' Therefore a devotee can take a position even greater than Krishna.\"\n\tPrabhupada also makes that point here in this commentary. He said, \"Everyone worships Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller could be no one else but a pure devotee.\" In other words, Krishna is Bhagavan. He is the possessor of all opulences; the most wealthy, the most powerful, the most intelligent, the most beautiful, the most famous, and the most renounced. Those who worship Supreme Lord as Bhagavan, generally want something from Him. Therefore Prabhupada says, \"Sometimes Krishna desires to be controlled by someone else.\" This is how He enjoys. The Supreme Lord experiences great pleasure by being controlled by His devotee\u2019s pure love.\n\n\n\tTherefore we see here in this pastime, how mother Yasoda gives Krishna great pleasure. She gives Krishna pleasure because she thinks that He is her son, He is dependent on her, and she has to teach Him a lesson. Sometimes a mother has to teach her child a lesson by punishing the child. When the child misbehaves, the mother has to take a very strong position. In this pastime, Krishna is being chastised by His mother.\n\n\n\tIt all started when mother Yasoda was churning some yogurt into butter. She was churning some very special milk which she personally gathered herself. Someone may wonder, \"She is the queen of Vrindavana, why did she have to churn the yogurt into butter? She had so many maidservants who could do it for her.\"\n\n\n\tThey could all do it, but she wanted to personally do it. She selected the finest milk for Krishna, milk collected from the cows who were grazing on the grasses of Govardhana. This grass was especially aromatic. She was thinking, \"My son leaves home to steal butter from other\u2019s homes. Therefore I have to make the best butter so that He will be satisfied with what I provide for Him.\"\n\n\n\tSo she was churning the yogurt from this milk into butter. It was early in the morning before Krishna had awaken. She knew that it would be very difficult to do it when Krishna was awake because Krishna was always trying to get her attention. But on this particular morning, while she was churning the yogurt, Krishna awoke. He was thinking, \"My mother is not here. She must be doing something else\", because usually she is there whenever He wakes.\n\n\n\tSo Krishna went to search out His mother. He found her churning the yogurt into butter and Krishna, as we all know, was feeling hungry. Why is the Lord is hungry if He is fully self-satisfied. Is He really hungry? Yes, because He is hungry for prema. He is hungry for Yasoda\u2019s love. He is very hungry to satisfy mother Yasoda\u2019s desire to offer what she can offer to satisfy Him. So therefore He was thinking, \"My mother is very busy now, churning this yogurt into butter. Let me get her attention. So He came and put His hand on the churning rod, trying to get her to stop.\n\n\n\tThe acaryas give an explanation of what Krishna was trying to do. The impersonalists, are always churning different philosophies in their minds in an attempt to understand the Supreme. In this way, their minds are constantly churning and churning, churning and churning. Just like Lord Brahma, in his prayer to Krishna he says, \"Such persons are like persons who beat an empty husk of wheat to get the grain. All they get is their hard labor.\" There is no grain in an empty husk of wheat. So people who speculate, who continuously churn and churn and churn to try to understand the Supreme, they are like such persons who beat an empty husk of wheat. The only fruit they get is their hard labor. Krishna can never be understood by such a churning process.\n\n\n\tSo Krishna grabbed the churning rod to suggest to mother Yasoda, \"You already have Me, why do you have to waste your time churning? You already possess Me by your love.\" But Mother Yasoda understood that Krishna wanted to be breastfed. So she then took her child in her lap and offered her breast milk to satisfy His hunger. While she was feeding Him, there was a pot of milk that was on the stove that began boiling over.\n\n\n\tSo some people may wonder, \"Why did mother Yasoda decide to put Krishna down for just a small pot of milk?\" Nanda Maharaja possesses nine hundred thousand cows and there is no lack of milk. And she had her son on her lap and she was offering her milk to Him. But still she decided to save that pot of milk. So as we said, that pot of milk was special. It was personally selected milk and her meditation was that it was for Krishna. So the milk on the stove was for Krishna and the milk that she was offering from her breast, it was for Krishna. So both were for Krishna. It was not that she was thinking, \"Oh, I do not want to have to clean up the mess,\" and that is why she was putting Krishna down.\"Someone may think that was Mother Yasoda\u2019s motivation for getting up. But it was not. She was actually thinking\u2026, \"This is special milk for Krishna.\" So her motivation in getting up to get that milk was pure and selfless.\n\n\n\tNow why was the milk overflowing? Our acaryas also give an explanation for this. The milk was overflowing because the milk was thinking, \"Mother Yasoda is giving all her milk to Krishna. What purpose do I have for living?\" The milk was thinking, \u2026 in the spiritual world everything is personified\u2026. So the milk was thinking, \"Mother Yasoda is giving all her milk to Krishna, so then what is the purpose of my existence? Better I just commit suicide and throw myself into the fire!\" So the milk started flowing over the pot in an attempt to commit suicide. So when mother Yasoda put Krishna down to run and stop the milk from overflowing, the milk immediately became embarrassed for what she had done by forcing Yasoda to put Krishna down. The milk then stopped overflowing from the pot and mother Yasoda was able to go back and continue feeding her son.\n\n\n\tBut, of course, Krishna wasn't there because Krishna became angry. Here we have the personification of pure goodness and peace, but He became angry. He became angry to give pleasure to His mother. His whole existence was welling up in anger, but that was also to enhance mother Yasoda\u2019s pleasure. And therefore by manifesting that anger, at that point, He then started to engage in His nefarious activities of breaking open the pot of yogurt.\n\n\n\tThe yogurt started flowing out of the pot. Krishna then ran into the other room and started taking the butter which was hanging in the rafters and began distributing it to the monkeys. Although she was not gone very long, but when Mother Yasoda came back she discovered that Krishna was no longer there and that all the yogurt was all over the ground. She went into the other room and immediately understood that obviously Krishna has to be behind all of this. Everything that has been done here is too calculated to be happening by chance. She was thinking that it must be her mischievous son.\n\n\n\tFrom a distance, Mother Yasoda saw Krishna sitting on top of the wooden grinding mortar, distributing butter to the monkeys. She decided that she had to chastise her son and to punish him. She picked up a stick and Krishna started running in fear. He ran first to the front of the courtyard because He was thinking, \"My mother wants to punish Me with the stick but she won\u2019t do it in public. So better I run out of the yard as quickly as possible so that others will see and then she won\u2019t beat me.\n\n\n\tKrishna was running. He was very calculating. And why was He calculating?...because He wanted to continue to play with His friends. That was His desire. Krishna didn\u2019t want to be punished; He didn\u2019t want to be tied up. And although He knew that mother Yasoda was going to do something like that, He tried to avoid it.\n\n\n\tSo while mother Yasoda was chasing her son with the stick she loudly cried, \"Stop, you thief!\" Krishna responded, \"No, you stop right there! Don\u2019t come any closer!\" He challenged her, \"If you come any closer to me and if you think I am doing mischief now, you wait and see what I will do.\"\n\n\n\tAlthough Krishna is the Supreme Absolute Truth, sometimes He lies. Mother Yasoda would have to hear so many complaints from the local cowherd women such as, \"Your son comes in the morning and steals our butter. Not only does He steal butter, but sometimes He unties the calves so the calves go and drink all the milk from the cows. He does all these mischievous activities, We've come to complain to you about your son Krishna.\" Krishna would stand right there in front of all of them and would then say, \"I don\u2019t know why they are making these lies about Me. I simply go to their homes because I\u2019m attracted to them and to My friends. I don\u2019t do any of these things.\" In this way Supreme Absolute Truth lies.\n\n\n\tSo Mother Yasoda knew what Krishna was capable of doing. So Krishna is warning mother Yasoda to stop, \"Don\u2019t go any further.\" Mother Yasoda was then thinking, \"I have to limit my mischievous son\u2019s activities.\" Krishna then started to cry.\n\n\n\tMother Yasoda became afraid when she saw Krishna crying because she could see that He was really afraid. She therefore put the stick down. She didn\u2019t want Krishna to become more afraid than He already was. But still she wanted to tie him up and began to think, \"I have to restrict Him because He is engaging in so much mischief. I need to teach him a lesson.\" She decided she would tie him to the wooden grinding mortar.\n\n\n\tSo Mother Yasoda took a rope and began to tie up her son. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that when she tried to tie Krishna, Krishna, through his satya-sankalpa sakti manifested His vibhuti-sakti. The satya-sankalpa sakti is the potency of the Lord that fulfills all His desires. And the vibhuti-sakti is His opulence which displays something very wonderful. So the vibhuti-sakti manifested in the rope which was always two fingers too short. As much as Mother Yasoda attempted to tie the rope it was always just two fingers too short.\n\n\n\tBy this time the other cowherd women came to see what was happening. They tried to suggest to mother Yasoda, \"Maybe you won\u2019t be very successful in tying up your son.\" But Mother Yasoda was very determined and told them, \"No, I\u2019m determined to find the extent of my son\u2019s waist.\" She then asked the other cowherd women, \"Please go and find whatever rope you can find and bring it here.\"\n\n\n\tSo all the other women brought more ropes for mother Yasoda and she started tying them all together. But every time she tried to bind Him, she was not successful- the rope was always two fingers too short. Krishna didn\u2019t want to be bound up.\n\n\n\tMother Yasoda was so determined. She manifested what is called \"parisrama.\" Parisrama means - very hard labor. She was laboring so hard to tie up her son that when Krishna saw how hard she was working to tie Him up, His heart melted and became as soft as butter. He manifested His kripa-sakti. The kripa-sakti is this potency that we described before. It is His greatest mercy - it is His greatest opulence. It\u2019s the opulence by which the Lord comes under the control of His devotees' desires. He completely submits His will to the will of His devotee. That\u2019s how He enjoys. He enjoys being controlled by His pure devotee\u2019s love. He doesn\u2019t want to be God all the time.\n\n\n\tEverybody worships Him as God. But, as Prabhupada says, \"Sometimes the Supreme Lord wants to be controlled by somebody else\u2019s love.\" This means that He doesn\u2019t want to be the supreme controller. He\u2019d rather be controlled. But only a devotee, a pure devotee, can control the Lord. So His mercy potency, His kripa-sakti, manifested, His heart melted, and became soft just like butter.\n\n\n\tTwo other important qualities were manifested in this pastime\u2026 bhakta-nistha, which was the firm faith of the devotee and sva-nistha, the steady quality of the Lord. The bhakta-nistha was mother Yasoda\u2019s conviction, \"I will tie up my son and punish Him.\" When this bhakta-nistha was manifested then Krishna\u2019s satya-sankalpa sakti and His vibhuti-sakti left and the distance of two fingers was immediately removed. When bhakta-nistha and sva-nistha are present the Lord can be bound. Mother Yasoda made her judgment and the Lord became bound.\n\n\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, \"In the competition between devotee and the Lord, the devotee's will always prevails. The devotees defeat the Lord by their love. And therefore this pastime of being bound by the ropes of\u00a0 Mother Yasoda is the Damodara-lila, and as we said in the beginning - mother Yasoda\u2019s binding Krishna with this rope of her love as displayed in this pastime is what increases the glories of the Lord. The Lord is famous as being controlled by the love of His devotee and Yasoda -Yasa da - is one who gives fame to the Lord. She spreads the Lords fame by the display of her unalloyed love in defeating her son. And this is the very wonderful and beautiful characteristic of the Lord.\n\n\n\tSuch meditations of the Lord are the type of meditations we should we think about especially during this month of Damodara. Such is the power of the love the devotee has over the Lord.\n\n\n\tThere are many other details we could explain in this pastime but maybe we can leave them for others to discuss. As I said - I did not want to speak too long. And I thought others, if they wish, could say a few words about Lord Damodara for the pleasure of all the Vaisnavas and for my purification as well. So I should just stop here.\n\n\n\tHare Krishna.\n\n","nid":"20697"},{

Then the devotee is established in goodness, and he becomes completely happy.\n\n\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada:\n\n\n\tA living being in his normal constitutional position is fully satisfied in spiritual bliss. This state of existence is called brahma-bh\u016bta or atmananda, or the state of self-satisfaction. This self-satisfaction is not like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorance, whereas the self-satisfied atmanandi is transcendental to the material state of existence. This stage of perfection is attained as soon as one is fixed in irrevocable devotional service. Devotional service is not inactivity, but the unalloyed activity of the soul.\n\n\n\tThe soul\u2019s activity becomes adulterated in contact with matter, and as such the diseased activities are expressed in the form of lust, desire, hankering, inactivity, foolishness and sleep. The effect of devotional service becomes manifest by complete elimination of these effects of passion and ignorance. The devotee is fixed at once in the mode of goodness, and he makes further progress to rise to the position of vasudeva, or the state of unmixed sattva, or suddha-sattva. Only in this suddha-sattva state can one always see Krishna face to face by dint of pure affection for the Lord.\n\n\n\tA devotee is always in the mode of unalloyed goodness; therefore he harms no one. But the nondevotee, however educated he may be, is always harmful. A devotee is neither foolish nor passionate. The harmful, foolish and passionate cannot be devotees of the Lord, however they may advertise themselves as devotees by outward dress. A devotee is always qualified with all the good qualities of God. Quantitatively such qualifications may be different, but qualitatively both the Lord and His devotee are one and the same.\n\t(SB 1.2.19)\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n\n\n\tSo we are reading some very important verses from Srimad Bhagavatam. These verses describe the cleansing of the heart by devotional service, and how obstacles are removed from the heart for those who engage in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord in the association of devotees. In this verse today, the Srimad Bhagavatam is explaining how one comes to the platform of nistha, or steadiness in devotional service, and some of the symptoms of one who is situated on this platform.\u00a0 One who is on this platform is not affected by the modes of material nature. It is important to understand that there may be some trace of the modes of material nature even for one who is situated on this platform, but the point is that one is not influenced by them, and this is established here by the words ceta etair anaviddham, which means that one is not affected in the mind by these.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada, I remember, used an example of how a devotee is one who stays in the boat of devotional service. If one is crossing the ocean and there is a lot of disturbance in the middle of the ocean, with so many waves, as long as one stays in the boat, though he will be influenced by the waves, at least he is not in the waves themselves.\n\n\n\tIt is one thing to be drowning in the waves in the middle of the ocean, but it is another thing to be in the boat. In other words, although one may be influenced by those waves in the boat, rocking back and forth, still one is in the boat. Srila Prabhupada said that to stay in the boat means that one should strictly follow the regulative principles of Krishna consciousness. This is what keeps us in the boat as opposed to jumping ship. If one jumps ship, there is not much hope.\n\n\n\tOf course, Prabhupada uses that example to help us understand the importance of strictly following the regulative principles, not only the four regulative principles but the regulative principles of devotional service. Krishna says to Arjuna:\n\n\n\tatha cittam samadhatum\n\tna saknoshi mayi sthiram\n\tabhyasa-yogena tato\n\tmam icchaptum dhananjaya\n\t(BG 12.9)\n\n\n\t\"If you cannot always fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way you will develop the desire to attain Me.\"\n\n\n\tKrishna is not speaking to Arjuna about following the four regulative principles, He is talking to Arjuna about following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, which means \"nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya,\" mentioned in the previous verse, which is \"by regularly hearing Srimad Bhagavatam and serving the devotees, all that is inauspicious to the heart becomes destroyed.\" The four regulative principles are the regulative principles of human life, not the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. The four regulative principles are what distinguishes a human being from an animal. Krishna is telling Arjuna to follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, which means that one has to regulate one\u2019s hearing and chanting of the glories of the Supreme Lord. By regularly hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord in the association of devotees, the inauspicious things from within the heart become practically, but not completely, destroyed. The word \"practically\" is used because there is still some trace of influence of these modes of material nature. But one is not influenced by them.\n\n\n\tSrila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that the modes of material nature are not completely gone until one achieves the stage of bhava. Nonetheless, as Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains, the transition that one goes through by regularly hearing the message of Srimad Bhagavatam means that one passes through the stage of anisthita-bhakti to nisthita-bhakti. Anisthita-bhakti means unsteady devotional service, and nisthita-bhakti means steady devotional service. Then Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur explains the verses that we were reading in the last few days,\n\n\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam\n\t(SB 1.2.17)\n\n\n\tSri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cleanses the desire for material enjoyment within the heart of that person who develops the urge to hear His messages. This verse is actually for those who are still situated on the platform of anisthita-bhakti. Yesterday\u2019s verse bhaktir bhavati naisthiki (SB 1.2.18), is the verse which describes nisthita-bhakti for those who are on the platform of nistha, and in the middle, between these two stages, is abhadrani vidhunoti, which means that inauspicious things become destroyed within the heart, which is anartha-nivritti. So there is anisthita-bhakti, unsteady devotional service; anartha-nivritti; and nisthita-bhakti; or bhajana-kriya, anartha-nivritti and nistha. Nonetheless the cleansing of the heart means removing the obstacles on the path of devotional service, and those obstacles exist due to one still being influenced by the modes of nature. And therefore Prabhupada, today in the commentary, says that self-satisfaction in the stage of devotional service, this self satisfaction is not like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorance, whereas the self-satisfied atmanandi is transcendental to the material state of existence.\n\n\n\tIt is interesting how Prabhupada describes a person who is influenced by the mode of ignorance in the Bhagavad-gita. With respect to the inactive fool and the satisfaction he experiences, Prabhupada explains that when there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, then darkness, inertia, madness and illusion are manifested. This is Krishna\u2019s illusion. To quote Srila Prabhupada, 'One in the mode of ignorance does not work by a regulative principle; he wants to act whimsically, for no purpose. Even though he has the capacity to work, he makes no endeavor. This is called illusion. Although consciousness is going on, life is inactive. These are the symptoms of one in the mode of ignorance.\"\n\n\n\tMany times Srila Prabhupada told the story about Indra when he was cursed by Brihaspati. Indra had to come down to this world and take birth as a hog. He had a hog family; he had his hog wife, he had his hog children. And then Lord Brahma was calling Indra to come back. when Indra was being called, he was thinking, \"Well, I have my wife, I have my children. Everything is going well. Why do I have to go back?\" Prabhupada uses this example, that the hog is satisfied living in stool. He thinks, \"This is nice, I am satisfied,\" but somebody from a higher level of consciousness looks and says, \"Oh, how can you be satisfied in that status?\"\n\n\n\tSo Prabhupada is saying here that one who is steeped in the mode of ignorance is like the inactive fool. The inactive fool thinks, \"Yes, I am satisfied, things are OK. I am satisfied with my ignorance. I am satisfied being inactive, there is nothing I am doing. I am just satisfied living like this. I am not influenced by the mode of ignorance.\" But the mode of ignorance is manifested by darkness, inertia, madness and illusion. What is the symptom of passion? The symptom of passion is intense hankering in fruitive activity, always hankering for some result. When one comes to the stage of steady devotional service, this influence of the modes of ignorance and passion, is virtually nonexistent. That is the symptom of steadiness in devotional service, that there are no symptoms of the influence of the modes of nature.\n\n\n\tVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that for one who comes to this level of nisthita-bhakti, actually situated on the platform of nistha, there are no symptoms of laya, or sleepiness while engaged in bhajan or kirtan. He describes the five symptoms of those still influenced.\n\n\n\tThe first symptom is laya, the tendency to sleep when one is engaged in kirtan, showing that there is still some influence of the mode of ignorance. Then there is viksepa, distraction. Viksepa means when one is distracted by tendencies towards material things while engaged in kirtan, like a devotee who is sitting and chanting japa, and then all of the sudden he is distracted by a tendency to speak prajalpa to the person next to him. He tried to be very visibly attentive, \"Hareee...\" and then\u2026 prajalpa. The third symptom of being influenced by the modes of material nature is apratipatti which means that although there is no visible influence by laya, or viksepa, still one cannot completely fix his mind in bhajan. Kasaya, that is the next symptom, means one is still influenced by pride, greed and anger. Obviously these are symptoms that one is still influenced by the modes of nature. And rasasvada, which is the fifth symptom means\u00a0 that although one has all facility to be absorbed in kirtan, whenever there is a proposal for some sense gratification, one gets distracted.\n\n\n\tSo nisthita-bhakti or nistha means that there is no influence; all these symptoms are gone. So of course, that is an advanced stage. Anisthita-bhakti is probably something which is more relevant for our discussion. The verse states \"srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah,\" that Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is within the core of the heart. He cleanses the desire for material enjoyment within the heart of a person who develops an urge to hear.\n\n\n\tSo this anisthita-bhakti is symptomized by six characteristics which are all explained by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura. The first is utsaha-mayi, false enthusiasm. A person with this symptom thinks that because he has developed an ability to do something in bhakti, he is therefore qualified. He is enthusiastic, because people recognize his expertise. \"I can play karatalas, really expertly!\" Somebody sees, \"Oh, you play very good karatalas.\" \"Yes, I am a very advanced devotee.\" And as soon as somebody does not recognize his expert karatala playing, immediately he loses his enthusiasm. So this is called utsaha-mayi, false enthusiasm. It is not real. That is the first symptom.\n\n\n\tThe second is ghana-tarala. Ghana-tarala means that sometimes we are very, very attentive in our studies, completely into it. But then sometimes we are just not into it at all. We get absorbed in our mind and therefore cannot get into our studies at all. Ghana-tarala means thick and diluted. Then there is vyudha vikalpa. Vyudha vikalpa means indecisiveness. \"Should I become renounced, forget about my duties in householder life; renounce everything? Yet when I read in the Bhagavatam there are so many householders, very elevated, saintly persons, some of them were even Mahajanas, I think I could become a householder. Look at the list of Mahajanas (SB 6.3.20-21). Many are householders. Of course I should follow in their footsteps, but household life is very troublesome. I can read about that in Bhagavatam too. What should I do?\" Vyudha vikalpa; we live in a state of indecisiveness, going back and forth, \"Should I renounce or not be renounced?\" I think my mind is busy, engaged in devotional service. But I'm simply busy going back and forth, accepting and rejecting.\n\n\n\tThere is no nistha, there is no resolute determination. Simply riding on the chariot of the mind, manorathena. Lord Caitanya says:\n\n\n\t\u2018dvaite\u2019 bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba \u2014 \u2018manodharma\u2019\n\t\u2018ei bhala, ei manda\u2019, \u2014 ei saba \u2018bhrama\u2019\n\t(CC Antya 4.176)\n\n\n\t\"To say this is good and bad, this is all a mistake.\" He said this to Sanatana Gosvami. Sanatana Gosvami pleaded, \"Please do not touch my body. It is bad.\" Sanatana Gosvami\u2019s body was full of sores and Lord Caitanya wanted to embrace him. And Lord Caitanya responded, \"No, actually to think \u2018this is good and this is bad\u2019, this is all a mistake. It is an illusion.\" And He used the word, \u2018dvaite\u2019 bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba \u2014 \u2018manodharma\u2019. Manodharma means the religion of mind: \"this is good, this is bad.\" Or as the verse says,\n\n\n\tyasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana\n\tsarvair gunais tatra samasate surah\n\tharav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna\n\tmanorathenasati dhavato bahih\n\t(SB 5.18.12)\n\n\n\tPrabhupada would quote this verse many times, how all the qualities of the demigods become manifested in a devotee. On the other hand, a nondevotee cannot have any good qualities because he is driven on the chariot of the mind. So one has to be careful not to be influenced by this manorathena, to be riding on the chariot of the mind.\n\n\n\tSo vyudha vikalpa means manorathena, indecisiveness. Then there is visaya-sangara. Visaya-sangara is another symptom of anisthita-bhakti, which means that sometimes we get very determined, \"I see what my maya is, I am going to renounce it. Better I make a vow and give it up.\" Then the next day we indulge in the very same thing we had renounced. Then we think, \"Oh, why did I do that?\"\n\n\n\tIn fact there is a verse in the 11th Canto of the Bhagavatam, which illustrates this tendency. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also quotes this verse in reference to visaya-sangara. It is a very important verse because it is very much related to these verses that we are reading from Srimad Bhagavatam. The verse says, \"Having awakened faith in hearing the narrations of My glories, being disgusted with sense gratification, and knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering, but one still cannot give it up.\" He said, \"Therefore\u2026\" Krishna says, \"But My devotee should remain happy and continue worshipping with faith and conviction, because My devotee knows that even though sense gratification leads to suffering, he sincerely repents when he engages in it.\"\n\n\n\tSo this sincere repentance in the heart is very important. This verse illustrates the point about visaya-sangara; that we renounce something and then very soon we indulge in the very same thing we renounced. However for a devotee who has awakened his faith in hearing about Krishna, because he has awakened faith, \"srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah\", he has the urge to hear more and more about Krishna. He goes on hearing because he knows that by continuing to do so, he can remain happy. By hearing, all these unwanted things will become destroyed. This is how he gets free from the symptoms of anisthita-bhakti: \"nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya\", by regularly hearing Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a regulative principle of devotional service, we are regularly hearing.\n\n\n\tsatam prasa\u1e45gan mama virya-samvido\n\tbhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani\n\tsraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati\n\t(SB 3.25.25)\n\n\n\tIn the association of devotees, discussions of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead become very pleasing to the ear and to the heart. They go into the ear and enter into the heart. And when they enter into the heart, what happens? The devotee advances. Gradually, his faith becomes strong. He develops some attachment to Krishna. Then bhakti, real devotional service, begins. Sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati means from sraddha all the way to prema, even those who are on the platform of prema, \"prayena munayo rajan nivrtta vidhi-sedhatah\" (SB 2.1.7), they derive their greatest satisfaction by hearing and chanting about Krishna. It begins with regulation, beginning with faith. Then progressively, regulation subsides because it becomes spontaneous, all the way to prema.\n\n\n\tIn the 10th Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam when Pariksit Maharaja and Sukadeva Gosvami are having some dialogue, Sukadeva Gosvami says, \"Paramahamsas who have accepted Krishna within the core of their heart, they are attracted to the topics of Krishna as if they are ever fresh. And therefore they are spontaneously attracted to Krishna in the same way that a materialistic person is spontaneously attracted to speaking about women and sex.\" A materialistic person does not have to practice talking about women and sex. Why? It is spontaneous. Why? It is always in the heart. Therefore, because it is always in the heart, spontaneously he speaks about these things. The slightest attractive object he sees, immediately and spontaneously it awakens a desire to speak about these topics. Similarly, paramahamsas who have accepted Krishna within the core of their hearts, they are spontaneously attracted to speaking about Krishna. They have accepted Krishna within the core of their heart, therefore to speak about Him is spontaneous, because they see Krishna in everything, they see Krishna everywhere.\n\n\n\tSo in the most advanced stages, certainly, one spontaneously speaks about Krishna. But for those on the platform of anisthita-bhakti, it is not so spontaneous. And because it is not spontaneous, one has to regularly hear\u2014 regularly! These are regulative principle of bhakti yoga; one has to regularly hear.\n\n\n\tsmartavyah satatam visnur\n\tvismartavyo na jatucit\n\tsarve vidhi-nisedhah syur\n\tetayor eva kinkarah\n\t(CC Madhya 22.113)\n\n\n\t\"Krishna must always be remembered and He must never be forgotten. All the rules and regulations given in the scriptures are meant to be the servant of these two principles.\"\n\n\n\tServants of these two principles; vidhis and nisedhas. Vidhis means positive activities, nisedhas are prohibited activities. Positive activities: always think of Krishna. Negative activities we should avoid: do not forget Krishna. This is what we avoid, forgetfulness of Krishna. The positive is to always remember. So all these vidhis and nisedhas are meant to serve these two principles. But in the commentary of this verse, there is a very nice explanation. Smartavyah satatam, generally satatam means \"always;\" however in this verse, it implies something different. Because for one who is always remembering Krishna, why does he have to worry about forgetting Him? For one who is always speaking about Krishna, why does he have to worry about saying something that is not related to Krishna? Why should he think about wanting to say anything that is not Krishna conscious? He is always speaking about Krishna. Why does he have to think about prohibited activities? He is always speaking about Krishna.\n\n\n\tTherefore in this verse means, the word \"satatam\" instead of meaning \"always\" means \"every day.\" Every day we must regularly hear. This is our regulative principle of bhakti yoga. This festival is meant to remind us of what we are supposed to be doing every day when we leave. It is not just, \"Oh, I am going to hear at the festival,\" and then we go back and think, \"Until the next festival.\" No, it is not from festival to festival. It is every day. Why? Because it cleanses the heart; that makes us qualified to relish Srimad Bhagavatam. It makes us qualified to get some taste, because we are regulating our lives around devotional service. And gradually, then, the influence of these unwanted things will be destroyed. This is the power. This is what is being explained in today\u2019s verse; the influence of the modes of passion and ignorance will be gone.\n\n\n\tOf course, we did not mention the other symptoms of anisthita bhakti. Quickly we will just mention them; after visaya-sangara is niyamaksama. For example, we make a vow to chant extra rounds but we cannot keep them. \"Every Ekadasi, I am going to completely fast.\" Somebody walks by with a plate of prasadam, \"\u2026starting next Ekadasi.\" So that is niyamaksama. And taranga-rangini means enjoying the waves of bhakti. Sometimes bhakti is attractive, the person has a little bhakti, he becomes attractive to others and sometimes we get some benefits by being engaged in bhakti. We may get some facility, we may get our own room in the asrama, we may get some respect. Immediately we think, \"Oh, yes! I am going to enjoy.\" So taranga-rangini means enjoying the waves that come from being engaged in bhakti.\n\n\n\tSo these are all symptoms of anisthita-bhakti, and as we said these symptoms are probably more relevant to discuss, symptoms of how the modes of material nature will influence us. However these important verses from Srimad Bhagavatam that we have been reading from the last several days give every devotee hope of how we can come to a higher platform. And for us, these things that we spoke about, of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam regularly in the association of devotees, that for us is staying in the boat. We will still be influenced until we actually come to that platform of nisthita-bhakti, but we should simply stay in the boat. Staying in the boat means chanting our rounds, following the four regulative principles, and engaging in the regulative principle of devotional service. Krishna says:\n\n\n\tatha cittam samadhatum\n\tna saknosi mayi sthiram\n\t(BG 12.9)\n\n\n\t\"If you follow these regulative principles of devotional service, the desire to attain Me will be awakened in your heart.\"\n\n\n\tHare Krishna. All glories to Prabhupada.\n\n","nid":"19395"},{

In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 4.176) it is said:\n\n\n\t\u201ddvaite\u201d bhadr\u0101bhadra-j\u00f1\u0101na, saba\u2014\u2014\u201dmanodharma\u201d\n\t\u201dei bh\u0101la, ei manda\u201d,\u2014\u2014ei saba \u201dbhrama\u201d\n\n\n\tThe distinctions between happiness and distress in the material world of duality are simply mental concoctions, for the so-called happiness and distress are actually one and the same. They are like the happiness and distress in dreams. A sleeping man creates his happiness and distress by dreaming, although actually they have no existence.\n\n\n\tThe other example given in this verse is that a flower garland is originally very nice, but by mistake, for want of mature knowledge, one may consider it a snake. In this connection there is a statement by Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b: vi\u015bva\u1e41 p\u016br\u1e47a-sukh\u0101yate. Everyone in this material world is distressed by miserable conditions, but \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b says that this world is full of happiness. How is this possible? He answers, yat- k\u0101ru\u1e47ya-kat\u0101k\u1e63a-vaibhavavat\u0101\u1e41 ta\u1e41 gauram eva stuma\u1e25. A devotee accepts the distress of this material world as happiness only due to the causeless mercy of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. By His personal behavior, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu showed that He was never distressed but always happy in chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. One should follow in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and engage constantly in chanting the mah\u0101-mantra\u2014Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Then he will never feel the distresses of the world of duality. In any condition of life one will be happy if he chants the holy name of the Lord.\n\n\n\tIn dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes suffer as if one of our beloved family members had died. Because the same mind and body exist in the same material world of duality when we are awake, the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the false, superficial happiness of dreams. The mind is the via medium in both dreams and wakefulness, and everything created by the mind in terms of sa\u1e45kalpa and vikalpa, acceptance and rejection, is called manodharma, or mental concoction.\n\n\n\tHH Niranjana Swami\n\n\n\t(Pranama Mantras)\n\n\n\tFirst I would like to thank all of the assembled vaisnavas for this opportunity to render service. I pray to all of the vaisnavas who are here today to bless me that I may render this service with some devotion, for only then can these words be pleasing to the vaisnavas who are always eager to drink the nectar, honey, from the lotus feet of the Lord.\n\n\n\tI just noticed this morning that this verse is, interestingly, spoken by Lord Siva. Since today is also Sivaratri, it is appropriate to say something that he has given to us. It is also the Kirtan Mela and I've been requested to say something about the chanting of the holy name. I thought this verse was very appropriate because in the purport, Srila Prabhupada speaks very clearly about the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and how the holy name of the Lord can impact our lives, spiritually.\n\n\n\tThis verse, as we said, is spoken by Lord Siva. The setting is him sitting with Parvati on Mount Sumeru. As we know, Citraketu Maharaja had been flying above and was observing how Lord Siva was sitting with Parvati on his lap. He made some statement about that in a disparaging way. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that this was arranged by the Lord so that Citraketu Maharaja could very quickly be brought back to the spiritual world.\n\n\n\tWhen Citraketu Maharaja had spoken in this way, Parvati had heard what he had said and was very disturbed that he was speaking this way about Lord Siva. After deliberation, she decided that she should curse Citraketu Maharaja to take birth as a demon. When Citraketu Maharaja heard the curse, he immediately came forward before Parvati and Lord Siva and spoke in a way of complete and full acceptance of the curse. Parvati was quite astonished. \"How is it that I've just cursed him to become a demon and he is so equipoised and so accepting of this curse?\"\n\n\n\tLord Siva began to describe the characteristics of vaisnavas. He quoted the well-known verse that Srila Prabhupada would often quote:\n\n\n\tn\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101\u1e25 sarve na kuta\u015bcana bibhyati svarg\u0101pavarga-narake\u1e63v api tuly\u0101rtha-dar\u015bina\u1e25\n\n\n\tThat the devotees do not fear any condition of life. Whether they are in Heaven, Hell, or liberated, for them it is all the same. Devotees are fixed and interested in only one thing and that is to be engaged in rendering service to the Lord. Therefore Lord Siva, after speaking this verse, spoke about how the living entities who are not fixed in devotional service have to live with the conception of duality.\n\n\n\tThen he spoke in this verse. This is the next verse which says that as one mistakenly considers a flower garland to be a snake, or experiences happiness or distress in a dream, so in the material world by a lack of careful consideration, we differentiate between happiness and distress, considering one good and the other bad.\n\n\n\tIn the eleventh canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, there is an interesting verse in this connection. This verse was spoken in a conversation between Narada Muni and Vasudeva. Vasudeva was inquiring about the nature of devotional service and how, by engagement in devotional service, one can become free from fear. Narada Muni quoted a conversation which had taken place earlier between the nine Yogendras and King Nimi. King Nimi had inquired in a similar way about the characteristics of devotional service. In that conversation, Kavi, one of the nine Yogendras, explained to King Nimi about the nature of fear and how it arises due to misidentification with the material body, and by being influenced by the external energy of the Lord. Then he explains that this is the nature of fear, that when one turns away from Krsna he forgets his identity as the servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n\tIn the next verse he explains the exact same point which is mentioned in today's verse. I'll quote the verse as I remember it in English and then I'll explain it because it is very enlightening. He says that although the duality of the material world does not ultimately exist, the conditioned soul considers it to be real, under the influence of his conditioned intelligence. This imaginary experience of a world which is separate from Krsna, can be compared to the acts of dreaming and desiring.\n\n\n\tWhen a conditioned soul dreams at night of something very wonderful or something very horrible, or when he daydreams of something he would like to have, or something he would like to avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his imagination. The tendency of the mind is to accept and reject things on the basis of sense gratification. The intelligent person therefore must control the mind, restricting it from the tendency of being in the illusion of seeing things separate from Krsna. When the mind is thus controlled, one will become free from all fear. That is the verse.\n\n\n\tNow I will explain it. It is a long verse. The explanation is very interesting. When I give the explanation, I try to bring it down to something that is very tangible, something within our realm of experience. The verse is actually bringing it within our realm of experience when it talks about dreams.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada often would give an analogy about how beneficial analogies are. He gives the analogy that if one wants to see the movement of the moon in the sky, when looking at it directly, it's very difficult to see how the moon is moving. But when we look at the moon through the branches of a tree, it is much easier to see how the moon is moving. The branches are closer to us. They are closer to our experience. By seeing it through the branches we can see how it is moving.\n\n\n\tIn the same way, the sage Kavi is giving us an analogy about the duality of the material world. He's comparing it to dreams. Have any of you ever had a dream before? I think some of you may have experienced this. The next question is \u201cHave any of you ever had a bad dream before?\u201d That is something within the realm of your experience. Have any of you ever had a good dream before? Yes. Something also within the realm of your experience.\n\n\n\tThe sage, Kavi, is saying that when the conditioned soul dreams at night of something very wonderful or something very horrible, or when he daydreams of something he would like to have or avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his imagination.\n\n\n\tNow how is that? Just like, we may have a terrible dream. I've experienced it also. I fly a lot. I oftentimes experience that when I'm flying and I fall asleep I dream that the plane is dropping very fast. When I wake up, I'm happy. I feel very relieved. You may have had bad dreams. When you wake up you're very happy. You may have a good dream. I'm not going to explain what a good dream is. You have to consider it for yourself. Generally, a good dream is very enjoyable. When you wake up, \"Oh, it was only a dream.\" You're sad. But what is the nature of that happiness and sadness? It's not connected to reality. It's connected only to a dream. It has no connection to reality. We create a reality that has no existence beyond our imagination. Now that's the night dream.\n\n\n\tKavi also speaks about the daydream. The daydream, as Srila Prabhupada also says right here in this purport, is no different than the night dream. During the daydream, we dream of something we would like to have or something we would like to avoid. Sometimes, the anticipation of attaining what we would like to have in our daydream brings us great happiness. After attaining it, oftentimes we realize that it's temporary and that realization in itself may lead to distress.\n\n\n\tSimilarly, in thinking to try and avoid certain things we dream, \"Oh yes. I've been able to avoid suffering. Therefore, I'm happy.\" Some people even define their happiness by the fact that they're not suffering. Somebody asks, \"Well, how are you, Prabhu?\" \"Oh, things are good. I'm not suffering.\" Therefore we live our life thinking about how to avoid suffering.\n\n\n\tThis is not a very good mission for life, simply trying to avoid suffering. There's more to life than avoiding suffering. We'll talk about that later in relationship to the holy name. The sage Kavi is explaining to us that both the happiness and the distress connected to the dream and the happiness and distress connected to the daydream creates a reality that has no existence beyond our imagination. Therefore the intelligent person must control the mind, restricting it from the tendency of seeing things separate from Krsna.\n\n\n\tNow, it's very interesting that Srila Prabhupada has also quoted in this commentary a verse spoken by Lord Caitanya. He has quoted the verse:\n\n\n\t'dvaite' bhadr\u0101bhadra-j\u00f1\u0101na, saba \u2014 'manodharma'\n\t'ei bh\u0101la, ei manda', \u2014 ei saba 'bhrama'\n\n\n\tThat in this material world the conceptions of good and bad are all mental speculation. Therefore to say this is good and this is bad is all a mistake. It's interesting that the word that is used here is manodharma, the religion of the mind. This is the dharma of the mind, to see duality. He's speaking this verse to Sanatana Goswami. The body of Sanatana Goswami was filled with all kinds of sores due to drinking bad water in the forest of Jarikhanda. He was feeling very distressed that Lord Caitanya repeatedly seemed inclined to touch his body.\n\n\n\tLord Caitanya was trying to explain to him, \"No. Your body is completely transcendental. Try to understand. Embracing your body is completely like nectar for me. I relish embracing your body. Even if your body was material, which it's not, in the material conception of life we should not think about good and bad.\" One verse is quoted from the Srimad Bhagavatam that anything that is not conceived in relationship to Krsna is understood to be illusion. None of the illusions either conceived in the mind or spoken by word are factual. Since illusions are not factual, there is no difference between what we think is good and what we think is bad. But when we think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead such speculations do not apply. Then He says this verse:\n\n\n\t'dvaite\u2019 bhadr\u0101bhadra-j\u00f1\u0101na saba-manodharma\n\t\u2018ei bh\u0101la ei manda\u2019\n\tei saba bhrama\n\n\n\tWe should not think in terms of this is good and this is bad, when we think of it in relationship to the happiness and distress of the material world.\n\n\n\tTherefore Srila Prabhupada has made a very interesting point in this commentary. He says that the devotee accepts the distress of this material world with happiness, only due to the causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He is not speaking about material happiness. We have already spoken about material happiness and material distress in the world of dualities. The devotee who has transcended the world of dualities knows that both the happiness and distress of this world are both miserable conditions of life. He wants nothing to do with the happiness and distress of the material world.\n\n\n\tRupa Goswami, in the Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, has defined three types of happiness. Happiness which is derived from sense enjoyment, happiness which is derived from liberation or from relief from the suffering of the material world, and happiness derived from devotional service. The happiness derived from devotional service is superior to the other forms of happiness. A devotee can accept the distress of this material world as happiness when he receives the causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada then quotes the verse by Prabhodananda Sarasvati Thakura:\n\n\n\tkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-purakasa-puspayate durdantendriya-kala sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate\n\tyat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah\n\n\n\tAnyone who receives the merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, then the conception of liberation, for him, is like hell. kaivalyam narakayate. And the pleasures of the heavenly world are like a dream. Such is the nature of the heavenly pleasures of the heavenly planets. Then he says that the venomous serpents of the senses will become like serpents with broken fangs. They will no longer have any poisonous effect. When the venomous fangs of the serpent are broken, they cannot strike on an object and have a poisonous effect whatsoever. visvam purna-sukhayate The whole universe becomes ecstatic. The positions of demigods are like positions of insects. This is the result of obtaining the merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\n\n\tOf course, that merciful glance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is also made accessible to everyone by the manifestation of His holy names. As we know, the nature of Krsna's name is\n\n\n\tn\u0101ma cint\u0101ma\u1e47i\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u015b\n\tcaitanya-rasa-vigraha\u1e25\n\tp\u016br\u1e47a\u1e25 \u015buddho nitya-mukto\n\t\u2019bhinnatv\u0101n n\u0101ma-n\u0101mino\u1e25\n\n\n\tThe holy name of Krsna is completely transcendental. It bestows all spiritual benedictions because it is Krsna Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not a material name under any circumstance. It is as powerful as Krsna, Himself. It is always eternal and liberated. This is the nature of Krsna's name. Krsna has so kindly made Himself accessible in His names.\n\n\n\tkali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara nama haite haya sarva-jagat-nistara\n\n\n\tIn the age of Kali, Krsna has manifested Himself in His name. For anyone who associates with His name, it's as good as associating with Him directly. Certainly, he is delivered. So the Lord has very kindly made Himself accessible to everyone in the form of His name.\n\n\n\tAs Srila Prabhupada explains in the commentary, and a very important point, that by His personal behavior, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed that He was never distressed, but always happy in chanting the Hare Krsna Mahamantra. One should follow in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and engage constantly in chanting His names. Lord Caitanya came to teach by His example. By His example, He showed that he was always relishing the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. By relishing it, He was making the sweet taste of Krsna's name available to others.\n\n\n\tThis was Lord Caitanya's method of distributing the holy name. This was Lord Nityananda's method of distributing the holy name. This method of distributing the holy name was by first relishing it Himself, and then giving its sweet taste to others. Right here, Lord Caitanya in the house of Srivasa Thakura, would relish the holy names of the Lord every night in the association of His most confidential associates. Those who were not His confidential associates were not allowed to participate. But then after relishing the taste of these sweet names with His associates, He, along with His associates, went out and distributed that sweet taste to others.\n\n\n\tSimilarly, all of us have gathered to relish the sweet taste of Krsna's names here in the association of devotees. But as servants of the holy name, we should never try to selfishly relish that sweet taste ourselves. Our duty is to go out and to give it to others. That is the auspiciousness of this event that has been created for all of us to take part into go together and to relish these sweet names. If we adopt the mood so nicely described by His Holiness Sacinandana Maharaja yesterday in his wonderful Srimad Bhagavatam class, of thinking of our- selves as very fallen and very much in need of mercy, and by qualifying ourselves in some way by prayer, intense chanting, and absorption, for the Lord to come down and to extend that mercy to us.\n\n\n\tThis is how we should be very eager to obtain the darshan of the Lord. Not that we should be so eager to see Him, but we should open up and purify our hearts in such a way that He becomes very eager to see us. He will come and very kindly distribute that mercy to everyone who opens their hearts in sincere prayer and chanting the holy names of the Lord. We should pray to serve the Lord and to please Him. Not only by getting the opportunity to taste the sweet name, but eagerly being given the opportunity to distribute it for the welfare of everyone. This is real service to the holy name.\n\n\n\tThis is what Srila Prabhupada also came to teach by his example.\n\n\n\tThank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n\n","nid":"18597"},{

But when I look at my own qualification for speaking on such an elevated topic as this, I feel very unqualified to do so. Who am I to speak about the glories of Srimati Radharani? If Krsna is so difficult to understand, just imagine how difficult it is to understand Radharani?\n\n\n\tUnless one gets a drop of mercy from Krsna's lotus feet we can never understand Krsna's greatness. So what to speak of understanding Srimati Radharani's greatness.\n\n\n\tRadharani is the embodiment of mercy and compassion. It is one of Her qualities. She is Krsna's compassion personified because She has Krsna under Her control and She can claim possession of Krsna. She can say Krsna is Mine. So anyone who can say, \"Krsna is Mine\" has the power to give Krsna to others and there is nobody who can stake a claim that \"Krsna is Mine\" more than Srimati Radharani. She knows how to please Krsna better than anyone.\n\n\n\tThere is a verse in Caitanya Caritamrita:\n\tgovindanandini radha, govinda-mohini\n\tgovinda-sarvasva, sarva-kanta-siromani\n\t(Caitanya Caritamrita, Adi 4.82)\n\n\n\t\u201cRadha, She is the one who can please Krsna. And She is the one who completely enchants Krsna. She is the be-all and end-all of Govinda. And She is the crest jewel of all of Krsna's consorts.\u201d\n\n\n\tSo because She has the capacity to serve Krsna in the greatest way, which means that Her service is most pleasing to Him, then if anyone could have any hope of doing something that would be pleasing to Krsna, an intelligent person should be thinking, \"Let me try to get Srimati Radharani's attention. Let me do something that would assist her in pleasing Krsna because who am I to please Krsna?\"\n\tI think it was Tamal Krsna Maharaja, who once told the following story about Prabhupada. Prabhupada was looking at a painting of the gopis for a new publication. While gazing at the picture, he was expressing how pleased he was with it. It was picture of all the gopis standing in the background and they are pushing Radharani forward. Prabhupada said, \"Yes. This is very nice. This is how a devotee thinks. How to push others forward.\" In other words, these gopis don't even want to be directly connected to Krsna. Their greatest happiness is connecting Radharani with Krsna. And if they can always be in the background doing this, they have no greater pleasure than this.\n\n\n\tSo Prabhupada was saying, \"Yes. This is the mood of a devotee.\" He was very pleased with the painting. He said, \"We should always be eager stay in the background and push others forward in their service to Krsna.\"\u00a0But Radharani is so merciful, so magnanimous, that She gets a pleasure ten million times greater by making different arrangements to bring the gopis to Krsna\u2026 a pleasure even greater than Herself being personally present with Krsna.\n\n\n\tnana-cchale krsne preri' sangama karaya\n\tatma-krsna-sanga haite koti-sukha paya\n\n\n\t\"Presenting various pleas for the gopis, Srimati Radharani sometimes sends the gopis to Krsna just to enable them to associate with Him directly. At such times, She enjoys a happiness ten million times greater than that enjoyed through direct association.\" (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 8.213)\n\n\n\tSo just consider how magnanimous She is. And just consider, how could Radharani get a pleasure ten million times greater than being directly with Krsna unless Krsna was pleased with Her service?\n\tSo this is how magnanimous Radharani is. Although the gopis always want to stay in the background and bring Radharani to Krsna because She knows how to please Krsna the best, and She definitely pleases Krsna the best, still She is pleased even more by making different arrangements to have the gopis meet with Krsna too.\n\n\n\tTherefore, in this way, She is most merciful and very compassionate.\n\n\n\tI was just looking at this before I came. Prabhupada says in the \"Nectar of Devotion\" about compassion. He is talking about Krsna's compassion. And he described how Krsna's compassion was exhibited before Bhismadeva.\n\n\n\tWhen Bhisma was lying on his bed of arrows, Krsna forgot His own position. He was so eager to come before Bhismadeva that He just completely forgot His own position as the Supreme Lord and hastily went to be before him as he was passing from this world.\n\n\n\tWhen Krsna saw Bhisma's pitiable condition, He began to speak with tears in His eyes. And Prabhupada said that He also forgot Himself in His compassion. He says, \"Therefore instead of offering obeisances to Krsna directly, devotees offer obeisances to His compassionate nature.\" (NOD, Chapter 22)\n\n\n\tBecause Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is very difficult to approach Him. But the devotees, taking advantage of His compassionate nature which is represented by Radharani, always pray to Radharani for Krsna's compassion.\n\n\n\tSo Prabhupada is explaining that Radharani is the representative, of Krsna's compassion. Therefore, if we are thinking that we want to do something that is pleasing to Krsna, and if we want to give something to Krsna, then it is considered to be better to go to Radharani, and give it to her and say, \"Can you please recommend me to Krsna?\" If Radharani recommends someone to Krsna, Krsna can't refuse. She controls Krsna. How can He refuse if Radharani recommends?\n\n\n\tFor instance, Krsna says, \"if you offer Me a leaf, flower, fruit, or water, with love and devotion, I will accept.\" But if we have a flower or leaf and give it to Srimati Radharani, asking, \"Can you please offer this to Krsna?\" then what better way to give something to Krsna and to get recognized if Radharani makes some recommendation on our behalf?\n\n\n\tPrabhupada also says something very wonderful about Radharani, which I'll repeat here and then I'll end because Candramauli Maharaja is supposed to speak and we are supposed to end by 11:00.\n\tPrabhupada on Radhastami day, he was giving a lecture, obviously about Radharani. So he says,\n\n\n\t\"So our today prayer to Radharani, we pray to Radharani because She is the pleasure potency of Krsna.\" Radharani is the personification of Krsna's pleasure potency.\" (end of quote)\n\n\n\tKrsna He has three primary potencies\u2026.sat, cit, and ananda or His sandhini potency, His samvit potency, and His hladini potency. This sat potency is His aspect of eternality. The personification of His sandhini potency is Lord Balarama. Lord Balarama, creates all the different varieties of the spiritual world. And whatever is created, has some form. All the form and all of the varieties of the spiritual world are manifest by Balarama, who assists the Lord in this way. And therefore He is the personification of this sandhini potency.\n\n\n\tThe samvit potency is knowledge. Sat, cit, knowledge, and ananda. So the personification of the cit potency is Krsna Himself. And another manifestation of knowledge in the spiritual world is to know what is our relationship with Krsna. That is called sambandha. Sambandha means to know what is my relationship with Krsna. But this samvit potency in the spiritual world, is manifest by knowing that \"Krsna is my friend.\" Balarama thinks, \"Krsna is My brother.\" Yasoda thinks, \"Krsna is my son.\" That is the perfect manifestion of the samvit potency. Their knowledge is complete. They don't need to know anything else. They don't even know how great they are. All they know is their ecstasy in knowing Krsna. That's all. As \"my friend,\" \"my lover,\" \"my son.\"\n\n\n\tIn fact, their knowledge is considered to be the highest knowledge. The highest knowledge is called jnana sunya. Do you know what jnana sunya means? Anyone know? Manjari knows. Zero knowledge. Right. The highest knowledge is that they have no knowledge. That's the highest. Imagine. There are different methods of obtaining knowledge through different stages. For instance, there is pratyaksa, obtaining knowledge through sense perception. And then there is receiving knowledge through hearing. And then there's the knowledge that's received through realization. Then there's platform which is called adhoksaja, which is the knowledge gained by understanding the expanse of the spiritual world. We can't obtain that adhoksaja by mental speculation. Neither can we force it to be manifest, to be revealed in our hearts. It is manifest only by divine mercy. And therefore we can only pray to qualify for that mercy to be able to understand the expanse of the spiritual world.\n\n\n\tBut that's not the highest. There's another platform which is even higher. It is called kevala, or jnana sunya. It means to have no knowledge. To be completely devoid of the knowledge of Krsna's aisvarya, which are His opulences. To not know that Krsna is God. To even hear it suggested is a disturbance.\n\n\n\tWhen Uddhava tried to suggest to Nanda Maharaja about the glories of his son, Nanda Maharaja objected. He said, \"What are you trying to say? My son is God? What do you take me for? How could He be God? Every morning He carries my shoes on His head? How could you say He's God? God is the Supreme Absolute Truth. I've never seen anyone who lies better than my son.\"\n\n\n\tNanda Maharaja really objects. He says to Uddhava, \"You're trying to make me feel better by telling me how great a son I have, but you're making me miserable. All I know is that He's my son and I miss Him. Where did He go? Doesn't He remember His parents? Wherever I go, all I see is my son. I leave the house to try to forget about Him, but I see the forest, I see the pasturing grounds, I see the cows, but all this makes me think of my son.\"\n\n\n\tThis is what Nanda Maharaja knows. That's all he needs to know. Jnana sunya. He knows nothing about Krsna's opulences. All he knows is that \"Krsna is my son.\"\n\n\n\tSo this is the samvit potency. This is the most complete knowledge to have. And Radharani, She is the personification of Krsna's hladini potency. When Krsna wants to enjoy\u2026 of course Prabhupada always explains that when we use this word \"when\" it could be quite confusing. Because as soon as we say \"when\" it suggests that there is some beginning point. What do you mean, \"When Krsna wants to enjoy?\" Never is there a time when He is not enjoying. So how can we say, \"when\" Krsna wants to enjoy? But we have to say it. But please try to understand, Krsna is always enjoying.\n\n\n\tSo when Krsna enjoys, He can't enjoy anything of this material world. There is nothing in this world that's attractive to Him. When He comes to world, He is not attracted to anything in this world.\n\n\n\tWe were just speaking the other day about this in class. Prabhupada said that when Krsna comes to deliver the sadhus, he was quoting the verse paritranaya sadhunam, vinasaya ca duskritam. So he said that \"actually Krsna doesn't come to deliver the sadhus because the sadhus are already delivered.\" And then he explained who is a sadhu. He said that \"the sadhu is not merely a worldly moralist. The sadhu is a devotee. And a devotee \"sa gunan samatityaitan\" (Bg 14.26) A devotee is above the modes of material nature. He is not in the modes of material nature. He is already transcendental.\n\n\n\tSo how can we say that Krsna is coming to deliver the sadhus? The sadhus are already delivered. He says therefore that when Krsna comes, He is coming for some inner purpose. He wants to satisfy the innermost desires of His devotees. He wants to allow Himself to be seen by them. And therefore He comes for that purpose. Because the devotees' hearts are already completely pure.\n\tTherefore when Krsna comes, He comes, not because He has any interest in this material world. Because there is nothing material that can attract Him. Only His devotee can attract Him.\n\tBut which devotee can attract Krsna more than Radharani? So She is the personification of Krsna's pleasure potency. And therefore Prabhupada is saying here:\n\n\n\t\"We pray to Radharani because She is the pleasure potency of Krsna. Krsna means \"all-attractive.\" But Radharani is so great that She attracts Krsna. Krsna is all-attractive, and She is attractive [attractor] of Krsna. So what is the position of Srimati Radharani? We should try to understand this day and offer our obeisances to Radharani. Radhe vrndavanesvari.\n\n\n\ttapta-kancana-gaurangi radhe vrndavanesvari\n\tvrsabhanu-sute devi pranamami hari-priye\n\n\n\tOur business is 'Radharani, You are so dear to Krsna. You are the daughter of King Vrsabhanu and You are so dear to Krsna. So we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.'\n\n\n\ttapta-kancana-gaurangi radhe vrndavanesvari\n\tvrsabhanu-sute devi pranamami hari-priye\n\n\n\t[I offer my respects to Radharani, whose bodily complexion is like molten gold and who is the Queen of Vrndavana. You are the daughter of King Vrsabhanu, and You are very dear to Lord Krsna.]\n\n\n\tRadharani is hari-priya, very dear to Krsna. So if we approach Krsna through Radharani, through the mercy of Radharani, then it becomes very easy. If Radharani recommends that 'This devotee is very nice,' then Krsna immediately accepts, however fool I may be.\" (Radhastami -- London, August 29, 1971)\n\n\n\tThat's the part that really struck me. I had to lead up to that point. We tend to think \"I have to be something pretty great for Radharani to recommend me.\" But Prabhupada is saying, no, however much of a fool I may be, Krsna will accept. That is her magnanimity. She is the topmost mahabhagavata. She thinks everyone is serving Krsna except Herself.\n\n\n\tSo even if I'm the greatest fool and even if we have no qualification, if somehow we can can just make an appeal to Her, pray for Her mercy, do something, anything that could possibly please Her.\n\tRadharani is not going to recognize us by some external show. These things don't attract Her. But if we want to do something to assist Her in pleasing Krsna, we must remember that She is magnanimity personified. And of course, the greatest manifestation of Her mercy is found in Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Who is Krsna Himself, and Who accepted the bhava, the mood of Radharani.\n\n\n\tSo Prabhupada is explaining this point here. He says, \"However fool I may be, if we try to catch Radharani's mercy it will be very easy.\"\n\n\n\tPrabhupada continues, \"Therefore in Vrndavana you'll find all the devotees, they're chanting more Radharani's name than Krsna's. Wherever you'll go, you'll find the devotees are addressing, \"Jaya Radhe.\" You'll find still in Vrndavana. They are glorifying Radharani. They're more interested, worshiping Radharani. Because however fallen I may be, if some way or other I can please Radharani, then it is very easy for me to understand Krsna.\"\n\n\n\tSo we should meditate on Radharani in this way. We should meditate on Her mercy and her magnanimity and her compassion. And her mood. Her mood, is \"let Me bring others forward to please Krsna.\"\n\n\n\tgopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah\n\t(Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 13.80)\n\n\n\t\"I identify Myself only as the servant of the servant of the servant of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, the maintainer of the gopis.\"\n\n\n\tThis is the proper mood. To bring others forward. And Radharani gets a pleasure ten million times greater by bringing others forward in their relationship with Krsna. This is how we can get Radharani's attention. It's not so cheap. It's not that you can just raise your hands and get attention. If you want to get Her attention, then understand Her mood. \"Let others go forward. Let me stay behind. Let me bring them forward. Let me please Her and let me stay even farther behind. She knows. She will recognize.\" We will get Her mercy.\n\n\n\tIn this way, if we remember this on this auspicious day, and remember Her magnanimity and compassion and Her mercy, then even an unqualified fool can remember something about Radharani.\n\n\n\tOK? It's 11:00. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n\n","nid":"14122"},{

Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.\n\n\n\tPURPORT\n\tHearing discussions among the devotees is the only means to receive the powerful message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For instance, Bhagavad-gita has been well known all over the world for a very long time, especially in the Western world, but because the subject matter was not discussed by devotees, there was no effect. Not a single person in the West became Krsna conscious before the Krsna consciousness movement was founded. But when the same Bhagavad-gita was presented as it is through the disciplic succession, the effect of spiritual realization was immediately manifested.\n\n\n\tSanat-kumara, one of the Kumaras, informed Prthu Maharaja that his meeting with the Kumaras benefited not only Maharaja Prthu but the Kumaras as well. When Narada Muni questioned Lord Brahma about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Brahma thanked Narada Muni for giving him a chance to speak about the Supreme Lord. Therefore questions put by a saintly person to another saintly person about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about the ultimate goal of life surcharge everything spiritually. Whoever takes advantage of such discussions is benefited both in this life and in the next.\n\n\n\tThe word ubhayesam can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the materialist and the transcendentalist. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and transcendentalist are benefited. The materialist is benefited by association with devotees because his life then becomes regulated so that his chance of becoming a devotee or making the present life successful for understanding the real position of the living entity is increased. When one takes advantage of this opportunity, he is assured of a human form of life in the next birth, or he may be liberated completely and go back home, back to Godhead. The conclusion is that if one participates in a discussion of devotees, he is both materially and spiritually benefited. The speaker and the audience are both benefited, and the karmis and jnanis are benefited. The discussion of spiritual matters amongst devotees is beneficial for everyone, without exception. Consequently the Kumaras admitted that not only was the King benefited by such a meeting, but the Kumaras were as well.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\n\n\tThis verse is part of the conversation between Sanat-kumara and Prithu Maharaja. The Four Kumaras appeared before Prithu Maharaja and Prithu Maharaja, immediately recognizing their identities, took advantage of their presence by inquiring from them. He said, \"There's no need to ask about your good and bad fortune because you're always absorbed in bliss. Therefore I'm going to take advantage of your presence and ask you about how I can attain good fortune.\n\n\n\tPrithu Maharaja had inquired from the sages, \"Persons entangled in this dangerous material existence because of their previous actions, could such persons, whose only aim is sense gratification, be blessed with good fortune?\" That was his question\u2026 a very relevant question. He's taking the humble position of a person entangled in a web of sense gratification by asking, \"How can I attain any good fortune in his life?\"\n\n\n\tSanat-kumara replied, \"Thank you\", and then says, \"I've been very nicely questioned by you. Such questions are beneficial for all living entities especially because they are asked by you, because you're always thinking of everyone else's welfare. Although you know everything you ask such questions because that is the behavior of saintly persons.\"\n\n\n\tWe see this exchange in many places of the Bhagavatam where the Bhagavatam speakers express their gratitude to the audience.\n\n\n\tmunayah sadhu prsto 'ham\n\tbhavadbhir loka-mangalam\n\tyat krtah krsna-samprasno\n\tyenatma suprasidati\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\tO sages, I have been justly questioned by you. Your questions are worthy because they relate to Lord Krsna and so are of relevance to the world's welfare. Only questions of this sort are capable of completely satisfying the self. (SB 1.2.5)\n\n\n\tSuta Goswami thanked his audience for asking relevant questions in the same way as Sanat-kumara is thanking Prithu Maharaja. \"Thank you for asking how to obtain good fortune. And although you say that you don't have to inquire about my good fortune because you see that our status is always auspicious, I can see that not only is my status auspicious, but your status is auspicious too because you are interested in hearing such topics.\n\n\n\tTherefore today's verse explains the essence of Sanat-kumara's answer to Prithu Maharaja. \"When there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers, become conclusive to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.\"\n\tWhen the sages of Naimasaranya gathered to perform a sacrifice, they were performing a sacrifice for the benefit of the entire world. What was their sacrifice?...hearing Srimad Bhagavatam. It's not that they sat in front a sacrificial fire, poured ghee into the fire and then expected that that was sufficient to benefit all humanity. They performed the ultimate sacrifice for this age. They gathered to hear, to discuss, and to glorify the topics related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that's why Suta Goswami was so pleased by their questions.\n\n\n\tThe sages of Naimasaranya began the sacrifice by asking, \"What is the supreme occupation for all mankind? In other words, \"What dharma should all living beings engage in? The answer was the famous verse:\n\n\n\tsa vai pumsam paro dharmo\n\tyato bhaktir adhoksaje\n\tahaituky apratihata\n\tyayatma suprasidati\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\tThe supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self. (SB 1.2.6)\n\n\n\tSo the only solution for satisfying the hankering, or the needs, of the eternal soul is to establish his connection with the Supreme.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada explains in a Bhagavad-gita commentary that the living entities in the material world suffer due to want of an ultimate goal in life. Without establishing an ultimate goal, people will continue to aspire for the fulfillment of so many lesser goals and will still not feel sheltered upon receiving the fruits of their efforts.\n\n\n\tIn other words, the only way the self can be perfectly sheltered and satisfied is by being fully engaged in devotional service to the Lord. And what is the means for obtaining devotional service? If devotional service is the ultimate goal, is the only activity which can satisfy the hankering soul, then a person should become eager to know how to obtain it.\n\n\n\tIn the conversation between Lord Caitanya and Ramananda Raya, Ramananda Raya answers this question:\n\n\n\tkrsna-bhakti-rasa-bhavita matih\n\tkriyatam yadi kuto 'pi labhyate\n\ttatra laulyam api mulyam ekalam\n\tjanma-koti-sukrtair na labhyate\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\t\"\u2018Pure devotional service in Krsna consciousness cannot be had even by pious activity in hundreds and thousands of lives. It can be attained only by paying one price -- that is, intense greed to obtain it. If it is available somewhere, one must purchase it without delay.'\" (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 8.70)\n\n\n\tOne has to develop a greed to have it. There is no other way to obtain it. If one doesn't become greedy to have it, it's not going to just immediatley fall from the sky and immediately transform our hearts. Therefore when one obtains the association of a devotee of the Lord, that association is called divine grace. That's why we refer to Srila Prabhupada as \"His Divine Grace.\" By His Divine Grace, even a person who previously had no inclination for devotional service can immediately develop an attraction to obtain it.\n\n\n\tThat desire is awakened in the heart. It's already there, but it needs to be awakened.\n\n\n\tnitya-siddha krsna-prema \u2018sadhya' kabhu naya\n\tsravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\t\"Pure love for Krsna is eternally established in the hearts of the living entities. It is not something to be gained from another source. When the heart is purified by hearing and chanting, this love naturally awakens. (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 22.107)\n\n\n\tOnce it's awakened, what does one have to do? Once it's awakened, one has to make some effort. It's not only by the effort of somebody else.\n\n\n\tFor example, if you have a very important engagement on a particular day, and somebody comes and wakes you up, \"It's time to get up.\"\n\n\n\t\"Oh, I'm so tired.\"\n\n\n\tAnd they come back again, \"Prabhu it's time to get up.\"\n\n\n\t\"Oh I'm just so tired, so tired.\"\n\n\n\tEven modern society takes all this into consideration. Now all alarm clocks always have a \"snooze\" button. Isn't it? Every morning, they can count how many times they hit the snooze button. \"Five more minutes. I can get five more minutes.\" Then after five minutes passes, they think, \"Well I can get five more. Why not?\"\n\n\n\tSo either somebody comes and shakes you every five minutes or your alarm goes off every five minutes, but you have an important event that day. Once somebody wakes you up, you have to make the effort to stay awake. Whether it's your alarm clock or somebody else coming and waking you, you still have to make the effort, \"OK. I'm going to get up, and I'm going to take a cold shower. And then I'm going to stick my hand in my bead bad and stay awake.\"\n\n\n\tIsn't it? The first thing we do when we wake up in the morning is offer our obeisances to our spiritual master. Then we have to make the effort to stay awake.\n\n\n\tLord Caitanya is calling, \"Jiv Jago, Jiva Jago. Wake up sleeping souls. How long are you going to sleep on the lap of the witch called Maya.\" So Lord Caitanya is making the call to everybody, \"Wake up!\" He's making the first call. \"OK. Time to wake up.\" But are we going to expect him to keep on coming back to say, \"Wake up. Wake up\"\u2026 again and again and again. He's got better things to offer you than to tell you to wake up.\n\n\n\tWe have to make the effort to stay awake and therefore that effort is our responsibility. How to stay awake. So by the mercy of \"His Divine Grace\", he wakes up the sleeping soul. He tells us that we are the eternal servants of Krsna. Our constitutional nature is to render pure, loving, unmotivated, devotional service to Him. And then he has so many more things to tell us after we're awake\u2026 about how to stay awake. How to realize our actual spiritual identity. That realization awakens in those who are eager to obtain it. We have to make the effort.\n\n\n\tatah sri-krsna-namadi\n\tna bhaved grahyam indriyaih\n\tsevonmukhe hi jihvadau\n\tsvayam eva sphuraty adah\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\t\"\u2018Therefore material senses cannot appreciate Krsna's holy name, form, qualities and pastimes. When a conditioned soul is awakened to Krsna consciousness and renders service by using his tongue to chant the Lord's holy name and taste the remnants of the Lord's food, the tongue is purified, and one gradually comes to understand who Krsna really is.' (Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 17.136)\n\n\n\tKrsna can only be understood by spiritual senses which become purified, beginning with the tongue. When the tongue is used for discussing transcendental topics about the Lord, then either by speaking about Krsna or by inquiring about Krsna, we can then take responsibility. We might say, \"I'm not Krsna conscious.\" But then you can inquire about Krsna. That's exactly what is happening right here in this exchange between Prithu Maharaja and Sanat-kumara.\n\n\n\tPrithu Maharaja took the position of being very fallen and engrossed in sense\u00a0 gratification and he said, \"This is a very dangerous material existence because I'm entangled because of my previous actions in this material existence. How can any person who is so entangled in sense gratification have any good fortune in life? How can they be blessed with good fortune?\"\n\n\n\tSo he took the position of asking, although he could have spoken. All realization was there but he took the position of asking. And Sanat-kumara says, \"Oh thank you so much. You are helping me. I'll benefit from this opportunity. You're engaging me in devotional service.\" He was so grateful. \"You're so merciful that you are giving me an opportunity to speak about transcendental topics. I know I can't speak about anything else because you're not interested in hearing anything else. I'm so grateful. I know I won't get away with talking about Maya to you because you don't want to hear anything about Maya. You are so kind. For my benefit you've asked this question. Thank you.\"\n\n\n\tTherefore both the speaker and the hearer, they benefit because the only topic is transcendental subject matter.\n\n\n\tThere are many things that I wanted to speak about this morning but we have a schedule to follow today. I want to end at the appropriate time, at 9:00. I was going to read this later, but I'll read it now because I want to make sure it's read. It's a very wonderful verse from the fifth canto of the Bhagavatam. I really like it. It's spoken by Jada Bharata to Maharaja Rahugana.\n\n\n\t\"Who are the pure devotees mentioned here? In an assembly of pure devotees, there is no question of discussing material subjects like politics and sociology. In an assembly of pure devotees, there is discussion only of the qualities, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is praised and worshiped with full attention. In the association of pure devotees, by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vasudeva.\"\n\n\n\tPURPORT\n\tThe symptoms of pure devotees are described in this verse. The pure devotee is never interested in material topics. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has strictly prohibited His devotees to talk about worldly matters. Gramya-varta na kahibe: [Cc. Antya 6.236] one should not indulge in talking unnecessarily about news of the material world. One should not waste time in this way. This is a very important feature in the life of a devotee. A devotee has no other ambition than to serve Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Krsna consciousness movement was started to engage people twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord and in His glorification. The students in this institution engage in the cultivation of Krsna consciousness from five in the morning to ten at night. They actually have no opportunity to waste their time unnecessarily by discussing politics, sociology and current events. These will go their own way. A devotee is concerned only with serving Krsna positively and seriously. [End of purport] (SB 5.12.13)\n\n\n\tThese will go their own way! In other words, they will go on anyways and it will be their own way. Of course, someone might say, \"Well this verse is speaking about an assembly of pure devotees, but I'm not a pure devotee.\" But we already established that the only real solution to the problems of life is to become purified. Any effort we make to try to counteract one fruitive activity by another fruitive activity is going to entangle us further. That's exactly what material life is. Material life is a constant endeavor to counteract reactions to past sinful life. And that's why Prithu Maharaja said, \"I'm a sense gratifier and my current situation is simply the result of my previous activities.\"\n\n\n\tHe didn't say, \"How do I counteract the results of my previous activities?\" That's how materialists think. How to avoid suffering to obtain happiness and to mitigate distress. Prahlada Maharaja explains:\n\n\n\t\"In this material world, every materialist desires to achieve happiness and diminish his distress, and therefore he acts accordingly. Actually, however, one is happy as long as one does not endeavor for happiness; as soon as one begins his activities for happiness, his conditions of distress begin.\u201d (SB 7.7.42)\n\n\n\tAn intelligent person should try to stop the cycle. Not \"How do I counteract my past sinful reactions so that I can be [so-called] happy now.\" This happiness is temporary. Therefore Lord Rsabhadeva instructed his sons, instead one should look for \"brahma saukhyam\", real happiness, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.\n\n\n\tAn intelligent person looks for the real solution. He becomes greedy for attaining the opportuinty to hear about Krsna, the only solution. Therefore when devotees get together, they utilize their time to its full potential. They don't waste time discussing politics, sociology and current events. These will go their own way!! They are going to go their own way. Why should we waste time discussing these things? No solution comes by discussing these things! They will still go their own way. Better I become Krsna conscious. Better I get together to discuss topics related to Krsna. It's in my hands. It's my responsibility to utilize my life wisely. In other words, it's my responsibilitiy to stay awake!\n\n\n\tCertainly by \"divine grace\" somebody will come and tell us to wake up. Don't stay sleeping in the lap of the witch called Maya. But how to stay awake? The way to stay awake is to utilize this human life to it's full potential\u2026 and the best opportunity for this is in the association of devotees. A devotee will be eager to ask, \"Please, can you tell me something Krsna conscious?\" And we should say, \"Thank you. You saved me. My tendency would have been to talk nonsense but you saved me by asking the right question.\n\n\n\tThen when devotees become inspired in this way, what is the result? Prabhupada explains that in the commentary today. He says,\n\n\n\t\"The word ubhayesam can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the materialist and the transcendentalist. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and transcendentalist are benefited.\"\n\n\n\tIn other words, when devotees become inspired by topics about the Supreme Lord, then anybody who comes in contact with such discussions can also obtain divine grace. Devotees can be carriers of divine grace. Materialists become devotees by association with such devotees.\n\n\n\tBoth the devotees are benefitted and the materialists are benefitted. Or as it is stated in verse that we just read from the fifth canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, \"Even the impersonalists become devotees. The verse states that, \"\u2026by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vasudeva.\"\n\n\n\tSo therefore when the sages asked their question to Suta Goswami, \"What is the supreme sacrifice, or highest activity, meant to benefit all humanity?\", the sages then performed that sacrifice by sitting and hearing the topics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who comes in contact with such discussions are reminded of the need to wake up. Once awake, they then become eager to stay awake.\n\n\n\tThat's why it's so important for devotees to regularly come together to discuss transcendental topics. When devotees come together, sometimes they think, \"What are we going to do with each other? Should we play football? That will keep us all engaged. Good exercise. What else? There must be other things that we can think of to keep us busy so that we don't fall into maya.\"[Devotees laugh]\n\n\n\tIt's so clear. Well someone may say, \"Well I don't have any taste for that. Well then Bhagavatam states that one should seek out the association of devotees who will give you some taste.\n\n\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi\n\tsarva-sanga-vivarjitah\n\tsangas tesv atha te prarthyah\n\tsanga-dosa-hara hi te\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\tO My mother, O virtuous lady, these are the qualities of great devotees who are free from all attachment. You must seek attachment to such holy men, for this counteracts the pernicious effects of material attachment. (SB 3.25.24)\n\n\n\tThe pernicious effects of material attachments will be counteracted and a natural taste will awaken. But even if I still don't have taste, Krsna says in the Bhagavad-gita, that a sages should act for his own purification.\n\n\n\t\"The yogis, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification.\" (Bg 5.11)\n\n\n\tAn intelligent person will therefore think, \"Yes. Even though I don't have a taste, because it's pleasing to Krsna and it's pleasing to the Vaisnavas, I'll do it for my own purification.\"\n\n\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya\n\tvasudeva-katha-rucih\n\tsyan mahat-sevaya viprah\n\tpunya-tirtha-nisevanat\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\tO twice-born sages, by serving those devotees who are completely freed from all vice, great service is done. By such service, one gains affinity for hearing the messages of Vasudeva. (SB 1.2.16)\n\tAnd what do devotees ask those who serve them to do? What did Prabhupada ask his tender, neophyte followers to do when they came and heard from him in 26 Second Avenue? He took them out and introduced them to giving the holy name to others.\n\n\n\tIn the \"Prabhupada Lilamrita\" there is a wonderful description of the first harinama the devotees went on without Prabhupada. The devotees were just so ecstatic because they were so eager to go back and tell Prabhupada what they did. They couldn't wait. They burst into his room, \"Prabhupada. We went out and we chanted today!\" And Prabhupada was so pleased. Oh yes. Now you are understanding. Now you understand what pleases me. This makes me very happy. You have understood my message. Thank you so much.\n\n\n\tThis is how to serve the devotees. Even if we don't have taste. We do it for our own purification because by serving them, we develop some taste. We benefit and anyone who comes in contact with us benefits. We don't water down. We give the essence because it is the essence which purifies the heart, puts us on the path of pure devotional service and keeps us on the path. It keeps us awake, so that we won't fall back asleep again and forget what the purpose is of this life.\n\n\n\tSo Sanat-kumara is saying, \"Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to speak and then he said, \"This is the solution.\n\n\n\t\"When there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers become conclusive to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.\"\n\tI can't take questions. I know you might have some. I know you must have. But thank you for all of your questions. I'm thanking you even before you ask them. But for those of you who are taking part in the retreat, you know that I left time this afternoon for questions and answers. You can ask them then.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada ki jaya.\n\n","nid":"13472"},{

It's Chapter Six, Verse 32.\n\n\n\tatmaupamyena sarvatra\n\tsamam pasyati yo 'rjuna\n\tsukham va yadi va duhkham\n\tsa yogi paramo matah\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\tHe is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!\n\n\n\tPURPORT\n\tOne who is Krsna conscious is a perfect yogi; he is aware of everyone's happiness and distress by dint of his own personal experience. The cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And the cause of happiness is knowing Krsna to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being, the proprietor of all lands and planets, and the sincerest friend of all living entities. The perfect yogi knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with Krsna. And because one in Krsna consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of Krsna everywhere. Since the perfect yogi tries to broadcast the importance of becoming Krsna conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah (Bg. 18.69). In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is the best yogi because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogi interested only in his personal elevation. The yogi who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward Krsna consciousness.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami:\n\n\n\tI've been finding myself talking a lot about Srila Prabhupada recently. My desire to speak more about him was probably stimulated this year in Mayapura when I read a booklet produced by a committee of our GBC body about Srila Prabhupada's position as the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON. Essentially it was just a wonderful book that established, very conclusively, the meaning of \"Founder-Acarya\u2026 not only based upon Srila Prabhupada's position in ISKCON but also based upon the position of \"Founder-Acarya\" in our sampradaya.\n\n\n\tI was very enlivened after reading this booklet. I read it one day when I was sick and was unable to attend the meetings. It deepened my conviction about the importance of preserving Srila Prabhupada's presence within the International Society for Krsna consciousness.\n\n\n\tThe word \"Acarya\" in Founder-Acarya means that Srila Prabhupada is the ultimate teacher by his own example in ISKCON. Being a perfect teacher by example, therefore, everything he does is instructive because, as followers, we are meant to aspire to strictly follow his example.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada would oftentimes speak about the difference between following in the footsteps and imitating. He would say that following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas means that we follow the same path they themselves walked. It also means to follow their instructions. Therefore, mahajano yena gatah sa panthah....they leave behind instructions by which their followers can traverse the same path as they themselves also traversed.\n\n\n\tImitating means that we try to artificially imitate the position of being fully realized without being fully realized.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada would oftentimes quote the verse,\n\n\n\tyad yad acarati sresthas\n\ttat tad evetaro janah\n\tsa yat pramanam kurute\n\tlokas tad anuvartate\n\n\n\tTRANSLATION\n\tWhatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\n\n\n\tThis is Krsna's instruction in Bhagavad-gita. He explains why He had to also teach by setting an example because if He didn't then the whole world would be put to ruination.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada's instructions were so potent because he did what he was preaching. In English, we have an expression, I don't know if there is a comparable one in Russian, \"He walks his talk.\" In other words, his actions are fully consistent with his words. Because he was so elevated, he would sometimes give an instruction which would seem almost impossible to follow. But his example was always there as the extra strength for us to try.\n\n\n\tWe all experienced that during Srila Prabhupada's manifest presence in our Krsna consciousness movement. Srila Prabhupada was inspiring his followers to become ghostianandis, to preach Krsna consciousness, and not to become concerned simply about one's own enlightenment. There was an overwhelming emphasis on spreading Krsna consciousness and there was an enthusiasm to do so because we always had his example. We may not be Krsna conscious, but we could always preach boldly and strongly that it exists because we could always point to Prabhupada.\n\n\n\tIn one sense it was very simple in those early years because Prabhupada was not only our Founder-Acarya, but he was the only guru. When someone became qualified for initiation, they knew who they were going to be initiated by and who they were going to serve. That gave Srila Prabhupada's followers great strength and conviction to preach his message. We felt Prabhupada was therefore us and was carefully watching to make sure we didn't deviate.\n\n\n\tHe said, \"Don't change the message. Keep it intact.\"\n\n\n\tI remember one lecture when Srila Prabhupada found something in the transcription he was reading which was different from that which he dictated. He became very disturbed. In the lecture Prabhupada said, \"Don't be overintelligent.\" Don't think that you know more or you know better than your spiritual master.\" He said, \"Your potency will be in your ability to simply repeat what I have given to you.\"\n\n\n\tSo we could repeat everything that Prabhupada told us and we always had the full confidence and support that the example was there for others to see. This gave us great strength to preach, and to preach boldly, because Srila Prabhupada always emphasized to preach boldly.\n\n\n\tHe told us to \"Boil the milk and make it thicker.\" In other words, don't compromise. Don't water Krsna consciousness down to something it isn't. Krsna is already all-attractive. Don't ever water Krsna consciousness down.\n\n\n\tI was telling a story to a group of devotees in Kaliningrad the other day. I was remembering one conversation that Srila Prabhupada had... I can't remember what year it was. I think it might have been 1975.\n\n\n\tHe was visited by one well-known yogi at that time. His name was Yogi Bhajan. I never met Yogi Bhajan but in 1971, I was living with a group of people who were his followers. It was before I read Srila Prabhupada's Bhagavad-gita. They used to speak a lot about him to me. But I had no particular appeal or attraction to him.\n\n\n\tAnyway, Prabhupada was visited by this yogi along with two of his secretaries. He came to invite Srila Prabhupada to a conference called the \"Unity of Man\" conference. He was promoting himself as the organizer of the conference and he was inviting and also visiting popular yogis, mystics, saints, and sadhus to extend invitations. He was promoting this conference as if it would benefit all of humanity. So he said, \"We want you to come, Swamiji. Please come and we'll give you a slot and you can speak. Become part of our united effort to save the world.\"\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada tried to explain to him that there's only one way that humanity can be united. He said, \"We can only be united if we surrender to Krsna.\" So he asked, \"Therefore Bhagavad-gita will be preached and Krsna's message will be preached exclusively at the conference?\" And then Yogi Bhajan said, \"Yes. That will be there. But there will be many other sages, mystics and saints and they will give their teachings. In this way we can all be united in harmony, with the same goal.\"\n\n\n\tPrabhupada said, \"No. There's only one goal. Krsna's goal. We have to follow Krsna otherwise how can we become united?\" Prabhupada used the example about the United Nations. He would say that the United Nations means that even though many countries come together, they have their own flag and they represent their own interests. Yhey are mainly interested in their own interests. That's all. So he said that United Nations simply means that there are more flags. Therefore United Nations simply means that we add more flags but there's no real unity because everyone is simply representing their own interests. They want to make sure that their own interests are being secured.\n\n\n\tSo he was expressing this same point to Yogi Bhajan, that actually there is only one interest\u2026 Krsna's interest. So he explained why he didn't want to attend. He said, \"You can have your conference but I will not attend.\"\n\n\n\tBut Yogi Bhajan was a little persistent because he felt that if Prabhupada attended more people would come. Prabhupada didn't want to be used that way. Yogi Bhajan really tried to make it look really nice, \"If you come, it will be so nice, so wonderful, it will be a real good example for the world.\n\n\n\tYogi Bhajan's secretaries were sitting and taking notes. Prabhupada was noticing this as he was speaking. So Prabhupada just turned to Yogi Bhajan and said, \"Write this down in your notebook. Bhaktivedanta Swami says that without Krsna, there will be no unity. Put that in your notebook. Make sure that you write it down.\"\n\n\n\tYoga Bhajan tried one more time by explaining how it would be such a wonderful experience. Prabhupada finished the whole conversation by making one statement. He says, \"If you go into the latrine and you throw scented water on stool, does that make it a nice place?\" Prabhupada was trying to explain, \"That's what you are trying to do. You are trying to make everything a nice place, but without Krsna you cannot make this a nice place.\"\n\n\n\tAt that particular point, one of the people accompanying him got a little incensed, so they got up and they left. Prabhupada simply laughed.\n\n\n\tSomeone may say, \"Why didn't Prabhupada take the opportunity to preach at the event?\" Because\u00a0 he didn't want to compromise Krsna consciousness. He was an uncompromised example of Krsna consciousness.\n\n\n\tThere is another story I like about Prabhupada and his bold preaching.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada was invited in Jagannath Puri to inaugurate a book that one local author had written. Many famous people were there to do the inauguration. So Prabhupada saw this as a very good opportunity to preach boldly because he was very disturbed that his disciples were not being allowed to take darshan of Lord Jagannath. He therefore accepted the invitation although the organizers didn't know that was Prabhupada's intention. The organizers arranged for all the other invited guests to speak about the book first and then Prabhupada was to speak last. So one by one each dignitary came and spoke about the author's book, glorified him, and said things about the book. Prabhupada was then invited to speak.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada immediately began speaking how Lord Jagannath is the Lord of the universe. He's not just Lord of the Hindus, not just Lord of the Indians. He's the Lord of universe. And because He's the Lord of the universe, that means that everyone has a relationship with Lord Jagannath. He gave a very powerful talk about the Lord's position, quoting Bhagavad-gita, aham bija-pradah pita.... Krsna says, \"I am the seed-giving father of all living beings.\"\n\n\n\tSo he was challenging, \"Why are you not allowing Vaisnavas to take darshan of Lord Jagannath?\" He spoke for some time and the organizers were starting to get a little anxious. They were standing on the side and were saying, \"Swamiji, the book. Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada didn't even look at them. He continued like fire. \"Swamiji, Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada just waited until he finished his message. He then looked up at them and they said, \"Swamiji, the book!\" Prabhupada picked up the book and said, \"Oh yes. This book is inaugurated\" and then he threw it on the table and walked off the stage.\n\n\n\tFinished. So bold. He was so bold. He could be bold. Of course Prabhupada even sometimes said to us, he said, \"I can do this because I'm an old man. Don't imitate. Because he would be that way and people would still respect him and listen to him. He would caution us though. He wanted us to preach boldly but to be careful to not imitate.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada was also a gentleman. He would not publicly criticize. Even when people would ask Prabhupada, for example, if they would ask, \"Can you tell me? What is your opinion of Yogi Bhajan?\" And Prabhupada would say, \"What is his philosophy?\" So he would make the person explain what is the philosophy of Yogi Bhajan. I'm using him just as a hypothetical example. But he did it with many people because people would sometimes ask Prabhupada's opinion about... at that time there was a lot... for instance there was Krsnamurti, who was very popular, Guru Maharaji, the so-called \"perfect master\". Then there were so many gods around too. Prabhupada also had to deal with questions about all of these gods. So Prabhupada would ask, \"What is his philosophy?\" Upon hearing the philosophy he would then rip it to pieces. He would expose the impersonal conclusion or whatever misrepresentation of the absolute truth that it was. But he would not openly criticize the individual.\n\n\n\tHe did this a lot with Vivekananda. Although he would not go out of his way to criticize publicly, but he would definitely do it in private conversations and lectures with disciples. If he was asked publicly he would have to defend Krsna. He was always defending Krsna. He was always defending the sampradaya.\n\n\n\tOne time Prabhupada was sitting in a room with Indian people\u2026 I think it was in Bombay. One gentleman was challenging Prabhupada because Prabhupada was using strong words. I think he might have been using \"rascals\" or \"mudhas\". And the man was saying, \"Swamiji, you are supposed to be sama darsinah. Why are you speaking like this?\" Prabhupada replied, \"Oh, sama darsinah? That is a higher platform. I'm not on that platform. I have to discriminate. But I discriminate because I see who is following Krsna's instructions and who is not following Krsna's instructions. And Krsna says, \"avajananti mam mudha\", He says \"na mam duskritino mudha\". He gave examples how Krsna used strong language, \"mudha\". \"So therefore I simply present what Krsna says. I have to discriminate, who follows and who doesn't follow. But I give Krsna's instructions to everyone. In this sense I don't discriminate. This is my sama darsinah. I tell everyone what Krsna says, indiscriminately.\"\n\n\n\tAnd then the man said, \"But Swamiji, what do you do? You are simply repeating what somebody else said. What are you doing?\" Of course, this is Prabhupada's whole mission. Bhagavad-gita AS IT IS. That was his whole mission. His mission was to give Krsna's instruction as Krsna gave it. Therefore he was presenting Krsna's words, explaining what Krsna's words were and then he was teaching by his own example how he would surrender to Krsna's words. Therefore Prabhupada's words had so much potency to change people because he didn't compromise. He gave Krsna's words and he taught by his example, being fully surrendered to Krsna.\n\n\n\tHere was an example of somebody who gave Krsna's instructions and then pushed everybody beyond their own self-imposed limits, whoever was sincere enough and could understand that, \"Yes, he's following. I have to follow too.\"\n\n\n\tPrabhupada would never compromise. That was his compassion. Some people may say, \"Oh, it looks like arrogance. Why wouldn't he compromise for people?\" But that was his compassion. Atmaupamyena sarvatra. That's exactly what this verse is about in Bhagavad-gita.\"He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!\" His compassion was that, \"They can only be saved if they take shelter at Krsna's lotus feet. How can I give anything else? Anything else would be violence.\"\n\n\n\tThis was his compassion because he was fully realized in what is real happiness, and because he saw all living entities as parts and parcels of Krsna, he knew that the only thing that could make them happy is to connect them to Krsna.\n\n\n\tIsopanisad says, \"One who always sees all living entities as spiritual sparks, in quality one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of things. What, then, can be illusion or anxiety for him?\" Srila Prabhupada was never experiencing any material anxiety. He had only one anxiety and that was the sufferings of others. That was his anxiety. Why? Because he was satisfied. He had his connection with Krsna and therefore he didn't need anything from anyone for himself. Thus, he could give Krsna unlimitedly to everyone without compromising.\n\n\n\tTherefore he was a perfect yogi who could see why others were suffering. He knew their source of suffering, as he says right here in this commentary, \"the cause of distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God.\" Prabhupada went right to the root cause.\n\n\n\tSomeone may say, \"Well, there's so many other causes of distress. I could make a big, long list.\" But Prabhupada would go right to the root\u2014 forgetfulness of one's relationship with God\u2014 because as soon as one establishes a connection with the Supreme Lord\u2026 no more birth, no more death. Moreover, whatever distress they may experience in this life is just burning up whatever reactions were left from previous lives, thus finishing their connection with the material world. Isn't that compassion? He felt that kind of compassion and that's why he was so uncompromising. \"How can I give them anything less than Krsna?\" That was his love. That was his equality. That was his kindness.\n\n\n\tSo he gave Krsna uncompromisingly, and he was very careful to preserve that same method of distribution for the future. He therefore taught his followers to give Krsna to others. And he also expected his followers for future generations to preserve his teachings and this example.\n\n\n\tSo even though we may not be fully Krsna conscious, we still have to know what is the goal\u2014 the example that we want to come to ourselves? We cannot imitate complete Krsna consciousness. But at least we must try to come to that platform. And even though we cannot imitate Srila Prabhupada's perfect, Krsna conscious vision of the world, we must keep his method of preaching intact by preserving what he's given to us in its most potent form\u2014 in his books\u2014 without imposing any of our own interpretation.\n\n\n\tEvery page of Bhagavad-gita as it is pure devotional service. Every page of Srimad Bhagavatam is pure devotional service. It's not anything else. It's pure devotional service... beginning, middle and end. Therefore those who are true followers of Srila Prabhupada will keep his message intact. We still have his example. We can still talk about it. We can still remember that example. We should know what that example is. Everyone should know Srila Prabhupada. If you don't know Srila Prabhupada, you're losing. He's the perfect example. Otherwise, how do we know what platform to aspire for unless we have the perfect example? If we don't know, we'll start thinking, \"Oh I could be like this, I could be like that.\" No. He's our Founder-Acarya for all time\u2014 not just for twelve years while he was present on the planet. He's the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON for as long as ISKCON is present.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada was very, very strong on this point. Whenever he saw the slightest discrepancy in being presented without the title \"Founder-Acarya\", he would immediately correct it.\n\n\n\tOne time Srila Prabhupada came to the new BBT headquarters in Los Angeles and in the front there was a sign, \"Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.\" Prabhupada said, \"Where is Founder-Acarya? Why is it not there?\" Devotees were shocked. He wanted to make sure that \"Founder-Acarya\" was on everything. Why? Someone may think it was vanity. No. There was never any pride in Prabhupada. It was his compassion. He wanted to make sure his vision prevailed for the Krsna consciousness movement. Therefore Founder-Acarya had to be everywhere because he wanted to ensure that everyone would be led to Krsna's lotus feet.\n\n\n\tThat is the mission we experienced in his presence. We'd bring everyone to Prabhupada's lotus feet because we were confident he was connecting them to Krsna.\n\n\n\tSo we need that example. Yes. The goal is to find shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna, and the example of how to find shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna is in our Founder-Acarya.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada's books are the foundation of the Krsna consciousness movement. Nobody else's books are as important as Prabhupada's books. When people come to our temples they should immediately see only Prabhupada's books... a grand display. We should be eager, excited, ecstatic, to introduce people to Srila Prabhupada's books.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada's books change lives\u2026 not just during his manifest presence. They are still changing lives and will continue to change lives. There's so many stories about how people's lives have been changed by coming in contact with Prabhupada in his books.\n\n\n\tI like to tell this story. It's a wonderful story. Quite some time back, I was visiting the temple in Montreal. During the visit, I was writing my Vyasa Puja offering to Srila Prabhupada. Usually we have a deadline in order for it to be published in the annual Vyasa Puja book and the deadline was the next day.\n\n\n\tSo I was sitting in my room about to begin writing my Vyasa Puja offering. What oftentimes happens, however, whenever it comes to write a Vyasa Puja offering, I sit there and I go blank for a little while, thinking about what I am going to write. So I was just sitting, looking at the screen thinking, \"Where to start?\" Starting is usually the hardest part. Once I'm started I can get going.\n\n\n\tAll of a sudden there was a knock on the door. It was the Temple President. He said, \"Maharaja, there's a gentleman who came to the temple and there's nobody here. Would you take a little time to talk to him and answer his questions?\"\n\n\n\tSo I said, \"You know. I have one hour right now. And I need this one hour to write my offering in time for the deadline tomorrow. So he said, \"He's probably got just a few questions. I'm sure it won't be very long.\"\n\n\n\tSo I agreed. I went into the temple reception area and there was one man, probably in his 60's. He introduced himself and asked if we could sit down. So I shook his hand and sat down.\n\n\n\tHe then just started talking. \"Do you know that I was the caption of Montreal police back in 1973?\" It might have been 1974. I can't remember exactly the year he told me. \"I was at the airport when your Prabhupada came. I saw him, I looked at him and I could see that here's a very saintly person. For what I know right now about him, I wish I would have just given everything up right then and there and became his disciple.\"\n\n\n\tSo I said, \"Really? How is it that you know more now?\" He then reached in his pocket and pulled out a pocket-sized Bhagavad-gita. This Bhagavad-gita looked like it had been really read a lot. He said, \"You see this Bhagavad-gita? I've read it thirty-two times.\" I said, \"Thirty-two times?\" He said, \"Yes. Thirty-two times and still counting. I don't go anywhere without it. I read it every day. Sometimes I take my wife to the shopping mall and she says, 'I may be awhile and you'll have to wait.' and I say, 'No problem. I've got my Bhagavad-gita. Take as long as you want.' In fact, my wife is shopping right now. But I saw that the temple was so close by that I decided to come. I could read Bhagavad-gita again and again and it's always fresh.\"\n\n\n\tHe then opened the Bhagavad-gita and started reading verses from it, and then he started talking again about Prabhupada. \"He was such a beautiful person. I don't know why I did not become his disciple.\" He started to tell everything that he saw at the airport.\n\n\n\tHe went on talking and talking and I was thinking, \"I thought that I was going to answer some questions but there are no questions being asked. He just wants to talk.\" So I just sat there and was just mystified listening to him.\n\n\n\tAll of a sudden he said, \"Oh, I think my wife is probably ready by now.\" He had been talking for about forty-five minutes mostly about Prabhupada. He got up, went to the door and started to say good-bye. Then he said, \"You know, my wife and I read Prabhupada Lilamrita every night together. She won't read Bhagavad-gita. But I can get her to read Prabhupada Lilamrita. And every night we read about Prabhupada. He then started telling me the latest story he read from Prabhupada Lilamrta.\n\n\n\tThis went on for about another ten to fifteen minutes as he stood by the door with his hand on door knob and the door half-opened. Then he said, \"I really have to go now. It's been nice talking with you\", and he left.\n\n\n\tI probably didn't say more than five words. I looked at my watch and one hour passed. I was thinking, \"Oh no. I lost my one hour!\" I had a program coming up and therefore lost the hour I was hoping to use for writing my Vyasa Puja offering.\n\n\n\tAs it turned out, the next morning I sat down and just wrote the whole story about my meeting with the former Captain, and that was my Vyasa Puja offering. I saw how Krsna just sent him to write my Vyasa Puja offering for me because I couldn't come up with anything myself.\n\n\n\tAnyway, my realization is that Prabhupada is still changing lives. That man was so attached to Prabhupada. It seemed to me that the gateway to the spiritual world will be open to him for the attachment he has to Krsna's pure devotee.\n\n\n\tI could tell so many other stories but the point is that it's so important to make Srila Prabhupada's books available to people. People are hankering to know someone like Prabhupada and we have a responsibility, as his followers, to make sure that Prabhupada is always accessible to everyone. We should be carefrul to never eclipse Srila Prabhupada.\n\n\n\tFor instance how do we make Krsna accessible? We make Krsna accessible by being Krsna conscious. That's how Krsna becomes accessible. The more Krsna conscious we are the more people can make a connection with Krsna. We don't make Krsna accessible by packaging Him in a way that people can't see who Krsna is. We make Krsna accessible by the way Prabhupada made Krsna accessible. He spoke only about Krsna. That's how Krsna became accessible. And he lived only for Krsna. That made Krsna even more accessible.\n\n\n\tSo why shouldn't we make Prabhupada accessible also? We should make him accessible by making sure that everybody has an opportunity to receive his books. Everybody should know what his example is. And everybody should know what his mission is. Krsna. Nothing more, nothing less. The lotus feet of Krsna.\n\n\n\tWhen you have the lotus feet of Krsna, you have everything. Prabhupada says, yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati. (Mundaka Upanisad 1.3) When you have Krsna, you have everything. That's his mission.\n\n\n\tTherefore there's nothing more than Krsna because there is nobody equal to Him and nobody is greater than Him. Krsna is the last stop, the param gatih, the final goal. And we have to establish that goal in the minds of everyone.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada therefore emphasized that there is nothing more than Krsna. And he would never give anything less than Krsna. Uncompromising. Nothing less. That was his compassion. That was his kindness to humanity. Anyone who came in contact with him could feel his compassion. Simply seeing him, tears would come to people's eyes because he was so filled with compassion. Prabhupada would cry, simply to think how people were trying to forget Krsna.\n\n\n\tA devotee once told me a story about Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada was in a car with devotees, driving by a golf course. When he saw the golfers he asked, \"What are they doing?\" He had never seen or heard of golf before. The devotee replied, \"Prabhupada, that's called golf.\" Prabhupada asked, \"What is this golf?\" The devotee said, \"You see that stick there they are holding? They walk around all day and push a little white ball into a hole.\" Prabhupada started to cry, big tears. \"They are doing so much to try to forget Krsna.\" Crying. Para dukha dukhi. That is a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava has that feeling in his heart. He has his connection with Krsna and therefore has everything he needs. He has service to Krsna. There's a purpose for living for him. There's a purpose for everything he does\u2026 for eating, for breathing. He never hankers. He's satisfied in any condition of life. And because he does not suffer, he can feel other's suffering.\n\n\n\tIn this way a person who is self-satisfied and freed from envy can think of others' welfare. Therefore when he sees others forgetting Krsna, he cries. He feels the pain that they won't be happy until they are connected with Krsna.\n\n\n\tThat's what drove Prabhupada to expand the Krsna consciousness movement in the way he did within twelve years. He was sleeping two hours a night and waking up at midnight. He was translating Srimad Bhagavatam until four o'clock in the morning. He would then begin his day, go for his morning walk, give Srimad Bhagavatam class. Even during his morning walk he was preaching to his disciples. Then he would meet people. Everything he did, he did with the burning desire to give Krsna to others.\n\n\n\tWe need that example. It gives us impetus. We should think, \"What am I doing with my life? Let me use whatever strength, whatever wealth, whatever intelligence I have to do something for Prabhupada's mission. I cannot be a miser and waste this life.\"\n\n\n\tPrabhupada is driving us to understand that principle. And if we don't remember Prabhupada and remember his example, we'll so easily forget. We'll think his mission is to become comfortable in life.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada didn't teach that, because he never looked for his own comfort. He never tried. Comfort was offered but he was not interested. He taught how to use all of our energy for spreading Krsna consciousness. He never asked for his own comfort.\n\n\n\tSometimes devotees would give comforts to him. We gave a lecture on Sunday explaining why Prabhupada would sometimes accept it. He accepted only out of compassion. Not because he was interested in his own comfort. He accepted it because he wanted to reciprocate the love of his disciples and take that love and place it to Krsna's lotus feet. But he would never ask for his own comfort. His example was to not be interested in one's own personal comfort. His comfort was giving Krsna to others. That was comfort for his heart because he felt he was using his energy for the hightest purpose.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada concludes this commentary with that point. He says. \"Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogi interested only in his personal elevation. The yogi who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward Krsna consciousness.\"\n\n\n\tThis is what's in Srila Prabhupada's purport. When we read Srila Prabhupada's commentaries, these are the realizations we should be getting. He called his commentaries his personal ecstasies.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada was even one time sitting and reading his own book. When the Fifth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam was brought to him, Prabhupada immediately opened it and began reading it. Devotees said, Prabhupada even you read your own books.\" And Prabhupada said, \"Oh yes. I have not written these books. Krsna has written these books. That's why I am reading them.\n\n\n\tThis is Prabhupada. Krsna on every page.\n\n\n\tSo this is our understanding of this verse:\n\n\n\t\"He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna!\"\n\n\n\tPrabhupada knows how to make others really happy and he knows what the cause of distress is. Just one very simple point. We've simply forgotten Krsna. That is the source of distress.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada used to quote Srila Bhaktisiddhanta. He said that there is nothing lacking in this material world. Everything is available except one thing\u2026 Krsna consciousness. \"Therefore,\" he said, \"I have come to give to Him to you.\"\n\n\n\tHare Krsna.\n\n","nid":"12742"},{

He explains the dangers of not following, the consequences of not following, and the reasons why someone may not follow. So I'm thinking it might be good to read from there. Probably all I have to do is read it because it gives sufficient detail without any need for comment. But we can try to expand on the points he's made and I'm sure that Maharaja will have some comments to share too. Since we have an hour, we can also have a little discussion on the topic. Let's see if we can all benefit from it. So this is in the section entitled \"tat-tat-karma-pravartanat.\"\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tIt's not in sadhu-vritti?\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tNot in Sadhu Vritti, interestingly enough. You would think it would be there, but it's actually in the section of tat-tat-karma-pravartanat. Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur explains what are the favorable activities for devotional service and he lists the first five, which are 1) accepting a bona fide spiritual master, 2) inquiring from him, 3) taking initiation from him, 4) serving him, and then 5) following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas. So he elaborates on that within the context of those activities which are favorable for devotional service.\u00a0 So I will read. I think this is the relevant part here\u2026about receiving instructions from the spiritual master. He says: \"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should follow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana:\n\n\n\tsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh\n\tpanthah santapa-varjitah\n\tanavapta-sramam purve\n\tyena santah pratasthire\n\n\n\tOne should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That path bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\"\n\n\n\tThat's the translation of that verse.\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and satisfaction. When we discuss the path of devotional service exhibited by Sri Rupa, Sri Sanatana, Sri Raghunatha, and Sri Haridasa Thakura, then we feel such happiness that it cannot be described. When the miscreant Mohammedans tortured Haridasa Thakura, he said:\n\n\n\tkhanda khanda hai' deha yaya yadi prana\n\ttabu ami vadane na chadi hari-nama\n\te saba jivere krsna! karaha prasada\n\tmora drohe nahu e sabara aparadha\n\n\n\tEven if my body is cut into pieces and I loose my life, I will never give up chanting the Lord's holy name. O Krsna, please be merciful upon these poor souls, kindly excuse them for their offense of torturing me.\"\n\n\n\tWe're almost the end of this section. I will summarize it shortly. \"Maintaining this type of determination and being compassionate to all living entities while always chanting the holy name of Krsna is the path of devotional service exhibited by the previous mahajanas.\"\n\n\n\tIt gives the path. Three things. Can anyone repeat without me having to repeat? What were the three things?\u00a0 Yes. Determination for devotional service, which was? Compassion towards others. Yes. That's the second. And, yes, the holy name. While always chanting the holy name. This was the path of devotional service exhibited by the previous mahajanas. So how did Haridas Thakur manifest that? We just quoted. What did he say? Yes. Correct. He said, \"You can cut my body to pieces and I'll never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" What else did he say? Yes. \"Kindly excuse them.\"\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tAll three of them are right there.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tYes. All three of them are right there. So that's the path. Continuing in Sri Bhaktyaloka\u2026\"A path cannot be manufactured. Whatever path is there should be accepted by sadhus. Those who are proud and want fame try vigorously to discover new paths. Those who have good fortune from past lives give up pride and respect the established path. Those who are unfortunate promenade on a new path and thus cheat the world. Regarding such persons the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.46-47) quotes the Brahma-yamala as follows:\n\n\n\tsruti-smrti-puranadi-\n\tpancaratra-vidhim vina\n\taikantiki harer bhaktir\n\tutpatayaiva kalpate\n\tbhaktir aikantikiveyam\n\tavicarat pratiyate\n\tvastu tastu tatha naiva\n\tyad asastriyateksyate\n\n\n\tDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, Puranas, and Narada Pancaratra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society. Such activities are born out of speculation and therefore they only superficially resemble unalloyed devotion because they are disrespectful to the Vedic injunctions. Disrespecting Vedic injunctions falls in the category of atheism. Whenever there is disrespect for the scriptures, which are the Lord's instructions, that cannot be devotional service.\"\n\n\n\tThis is one section. There is more and it comes a little bit later. But here Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur is explaining a very important point, that these three principles are the path which has been established by the previous mahajanas\u2026 compassion, determination, and constantly chanting the holy name of the Lord. In other words, this is the path given by our previous acaryas. It's the path that all of our previous acaryas followed themselves\u2026constant determination, chanting of the holy name of the Lord, and compassion. And those who deviate from that path, as described here, do so because of pride.\n\n\n\tIt reminds me of a conversation I oftentimes refer to, which was described by Giriraja Maharaja in Satsvarupa Maharaja's \"Prabhupada Lila.\" He told a story about one Indian man, who spoke out when Prabhupada was having a room conversation. I can't remember where it was. But I'm thinking that it must have been in Bombay. One man was challenging Prabhupada, saying that Prabhupada was being too critical. He said something like, \"Swamiji, why are you speaking so harshly. This is not sama darsinah.\" He was quoting the verse from the Bhagavad-gita, how a humble sage by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision, \"panditah sama darsinah.\" He said, \"You are using such strong language.\" I guess Prabhupada was using, as he oftentimes uses, the word \"rascal\", and the man was challenging Prabhupada, \"Why are you speaking so strongly. You should be equal to everyone.\" And Prabhupada was explaining that, \"Actually, these are not my words, they are Krsna's words. Krsna says, \"na mam duskritino mudha.\" He said, \"I am simply repeating Krsna's words.\" He also said, \"panditah sama darsinah is a very high position. I am not on that position. I have to discriminate. I have to see who is following what Krsna says and who is not following what Krsna says. That is my panditah sama darsinah. I don't discriminate. I give those instructions to everybody. And therefore, those who don't follow Krsna's instructions, Krsna says, 'you are a mudha.' So that's my equal vision. I give Krsna's instructions to everyone indiscriminately and either you are following what Krsna says or you are not following what Krsna says.\"\n\n\n\tThe man then further challenged Prabhupada. He said, \"But Swamiji, but what are you doing? All you are doing is just quoting somebody else. Why don't you speak for yourself? And then Prabhupada got very strong with him and he said, \"No. This is our system. We stand solidly on the strength of the words spoken by Krsna in our disciplic succesion. This is my duty. This is my qualification. I do not deviate. We stand on this position firmly. That is our qualification. To repeat what Krsna says.\"\n\n\n\tI think Giriraja Maharaja was also quoted in the story he told, at least the way it was quoted in the \"Prabhupada Lila,\" that after the gathering, while everyone was walking out of the room, the man was heard saying to himself, \"Very interesting. The Swamiji is \"sama darsinah.\"You could say how Prabhupada was not discriminating. He was giving everyone what Krsna said without discrimination. And when Krsna says, \"You are a rascal, then you are a rascal. \"Krsna gives the criteria, therefore I do not discriminate.\"\n\n\n\tavajananti mam mudha\n\tmanusim tanum asritam\n\tparam bhavam ajananto\n\tmama bhuta-mahesvaram (BG 9.11)\n\n\n\tSo therefore our position is to always defend the parampara. In fact there is that well-known story when Vallabha Bhatta came to Lord Caitanya and asked him to hear his commentary on Srimad Bhagavatam. And as we know, nobody else would hear it. He was very frustrated. Nobody would listen to it. Of course, Lord Caitanya didn't give him any credibility. He explained the reason was because he did not accept the words of Sridhar Swami. Vallabha Bhatta thought his commentaries surpassed those of Sridhar Swami. Therefore Lord Caitanya said that, \"One who does not accept the swami [husband] as an authority, is a prostitute.\" And therefore he criticized Vallabha Bhatta for thinking he could surpass Sridhar Swami's commentaries, by presenting something better.\n\n\n\tSo of course, it is always the duty of the spiritual master to present the commentaries of the disciplic succession. If there appears to be discrepancies, he tries to show that there are no discrepancies at all. If he cannot show that there are no discrepancies, then he lets the statements of the acaryas stand by themselves. He doesn't try to impose an interpretation which is does not properly represent the conclusions of the previous acaryas. Therefore here it is stated that those who are proud, neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. And as a result they proceed on their inauspicious path and they ruin themselves.\n\n\n\tSo we already explained what the path was. So now I am going to just read one other section. Here it is. We will read this section and then we will ask Maharaja to speak a little. Maharaja would you like to speak on this topic?\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tYou are doing quite well.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tI don't want to eclipse the presence of somebody who can also very nicely explain such an important topic. Why don't you speak about on what we have talked about so far before I go on to the next related topic? Would you like to say something.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tNothing comes to mind except determination, compassion and chanting the holy name.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tAnd we should not introduce anything that contradicts that path which has been established by our previous acaryas.\n\n\n\tSrila Bhaktivinode Thakur continues: \"Inquiring about sad-dharma, eternal religious principles, is one of the disciple's devotional duties. Therefore Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.47) quotes the following statement from the Sri Naradiya Purana:\n\n\n\tacirad eva sarvarthah\n\tsidhyaty esam abhipsitah\n\tsad-dharmasyavabodhaya\n\tyesam nirbandhini matih\n\n\n\tThose who are eager to awaken their spiritual consciousness and who thus have unflinching, undeviated intelligence certainly attain the desired goal of life very soon.\"\n\n\n\tSo he is giving the qualification of one who has taken initiation. His qualification is that he wants to receive instructions from the spiritual master so that he can follow the spiritual master and the parampara. And what should be the basis of his inquiry? His inquiry should be based on his eagerness to awaken his spiritual consciousness and have unflinching and undeviated intelligence. And here, a very nice point also.\n\n\n\t\"As fortunate persons wish to follow the characteristics of the sadhus' devotional service, they similarly desire to know their duty.\"\n\n\n\tThis reminds of that verse, I think I spoke about the last time I was here. It is a verse from the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam where the demigods are praying to Krsna, describing Him as one Who reciprocates with the acaryas, by accepting the method by which they crossed the material ocean. And because He accepted their method, He demonstrates His kindness to both the acarya and to those who are still left behind, following the same method that the acarya crossed.\n\n\n\tIn fact the example the demigods gave in that prayer is that the acaryas cross the ocean and then leave behind the boat for others to cross. In other words, the same method by which they crossed, Krsna accepts from the acarya's followers. In his commentary Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur says that they leave behind a bhakti movement, or an institution. Prabhupada said that their method included chanting, following in the footsteps of Rupa Goswami and giving the books of the previous acaryas. He said that's what he was doing. So that's the method. And he said that our followers should therefore accept that method to cross because Krsna accepted that method and anyone who follows that acarya, will also be able to cross by following the same method.\n\n\n\tSo here. \"As fortunate persons wish to follow the characteristics of the sadhus' devotional service, they similarly desire to know their duty. Unfortunate proud persons act just the opposite. As they search paths different from those of the sadhus, they disrespect the sadhus' determined conclusions while respecting their own. They do not care to preach the teachings of Mahaprabhu to the people of this world, rather they preach doctrines contradictory to those of Mahaprabhu. They do not know how much misfortune they are creating by this. Those who are simple endeavor to properly learn the teachings of the Lord from Sri Caitanya-caritamrta. The Lord's teachings are our only life. Sad-dharma lies in this alone. The bona fide disciple especially tries to understand sad-dharma. If he cannot understand on his own, then he prays at the feet of his siksa-guru ad learns from him. Those who have this kind of determination to know sad-dharma quickly achieve their desired goal. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.9) says:\n\n\n\tanyabhilasita-sunyam\n\tjnana-karmady-anavrtam\n\tanukulyena krsnanu-\n\tsilanam bhaktir uttama\n\n\n\tOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\"\n\n\n\tSo sad-dharma means that the disciple should be very interested to know about pure devotional service. In fact, it's interesting. I am going to share a little realization I got\u2026an experience I had just recently in Mayapura.\n\n\n\tI gave a Bhagavatam class one day, based on a quote from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta about chanting. He was explaining what is meaningful chanting and what is useless chanting. Since I have the quote right here, I'll read it. It's a very good example from Amrita Vani, by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta.\n\n\n\t\"Pure devotees do not chant the Lord\u2019s names to counteract sinful reactions, accumulate piety, attain heavenly pleasures, to mitigate famine, devastating epidemics, social unrest, disease, civil strife, or to obtain wealth or an earthly kingdom. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to ask Him to fulfill our wishes is to treat Him as our servant. This is an offense. Therefore calling the Lord\u2019s names for any reason other than to attain His devotional service is useless. Jesus Christ told us not to take the Lord\u2019s name in vain.\n\n\n\t\"So I gave a class on this particular topic, quoting different references, explaining that the real purpose for chanting was for pure devotional service. I used different scriptural references from Bhagavatam and Caitanya Caritamrita. After class, one devotee came up and said, \"Maharaja, this is good. But what about me?\" (devotees laugh). It's very common. When devotees hear things like this quote they think, \"Yes. Hearing things about this is good. That's the platform that pure devotees are on. But what has this got to do with me?\" He then asked, \"What am I supposed to do in a situation like this. I'm not a pure devotee.\"\n\n\n\tOne important point to understand, which I tried to get across to him, is that none of us should think that we are pure devotees. But our only interest should be to inquire about pure devotional service. By inquiring about pure devotional service, I get opportunites hear the characteristics of pure devotional service. Therefore a devotee's responsibility is to inquire, to hear about, and to want to know the characteristics of pure devotional service. None of use should think that we are on the platform of pure devotional service. But Krsna becomes pleased when the devotees are eager to hear about, to learn about, and to inquire about the characteristics of pure devotional service, in other words, that, which is being quoted here. \"With firm intelligence inquiring about sad-dharma.\" When a devotee become determined to hear, that's how he gets purified. That's our method. That's our means of purification\u2026hearing about the pure devotional service of the Lord's devotees and the Lord's reciprocation with pure devotional service. Should we hear about mixed devotional service so that we can feel good about ourselves? \"Oh I feel better now that I know that I can engage in mixed devotional service. Krsna will still accept me.\n\n\n\tOf course, Bhagavatam says:\n\n\n\takamah sarva-kamo va\n\tmoksa-kama udara-dhih\n\ttivrena bhakti-yogena\n\tyajeta purusam param\n\n\n\tWhether one is full of all material desire, without any material desire, or desiring liberation\u2026tivrena bhakti yogena. He worships the Lord with determination. This is the method for becoming purified from our tendencies to want to take the comfortable path, rather than the path which is set by the previous mahajanas.\n\n\n\tBut without \"tivrena bhakti yogena\" not only do we become inclined to take the easy path, but those who are proud want credit, recognition and fame. Because they still have that within their hearts, they therefore think, \"Let me present a new path so that I can get followers from those who have doubts about following the previous acaryas. They'll think, \"Oh that sounds good. It's something new.\"\n\n\n\tBut an actual acarya, although he may apparently present something different, because he is an actual acarya, he doesn't deviate from constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord, compassion for others and determination. In what?\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tIn tat-tat-karma-pravartanat\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tIn determination in the execution of devotional service by constant endeavor. This was exemplified by Haridas Thakur. So even though we're not pure devotees, we still follow the path set by the previous mahajanas, and even though we have material desires, we still inquire, \"How can I advance on the path of pure devotional service?\" Not, \"How can I feel comfortable not having achieved pure devotional service.\" That's the point that Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur is going to make here.\n\n\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service.\" I'll read that again.\n\n\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service.\" What is this pure devotional symptom? The pure devotional symptom is that he wants to know what is sad-dharma. That is a pure devotional symptom. He tries to understand sad-dharma. Bhaktivinode Thakur continues, \"If he cannot understand on his own, then he prays at the feet of his siksa-guru and learns from him. Those who have this kind of determination to know sad-dharma, quickly achieve their desired goal.\"\n\n\n\t\"As long as this pure devotional symptom, in the form of understanding sad-dharma, has not clearly manifest in the heart of an inquisitive person, his heart remains covered with darkness and he cannot know what is pure devotional service. If one depends on his own speculation, then unalloyed devotional service will not manifest in his heart.\"\n\n\n\tIn other words, if one speculates, because he still has attachments and desires, he is going to come up with something not in line with our previous acaryas.\n\n\n\tBhaktivinode Thakur then says, \"then unalloyed devotional service will not manifest in his heart. We meet many so-called panditas who think they have understood the constitution of bhakti by their knowledge and intelligence. Some of them have concluded that devotional service mixed with jnana is pure bhakti, and some of them have concluded that devotional service mixed with karma is pure bhakti. They are so proud that if they hear the teachings of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, they say, 'Everyone can make their own conclusion. What is the need for taking the conclusion of Caitanya-caritamrta?' These people never come in touch with sad-dharma because they have no desire to know it. The result of performing their own concocted new process of devotional service is they can never relish pure devotion.\" [end of quote from Bhaktyaloka]\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tAnd not inquiring about pure devotional service.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tbhukti-mukti-sprha yavat\n\tpisaci hrdi vartate\n\n\n\tAs long as these desires for bhukti, for sense enjoyment, and mukti, for liberation, are within the heart, they are like two witches that haunt one like ghosts. As long as these two witches are there haunting one, one will never be able to taste the bliss of pure devotional service. And then they will say, \"What is this pure devotional service? It doesn't bring pleasure. I'm still getting pleasure anyway from this other thing\" (in other words, from a concoction). Then what does Bhaktivinode Thakur say next?\n\n\n\tThe very next point he makes, \"It is the duty of a sadhaka to give up personal enjoyment for the sake of Krsna. Sense gratification is called enjoyment. Dovetailing one's lust for sense gratification in the service of Krsna is renunciation of enjoyment. When one converts his world of enjoyment into what is favorable for devotional service, thus giving up the spirit of enjoying those objects and accepting everything as krsna-prasada, then this is called renunciation of enjoyment.\"[end of quote from Sri Bhaktyaloka]\n\n\n\tAny questions or comments on anything that I've discussed so far? No? Is this the topic you asked me to speak on? Or is this\u2026\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tI want to explain why I chose this topic.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tOh. In other words, I completely missed the whole point of your request?\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tWhat happens is that everbody wants to know, in other words, there is only one way to (inaudible). In other words, we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of Srila Prabhupada's going to the West. So that's why this new topic has been brought up. So I don't know, I mean, how does\u2026(inaudible)\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tSo we should not deviate from what Srila Prabhupada has given us. Is that what you are saying? But this is the whole basis for not deviating from what Srila Prabhupada has given us. This is exactly it. It's the whole basis. Prabhupada has given us a mission.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tYes. He's teaching pure devotional service, but if we don't inquire about pure devotional service, then in one sense, we deviate.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tI think he's looking for the externals. He wants to know what is a deviation from Prabhupada's mission? Is that what you're saying?\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tI thought that whatever way we perform our devotional service, any sort of expertise brings pride. So scholarship in scriptures, like Prabhupada, and the Goswamis and all of our (?), we become sort of proud. It seems that there is one person in our project...\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tWhat is that?\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tYou don't have to say who it is.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tSomebody quoted something?\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tNo. Some scholar in ISKCON thinks there is some sort of going against what the acaryas have established. What my next thought is that if certain people do not follow then certain things, or do we just keep it like that? And instead of giving our own personal ....(inaudible)\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tAnyway, you don't think this covered that topic?\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tI have just given this explanation why we have given this topic to speak on. That's all.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tYes. I understand what he's referring to. Do you know what he's talking about?\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tI don't need to know. The topic I spoke about speaks for itself. I don't need to know why I was asked to speak about this topic.\n\n\n\tIf we are going to present ourselves as an acarya then we should make sure that we stand on these three firm principles of our disciplic succession. That is\u2026 constantly chanting the holy name of the Lord, being compassionate to others, and being strictly determined to follow the path of the previous acaryas. And if those three items are there, then fine. But if they're not, then Bhaktivinode Thakur says that if one, unfortunately, is proud, having introduced a new path, he promenades on that new path, cheats himself, and unfortunately, he cheats everyone else who follows him. So this is the criteria.\n\n\n\tSomeone may look for an excuse. \"Oh this can be very subjective.\" No. Everything can be subjective. But still we must know what is the criteria. How do we know that somebody is following these three things.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tWe might say that one is representing the previous acaryas, but if we jump over the present acaryas and give our own understanding of what the previous acaryas say and apply it in the present situation without following in the footsteps of the present acaryas\u2026in other words, one has to has to follow the present acarya in order to follow the previous acaryas. You can't jump over. Does that make sense?\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tYes.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tAnd that's what you're indicating, right? If someone is going to the previous acaryas and are getting ideas that are contrary to the present acaryas. Is that a sense of pride, creating your own path based upon your own speculation of what the previous acaryas had said. That's what he's talking about, basically.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tDo we need to discuss details? I don't think so.Yes? You have a question?\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tNot being a pure devotee, is that the natural consequence of a deviation.\u2028\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tNot being a pure devotee?\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tYes. So if you're not a pure devotee then naturally you have deviated. Isn't it?\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tSomewhere along the line, there was a deviation.\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tAnd there would be a natural consequence of the deviation.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tYes. And therefore the natural solution is to get back on the right path.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tIf you're following pure devotional service, then you might say that is also a pure devotee. If you're following the principles and inquiring about pure devotional service, that is pure devotional service.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tYes. I was hearing a lecture recently, Prabhupada was saying, I'm paraphrasing, but he was saying that even though we may not be able to completely follow, just having the desire to follow, Krsna accepts that as devotional service. The desire in itself. He accepts that as devotional service Krsna is \"bhava grahi janardana.\" He accepts the essence of a person's attitude. Even though he externally may not fully be able to perform things perfectly, but if he's sincere and he has a desire to perform, then Krsna accepts the essence of a devotee's attitude and then helps that devotee to make progress.\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tI have a question. So what is the attitude of that person who inquired, \"that is not for me.\" So what is the understanding that he has?\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tWhat was the understanding he has? Well actually I have to be honest. When I explained everything to him, he accepted it. He said, \"Thank you, you just cleared up all of my doubts.\"\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tHe's one of many. But why do people think like that? What is the rationale that justifies that type of mentality?\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tBecause their faith is weak. There are many reasons. It could be that they don't see an example. That could be another reason. They don't see any example of somebody to follow. But then they have to look within their own hearts to see why they don't see an example. It could be something in their own heart also that prevents them from seeing an example even though examples may still be there.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tOr they maybe cultivated a mood of sense gratification...\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tYes. As we just read. There is still some desire for karma and jnana, and therefore because there is still some desire for karma and jnana, one thinks, \"Yes. These things are pure bhakti.\" Even though it's mixed with karma, he thinks it's pure bhakti. And when he hears what pure bhakti is from Caitanya Caritamrita, he thinks, \"Why do I have to hear that?\"\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tBut by hearing that, one becomes humble.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tBut by hearing it, by being willing to hear it, his heart becomes humble and he becomes purified. If he hears submissively. Submissive inquiry and service. And then his heart becomes purified. Krsna accepts him. In the Bhagavatam, the sages are saying to Suta Goswami, that because you are submissive, your gurus gave you all the favors necessary so that you can tell us exactly what is the science of devotional service. You can scientifically tell us because you were submissive to your guru. Isn't that the essence of the verse?\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tAnd also because you are gentle by nature.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tGentle. Yes. Gentle by nature.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tBecause you are gentle by nature, you can receive it.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tYes. Very good point. Instead of challenging due to pride. Yes. Another question?\n\n\n\tDevotee\n\tWhen these disciples are creating new paths. Is there like a different meaning? Because devotees do have their own styles, they feel like, same mood, but they are ....(inaudible)\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tThat's not a new path. If one follows the principles of determination in devotional service, giving up sense gratification, as Bhaktivinode Thakur goes on to explain next, genuine compassion. Genuine compassion means giving\u2026we used Prabhupada as an example. What was his compassion? What was his \"panditah sama darsinah?\" His compassion was giving the conclusions of the previous acaryas. That was his compassion. So because he gave the conclusions of the previous acaryas, he didn't deviate from siddhanta. So that's not a new path, by presenting things in a different way to attract people to pure bhakti. But a new path is when it deviates from these three principles. That's a new path. And therefore we have to see if such a path is deviating from these three principles.\n\n\n\tNot only that\u2026it's one thing to introduce a new way for people to come to Krsna consciousness. But what are we going to bring them to when they come? We have to bring them to the path of the previous mahajanas\u2026not to a new path and think that this is the accepted norm\u2026 some new way. It means that we have to teach by our example what is the path of the mahajanas. If we don't teach by own example, what the path is of the mahajanas, we may create a method for bringing others to Krsna consciousness but we may bring them to.... it's a like an example I oftentimes give. People call it \"bridge preaching.\" They build the bridge and then they get occupied with the bridge\u2026they spend all their money and everything on the bridge and just think, \"Why don't we just stay on the bridge? What's the sense of going to other side? Why don't I just live on the bridge and bring everyone with me on the bridge? But the purpose of the bridge is to bring everyone to the other side. But if you don't show the other side, then what's the value of bridge preaching if there's no other side to go to? The other side is pure bhakti. So it means that I have to be engaged in pure bhakti. If I bring everybody to me and say, \"OK this is my bridge.\" But if I'm not engaged in pure bhakti then I'm preventing everybody from getting to the other side of the bridge. Then I'm not really bringing anyone anywhere. So I have to be following pure bhakti. Or at least, I have to bring people to those who are following pure bhakti, so that they can take them to the other side of the bridge. But the difficulty is that people get so obsessed with their new path, with their new mode of presentation, that they think, \"This is it! This is the new way. Let's all of us stay here and be satisfied with this and forget about what's on the other side.\"\n\n\n\tSo, that example has to be there also. That if we are going to introduce something new, that's different, we better make sure that we are bringing people to pure bhakti. And if we are not interested to bring anybody to the other side, we better be sure that we're on the platform of pure bhakti ourselves. Otherwise, everybody we gather together, are not going anywhere. They are not making it to the other side. They are being cheated. Unfortunately.\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tOr, if one is not creating a new path and one is following the present acaryas, but at the same time not bringing people ultimately to the goal. They are presenting in a very (inaudible) or dogmatic way, where is he going?\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tThat the path in itself is the goal?\n\n\n\tCandramauli Swami\n\tKrsna says something also to Lord Brahma at the end of Brahma Samhita, very similar to these three points, where He sums up the whole process in three statements. Three points which He also says, and glorifies Brahma and says, \"Oh Vidhi, one who is knowledge\", and He describes that the ultimate success is three principles, perserverance in practice, following scriptural evidence and what is that? I can't remember the actual word but the point is that proper Vaisnava culture, etiquette, behavior, in other words, the acara, or the practice, the proper mood of a Vaisnava. We might compare that to compassion and chanting of the holy name would be following the scripture, and determination would be perserverance of practice. It's very similar to what Krsna says to Lord Brahma. That is at the end of the fifth chapter of Brahma Samhita. It's one of the verses of the Brahma Samhita. It's at the very end of that fifth chapter. He glorifies Lord Brahma and then he sums up the whole process. Krsna's responding to Brahma's prayers. And he says, \"perserverance and practice, following scriptural evidence, and I can't remember the actual statement but the proper way to execute. In other words, a Vaisnava's behaviour, culture, which would be compassion.\n\n\n\tNiranjana Swami\n\tUnfortunately we're supposed to end at five. So we should end here. It's after five. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna. Jaya Srila Prabhupada!\n\n","nid":"11602"},{

I am especially happy to be able to be here with His Holiness Bhakti Caitanya Swami. I think all of you should give him a very warm welcome. It is a great privilege for me to be with him. It may appear to be rather bold of me to be speaking before him but we discussed who should speak first and I didn\u2019t tell him this, but I decided that I should probably speak first so that he could correct me after I finish speaking. He is very learned. I am oftentimes amazed at the depth of not only his scholarship but also his wisdom. He is an unlimited ocean full of nectarian pastimes of Krsna in Vrndavan. This is why I wanted to speak first (laughter), because I have the microphone. I am oftentimes in his presence feeling very much dwarfed by his advancement in spiritual life.\n\n\n\t(laughing and speaking in Russian referring to Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja\u2019s microphone): It\u2019s not working!\n\n\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami, speaking in Russian):\u201dIt\u2019s not truth.\u201d\n\n\n\tNot only is he a GBC godbrother, but he is also this year\u2019s chairman of the GBC. In other words all of the ISKCON matters come directly into his email box every day. He has fulfilled that responsibility so well that this is the second time that he\u2019s been asked to do it.\n\n\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami speaking in Russian): \u201cPlease, speak about Krsna.\u201d\n\n\n\t(Niranjana Swami speaking in Russian): \u201cI am speaking. When I speak about Krsna\u2019s devotee, it is like speaking about Krsna.\u201d\n\n\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami speaking in Russian): \u201cYou are talking about a devotee? I am not a devotee\u201d\n\n\n\tI will stop. Because I already got my message across, and therefore you fully understand why I won\u2019t speak very long so that he can have the opportunity to enlighten all of us and for that alone I feel very grateful.\n\n\n\tI was requested today to speak on a particular topic. Often times when I visit the temples I ask the leaders: \u201cWhat would you like me to speak about?\u201d I won\u2019t tell you what I was asked to speak about but I have chosen the verse that\u2019s connected to the topic. I selected it just a few minutes before coming here and I mentioned it to Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja on the way because he said that he will speak about whatever topic I will speak about.\n\n\n\tI am reading a verse from the Srimad Bhagavatam 4.8.34. I will read first the Sanskrit and then the translation and commentary\n\n\n\tgunadhikan mudam lipsed\n\tanukrosam gunadhamat\n\tmaitrim samanad anvicchen\n\tna tapair abhibhuyate\n\n\n\t\u201cEvery man should act like this: when he meets a person more qualified than himself he should be very pleased. When he meets someone less qualified than himself, he should be compassionate towards him, and when he meets someone equal to himself, he should make friendship with him. In this way one is never affected by the three-fold miseries of this world.\u201d\n\n\n\tPurport by Srila Prabhupada\n\n\n\tGenerally when we find someone more qualified than ourselves, we become envious of him; when we find someone less qualified, we deride him; and when we find someone equal we become very proud of our activities. These are the causes of all material tribulations. The great sage Narada therefore advised that a devotee should act perfectly. Instead of being envious of a more qualified man, one should be jolly to receive him. Instead of being oppressive to a less qualified man, one should be compassionate toward him just to raise him to the proper standard. And when one meets an equal, instead of being proud of one's own activities before him, one should treat him as a friend. One should also have compassion for the people in general, who are suffering due to forgetfulness of Krsna. These important functions will make one happy within this material world.\n\n\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\n\n\n\tThis is a very nice verse spoken by Sri Narada Muni to Dhruva Maharaja. He is beginning his instructions to Dhruva in order to prepare him for his purification. Whenever there are instructions given by a saintly person, it is understood that they are meant for the purification of the recipient. Narada Muni is giving an important instruction here, which clearly stated, is meant to help one become unaffected by the miseries of this material world. Most people do not fully understand why they experience misery.\n\n\n\tIn fact one of our great acharyas, Srila Sanatana Goswami, taught by his example. When he came in the presence of his superior, the first question he asked was, \u201cWho am I and why do I have to suffer the three-fold miseries?\u201d In other words he was teaching by his example that an intelligent person should try to understand why he is suffering from miseries. He should not look for a temporary solution but should look for something more permanent than treating the symptom.\u00a0\n\n\n\tOftentimes we may ask ourselves, \u201cWhy am I suffering like this?\u201d However, most people will look for a way to relieve the suffering instead of trying to find the root cause of suffering. In their attempt to find more immediate relief they fail to gain the permanent solution. In fact, if we don\u2019t know the root cause of suffering, in our efforts to obtain relief, we may mistake relief for happiness. But the reality is that this relief is the cause of further distress. This is profound if you think about it. Most people will not dig down deep enough to look for the actual cause of suffering. For them, immediate relief is the more suitable solution.\n\n\n\tIn fact, a five year old boy, Prahlada Maharaja, had something to say in this regard. He said, \u201cIn this material world every materialist is endeavouring for happiness and he is trying to mitigate his distress and therefore he is acting accordingly. Actually one cannot be happy as long as he endeavours for happiness; because as soon as he begins his endeavours for happiness, immediately his conditions for distress appear.\u201d\u00a0 For a five year old boy, that's a profound statement. He is saying that in the material world everyone is trying to be happy and to relieve themselves from distress. And they think, \"If I can achieve some immediate happiness, then I am happy.\" But they don't know the price they have to pay for that temporary relief, and that is: as long as I am only thinking about \"my\" happiness I am creating future distress for myself.\n\n\n\tThat is the nature of the materialistic person: he's motivated by his own happiness even though he may also be motivated to make others happy. It might seem like that\u2019s selfless. But if he is motivated to make others happy as long as it makes him happy, that is not selfless. Sometimes he may try to make others happy by implicating them in sinful activities which will only be the cause of his own distress. He thinks, \u201cI am making him happy.\" But he becomes implicated himself and thus creates his own future distress.\n\n\n\tTherefore an intelligent person should understand what is the root cause of suffering in this world and should seek a solution which will be beneficial for everyone and not just himself. When I think only of my own happiness it might not be necessarily beneficial for others. Unfortunately, the nature of this world is that people will do anything for their own happiness at the expense of others. They may say: \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to cause you suffering.\" There is an expression in English \u201cThat\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles.\u201d It\u2019s a very popular statement in America. In other words, what it really means is, \"You'll just have to accept that\u2019s the way it happened, what can I do?\n\n\n\tNarada Muni is here giving instructions to Dhruva Maharaja. Of course this is not the complete set of instructions on how to become free from misery. We can think of many instructions on how to become free from misery. But if we analyze his instruction here, he is telling Dhruva Maharaja how to become free from envy, because envy is a fundamental cause of our suffering in this world. Until one\u2019s heart becomes free from envy then, according to a statement of Prahlada Maharaja in another verse in the Fifth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, one will never be able to think of the welfare of others.\n\n\n\tAs much as one may try to help others or to make others happy, until this envy is completely uprooted from one\u2019s heart, there will always be some tinge of selfish motivation. Therefore this instruction is a very good instruction on how to become unaffected by material miseries and how to become genuinely happy in this world and happiness is definitely something that everybody is aspiring for.\n\n\n\tThe Srimad Bhagavatam states:\n\n\n\ttasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido\n\tna labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah\n\ttal labhyate duhkhavad anyatah sukham\n\tkalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa\n\n\n\t\"Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the lowest planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.\" (SB 1.5.18)\n\n\n\tAn intelligent person knows that happiness will come, just as miseries come without asking for them. As we have oftentimes explain\u2026nobody makes plans to suffer, nobody asks \u201cHow can I be miserable today?\u201d Did anyone wake up in this morning and make plans how to suffer today? An intelligent person doesn\u2019t do that. An intelligent person will think, \"What can I do that\u2019s productive today?\"\n\n\n\tStill, as Bhagavatam states miseries come without planning for them. I don\u2019t have to make plans for them. They come. An intelligent person also knows that happiness will come in the same way. Therefore an intelligent person endeavors neither for happiness nor distress, specifically speaking about material happiness. However, as far as spiritual happiness is concerned, which is the happiness which satisfies the self, spiritual happiness comes by making efforts to satisfy the Lord and His devotees.\u00a0\n\n\n\tBhajaniya-parama-purusha-sukha-matra-sva-sukhatvam\n\n\n\tIn his sandarbhas, Srila Jiva Goswami states that to the degree that we can satisfy the Supreme, to that degree we can also become happy. The benefit of such happiness is that it\u2019s so satisfying to the self that it makes material happiness insignificant, so insignificant that the person who experiences it no longer feels the need to endeavor for it.\n\n\n\tNow, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if every one of us had somebody who was always thinking about our happiness, making arrangements for us without us even having to think about how to be happy? Imagine if you had a real good friend who would always watch every single move that you make, always anticipating what he could do so that you could be happy. If they saw any potential obstacle or difficulty that you would confront, they would immediately arrange to mitigate it for you. Wouldn\u2019t you like to have a friend like that? The fact of the matter is: you do. And everybody does. The difficulty is that we have forgotten our connection with Him.\n\n\n\tIn so many places Krsna says in the Bhagavad-gita 9.22, if you make endeavors to Me, I will help you. If you always remember Me, I will carry what you lack and I will preserve what you have. If you endeavor to serve Me, I will illuminate transcendental knowledge within your heart, by which you will be able to realize your full potential, your spiritual identity, and become completely free from all identification with suffering within this world.\n\n\n\tThe fact is that everyone of us has a friend within each and every one of our hearts, who wants nothing more than to make arrangements for our happiness. He is ready, He is waiting for us to turn to Him, to recognize Him, and to follow His dictation on how we can come closer to Him.\n\n\n\tTherefore if we want to find the solution to suffering in this world, if we are intelligent, we will try to understand how to establish our connection with our best friend. Our best friend is trying to tell us, through His representatives, manifesting Himself in so many ways by which we can approach Him. And all He is asking is that we serve Him, cultivate and develop our love for Him, remember Him, follow His instructions, serve those who are dear to Him, and glorify Him. In so many ways He\u2019s giving us the means to establish our connection with Him.\n\n\n\tTherefore an intelligent person should try to make that connection strong. The more we can strengthen our connection with Him, our best friend, the more our best friend says that He will relieve us from the miseries of material life. He says to Arjuna, \u201cIf you abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me, I will take all those reactions away that you\u2019ve accumulated for millions of births.\u201d Therefore an intelligent person endeavors to serve the Supreme. By making endeavors to serve the Supreme he automatically transcends the happiness and distress of this world. Now, of course we said automatically\u00a0\u00a0 it\u2019s not just like that (snapping fingers). It can be like that (snapping fingers). Generally it isn\u2019t. Generally purification of heart has to take place. Srila Rupa Goswami describes,\n\n\n\tiha yasya harer dasye\n\tkarmana manasa gira\n\tnikhilasv apy avasthasu\n\tjivan-muktah sa ucyate\n\n\n\t\u201cAnyone who fully engages his mind, his body, his words in the service to Krsna, he is already a liberated soul even while within this material body. \u201c\n\n\n\tA devotee of the Lord does not have to wait until he gives up this body for liberation. He can experience liberation, freedom from suffering, even while within the body. Why? Because Krsna is there, removing all obstacles on his path and satisfying the devotee within his heart, making the devotee so satisfied that he is not even conscious of the sufferings of this world.\n\n\n\tIn the Srimad Bhagavatam 3.25.23 it is stated,\n\n\n\tmad-asrayah katha mrstah\n\tsrnvanti kathayanti ca\n\n\n\t\u201cEngaged constantly in hearing and chanting about Me, those sadhus are not affected by material miseries in this world, because they are always filled with thought of Me\u201d \u2013 Lord Kapiladeva says. Of course in the next verse He says\n\n\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi\n\tsarva-sa\u0144ga-vivarjitah\u00a0\n\n\n\tHe says to His mother, Devahuti ,\n\n\n\t\u201cO My mother, o virtuous lady, you should seek out the association of saintly persons, become attached to them by hearing from them. When you will become attached it will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachments.\u201d (SB 3.25.24)\n\n\n\tSo the point is that a devotee must learn how to conduct himself in this world, so that his heart can become purified and free from envy, by knowing how to properly deal with everyone in this world on the spiritual platform. Not on the platform of competition, not on the platform of being envious of the superior or by deriding persons who are not as well off or advanced as ourselves, but by seeing how to properly engage in meaningful relationships with everyone on the spiritual platform, a person can become happy in this world.\n\n\n\tAnd now we will hear from Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja who will tell us how to do that.\n\n\n\tH. H.Bhakti Caitanya Swami :\n\n\n\tI feel very honored, privileged and embarrassed to be sitting here with Maharaja. Prabhupada talks about the mosquito sitting on the lap of the king, and people are coming and bowing down before the king and the mosquito thinks, \u201cHa! See, they are bowing down before me!\u201d So that\u2019s my position here.\n\n\n\t(speaking in Russian): That\u2019s truth.\n\n\n\t(Niranjana Swami, speaking in Russian): Not truth.\n\n\n\t(Bhakti Caitanya Swami, speaking in Russian): It\u2019s truth, 108 percent.\n\n\n\tThe real reason, from my perspective, why I wanted to speak after Maharaja is because I have nothing to say, but I can pick something up if I listen to Maharaja. He is just so inspired that I can pick some inspiration from him. It\u2019s truth and it\u2019s really, really nice, the association of devotees particularly, special devotees, it\u2019s really very nice.\n\n\n\tNear Varsana there is a village with still a quite pleasant kunda, that is called Kisori Kund. One day Srimati Radharani was sitting with her gopi friends and preparing to meet with Krsna, Who was due to come any time. They were in some anxiety, \"He might just walk around the corner right now and we are not quite ready.\" So Srimati Radharani was almost ready except she hadn\u2019t put her anjana on her eyes. You know what I mean, anjana, they call it kajal, it\u2019s the black substance ladies put right on the eye lids.\n\n\n\t(speaking in Russian): Do you understand? Good!\n\n\n\tSo she had put some anjana on one eye and Krsna appeared on the scene and He saw Radharani and of course He is stunned. But then He came right up to Radharani and looking at her and He saw how beautiful and just saturated with devotion she was but she didn\u2019t have anjana on. So Krsna called out, \u201cYou are nir-anjana!\u201d Yes. And then Krsna put anjana on Radharani\u2019s eyes. So this place is there. It\u2019s called Anjanoka, and this is called nir-anjana lila. It\u2019s there in the sastra. So niranjana \u2013 this is special.\n\n\n\tMaharaja was saying so nicely about associating with different types of devotees and different types of people. You know, Srila Prabhupada said that we will have another ISKCON in the spiritual world and we will all be together in the spiritual world. One devotee was telling me, I won\u2019t mention his name, he said that when he heard that, his spontaneous reaction was, he thought of some devotees he had problems with, and he thought, \u201cWe're going to be together forever!? Oh no!\u201d\n\n\n\tThe thing is we have to become such a person, such a devotee, so we can fit in with the other devotees and be at home with the other devotees. It\u2019s one thing to work with someone, oh, you just have to work together, you just may do it. Or, you just meet someone sometimes and you just briefly have to interact in a certain way, but when you share the same home as a person, well you better get on with the people you share the home with. And in Vrndavan, Krsna is at home, Krsna is God at home and Narayana or Vishnu is more like God at work. Vishnu is dealing with all the conditioned souls, He is in the heart of even the greatest demons and most fallen creatures and He does that because it\u2019s like His work you could say. But in Vrndavan, Krsna is God at home. So to go home you have to be that sort of person who Krsna is willing to be at home with. The home is where the heart is. Krsna only lets people into His home if they have really captured His heart. We have to be able to get on with the devotees. At least get on, but actually we should really develop some real affection for the devotees.\n\n\n\tOne time Narada Muni attended the meeting of all the major holy places. They were having this big debate: which is the king of all of us, the topmost of all the holy places? They were debating and discussing and one holy place was saying, \u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d Another was saying, \u201cNo, no, no! It\u2019s me!\u201d In the end they had a vote and Prayag was elected the tirtharaja, or the king of all the holy places. Narada Muni was there and he was witnessing all of this, and at the end he went up and he congratulated Prayag. \u201cYou are such a nice holy place, I like to visit you so much\u201d And Prayag said, \u201cYes, thank you, I feel good about it, but I have one problem: all the holy places here they all respected me, they all accepted me as the king, but where is Vrndavan? Why isn\u2019t Vrndavan here? Why won\u2019t Vrndavan come and accept me as the king? Prayag said \u201cwell he associates with Krsna a lot, maybe he got puffed up\u201d\n\n\n\tNarada Muni said, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that. I think what you should do is go and ask Krsna.\u201d So Prayag went and he visited Krsna, and he explained that this is the situation: all the holy places respected me but not Vrndavan. Krsna started crying and said, \u201cVrndavan is not like you. Vrndavan is not just a holy place. Vrndavan is My home and home is where the heart is, so My heart is there in Vrndavan.\u201d\n\n\n\tVrndavan Dham is unique amongst all the holy places. Krsna only really let\u2019s people into Vrndavan if He feels confident enough, sure enough, \u201cI can let this person have My heart.\u201d Therefore in the Nectar of Devotion, Srila Rupa Goswami explains that Krsna may give material enjoyment, He can easily give impersonal realization, but pure devotional service, particularly on the level of Vrndavan, oh, Krsna is very careful before He gives that!\n\n\n\tIn the 12th chapter of Bhagavad-gita, verses 13 to 20, Krsna explains the characteristics of a person who is very dear to Him. If a person is very humble and kind to others then he is very dear to Him. Krsna gives so many different qualities, which He says, if you have these qualities, you become very dear to Me. So Srila Prabhupada gave one lecture on verses 13 and 14 from that chapter and Srila Prabhupada is making this point that we have to become like that and then Srila Prabhupada says, \u201cYes, this is Krsna Consciousness. How will Krsna love me? How will I become such a person that Krsna will see me and think: \"There He is! That\u2019s My person, My dear devotee.\u201d\n\n\n\tThis is what the process of devotional service is all about. Such an important part of that is how we associate with the devotees. Krsna, before He lets someone into His heart, into Vrndavan, Krsna tests to see: is this person really serious completely? Do they have some other ideas also? Krsna tests the devotees, He is in one sense, you could say, leading the devotees down the path back to His lotus feet, putting devotees through different experiences which will help them to become that sort of person. Sometimes there are tests and we may not appreciate it. But really it is for our benefit and for our development as devotees.\n\n\n\tThere are many interesting stories in this regard and we can mention one.\n\n\n\tThere was a king and he was a devotee something, something, mixed position. He had a minister, they were very close to each other but the minister was really a devotee. The king, of course is a ksatrya, and a traditional ksatrya must keep strong and able to fight. The ksatryas sometimes would go out and hunt animals and this king, he would also do that. One day they were out in the forest and the king was aiming an arrow at some animal and he was just about to fire the arrow but then he slipped. The arrow jumped out of his hand and it cut off the part of his thumb. The king was shocked: \u201cLook at this! What has happened? This is a disaster!\u201d He showed the minister \u201cLook what happened to my thumb!\u201d And you know what the minster said? \u201cIt\u2019s Krsna\u2019s mercy\u201d The king said, \u201cWhat? What do you mean it\u2019s Krsna\u2019s mercy? I lost the part of my thumb, how is this Krsna\u2019s mercy?\u201d The minister said, \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s Krsna\u2019s mercy.\u201d The king got really disturbed and angry and he told the soldiers, \u201cLock him up. He is offensive, he is crazy.\u201d So they locked up the minister.\n\n\n\tSome days later the king\u2019s thumb, it was still bad but he was able to go out hunting again. So out he went, no minister with him, wandering around in the forest but he got lost. He went wandering and wandering, he got arrested by some aboriginal people. He told them, \u201cYou can\u2019t arrest me, I am the king!\u201d The aboriginal people said, \u201cYou are the king? That\u2019s wonderful! We have been looking for someone like you. We\u2019ve been looking for a good person to make a human sacrifice to Mother Kali. We will sacrifice you. It is an honor.\u201d\n\n\n\tThe king, of course was not very happy. They were preparing him to be sacrificed to Kali and the priest was dressing the king and decorating him, then he noticed: part of his thumb is missing. The priest said, \u201cOh no, his body is not whole, we cannot offer him to Kali.\u201d They apologized to the king and they let the king go. The king thought, \u201cWow! That was Krsna\u2019s mercy!\u201d Then he looked at his thumb and he thought, \u201cYes. What the minister said was right. It was Krsna\u2019s mercy but I couldn\u2019t recognize it. So I locked the minister up. Oh no! What an offense!\u201d And he went running back and released the minister, he was apologizing and apologizing to the minister, \u201cWhat an offense! I am such a fool! It\u2019s terrible. I am so sorry.\u201d And you know what the minister said, \u201cNo, no, no! It was Krsna\u2019s mercy for me.\u201d The king said, \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t Krsna\u2019s mercy, it was my offense.\u201d The minister said, \u201cNo, it was Krsna\u2019s mercy for me. I will explain. If you had not locked me up, I would have been out there in the forest with you hunting. I would have been arrested with you, and of course they would not sacrifice you because your body is not whole, but my body is whole so they would have sacrificed me. So you see, it was Krsna\u2019s mercy for me.\u201d\n\n\n\tKrsna is very amazing actually, how He deals with His devotees. Krsna always deals with the sincere devotees to help them to make progress. Even though sometimes to the neophyte eye it may not seem like what Krsna is arranging is really mercy. We should try to see from this perspective and try to understand this point about association that if we can't fit in with the devotees who are Krsna's dear associates then how can we fit in with Krsna?\n\n\n\tTherefore Srila Jiva Goswami in Bhakti Sandarbha gives a very interesting, little analysis. He actually is translating the verse spoken by Krsna in the Eleventh Canto of the Bhagavatam. The way he translates is, he says that Krsna is speaking that: \u201cServing the devotees and developing love for the devotees is a more effective way of developing love for Me than trying to develop love for Me. This is why Srila Prabhupada has created this ISKCON movement, so everybody could get the association of sincere devotees. Someone may be so called this or that, in certain respects more important and someone less, but any sincere devotee, we should know, they are very dear to Krsna.\n\n\n\tI was sitting once in class in Bhaktivedanta Manor while Srila Prabhupada was giving class, and he was saying, \"You should be very careful how you associate with the devotee, because you may not really be able to recognize who the devotee is. You don't know. Right now you might be sitting next to Narada Muni.\"\n\n\n\tWell, I'm very fortunate, because I'm sitting next to Niranjana Maharaja and he was giving class and it was just so nice. Really, truly reminding me so much of Srila Prabhupada giving class, particularly if you listen to Srila Prabhupada's classes, the classes he was giving in America in 1966, Prabhupada speaking in such a heartfelt way, with great emotion. You can hear it and feel it so vividly, how he is just appealing to the people and desiring that the people can get the message and get the opportunity. So I was listening to Maharaja and I was remembering that and he was just reminding me so much and I was feeling, \u201cI'm really safe here.\u201d\u00a0 Until I have to start speaking. That's really different.\u00a0 \"Fasten the seat belts.\"\n\n\n\tSo, thank you all for coming and participating. Thank you very much to Maharaja for giving me his invaluable association. Thank you to Gaura Nitai for giving Their mercy, and thank you to Srila Prabhupada by whose mercy we have got all of this.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada ki! Jaya!\n\n\n\tHare Krsna\n\n","nid":"11369"},{

Such transcendental devotees are completely situated in an uncontaminated state of life. By the process of devotional service I shall surely be able to cross the nescient ocean of material existence, which is filled with the waves of blazing, firelike dangers. It will be very easy for me, for I am becoming mad to hear about Your transcendental qualities and pastimes, which are eternally existent.\n\n\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\n\n\n\tThe significant point in Dhruva Maharaja's statement is that he wanted the association of pure devotees. Transcendental devotional service cannot be complete and cannot be relishable without the association of devotees. We have therefore established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Anyone who is trying to be aloof from this Krishna Consciousness Society and yet engage in Krsna consciousness is living in a great hallucination, for this is not possible. From this statement by Dhruva Maharaja it is clear that unless one is associated with devotees, his devotional service does not mature; it does not become distinct from material activities. The Lord says, satam prasangan mama virya-samvido bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah (SB 3.25.25). Only in the association of pure devotees can the words of Lord Krsna be fully potent and relishable to the heart and ear. Dhruva Maharaja explicitly wanted the association of devotees. That association in devotional activities is just like the waves of an incessantly flowing river. In our Krishna Consciousness Society we have full engagement twenty-four hours a day. Every moment of our time is always busily engaged in the service of the Lord. This is called the incessant flow of devotional service.\n\n\n\tA Mayavadi philosopher may question us, \"You may be very happy in the association of devotees, but what is your plan for crossing the ocean of material existence?\" Dhruva Maharaja's answer is that it is not very difficult. He clearly says that this ocean can be crossed very easily if one simply becomes mad to hear the glories of the Lord. Bhavad-guna-katha: for anyone who persistently engages in hearing the topics of the Lord from Srimad Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam and Caitanya-caritamrta and who is actually addicted to this process, just as one becomes addicted to intoxicants, it is very easy to cross the nescience of material existence. The ocean of material nescience is compared to a blazing fire, but to a devotee this blazing fire is insignificant because he is completely absorbed in devotional service. Although the material world is blazing fire, to a devotee it appears full of pleasure (visvam purna-sukhayate).\n\n\n\tThe purport of this statement by Dhruva Maharaja is that devotional service in the association of devotees is the cause of the development of further devotional service. By devotional service only is one elevated to the transcendental planet Goloka Vrndavana, and there also there is only devotional service, for the activities of devotional service both in this world and in the spiritual world are one and the same. Devotional service does not change. The example of a mango can be given here. If one gets an unripe mango, it is still a mango, and when it is ripe it remains the same mango, but it has become more tasteful and relishable. Similarly, there is devotional service performed according to the direction of the spiritual master and the injunctions and regulative principles of sastra, and there is devotional service in the spiritual world, rendered directly in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But they are both the same. There is no change. The difference is that one stage is unripe and the other is ripe and more relishable. It is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees.\n\n\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\n\n\n\tSo, yesterday Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja brought us to the point in his introduction to this topic of how Dhruva Maharaja began to speak here in these verses. Now we are hearing in these verses a very important point about the necessity to associate with devotees.\n\n\n\tIt is interesting to note that Dhruva Maharaja here has association with the Lord, but still what is he asking the Lord for? He is asking for the association of devotees. We oftentimes hear such requests from devotees in the presence of the Lord. Upon achieving darshan of the Lord and the opportunity to obtain a benediction from the Lord, the devotee asks for the opportunity to always be in the association of His devotees.\n\n\n\tIn the presence of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Haridasa Thakura requested the Lord for a benediction. Not only did he ask for association of the devotees, but he also begged the Lord to forgive him for asking something further from Him. He said, \u201cPlease Lord, I beg that you simply give me the opportunity to take the remnants of foodstuffs from your devotees.\u201d He said, \u201cI know that I am not deserving of such a benediction, and forgive me for my arrogance for asking something so great from You. But I know nothing else.\u201d He expressed that desire to the Lord.\n\n\n\tIn other words, from these examples\u2026 the request made by Haridasa Thakura, this prayer of Dhruva Maharaja, and the prayers of so many others devotees who have achieved the darshan of the Lord, they demonstrate by their own example, what they consider to be most important to them. Bhaktivinoda Thakura even prays that better than to take birth as Lord Brahma is that he be given an opportunity to take birth as an insect in a house of the devotee. Therefore, we can appreciate from these examples just how great and important it is to obtain the benediction of the association of the Lord\u2019s devotees. But what is that association? What is Dhruva Maharaja asking for in this verse? He says, \u201cI want to be in association of those devotees who are constantly engaged in describing Your transcendental glories. I am begging from You the opportunity to always hear from these devotees.\u201d\n\n\n\tIn the Srimad Bhagavatam, Fourth Canto, Narada Muni, in his instructions to King Pracinabarhisat, explains what takes place when one has the opportunity to be in the association of devotees who are possessed of this quality. He says, \u201cIn a place, where pure devotees meet, following the rules and regulations, and who are purely conscious, because they are always hankering and eager to discuss and hear about the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which are like a continuous flow of nectar from their mouths\u2026 In that place, if one gets a chance to hear the flow of nectar, one will forget about all necessities of life such as hunger and thirst, and one will become free from all kinds of illusion, lamentation and fear.\" Narada Muni is explaining what takes place when devotees come together.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada also speaks about that here in the commentary. He alludes to it in some places, and in some places he is very specific. He is saying that our Krishna consciousness society has been established for this constant flow of devotional activities. He says that association in devotional activities is just like the waves of an incessantly flowing river. In our Krishna consciousness society we have full engagement 24 hours a day. Every moment of our time is always busily engaged in the service of the Lord. This is called the incessant flow of devotional service. Prabhupada is explaining just what one should be looking for when one attains association of devotees. One should be looking for that opportunity, as Prabhupada says here also in this commentary, to make progress on this path. He quotes the verse\n\n\n\tsatam prasangan mama virya-samvido\n\tbhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani\n\tsraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati\n\tSB 3.25.25\n\n\n\tIn the association of devotees discussions of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead become very pleasing to the ear and enter into the heart. As one advances along that path, then what happens? Gradually he loses his attraction for material things and increases his attachment for Krishna. In that state the real devotion and devotional service begins.\n\n\n\tHe quotes that verse in the commentary, saying that the symptom of real devotional service is when there is attachment for Krishna. That same attachment has to be there for Krishna\u2019s devotees.\n\n\n\tprasangam ajaram pasam\n\tatmanah kavayo viduh\n\tsa eva sadhusu krto\n\tmoksa-dvaram apavrtam\n\tSB 3.25.20\n\n\n\tEvery learned person knows that attachment for material things is the cause of bondage for the living entity. But, when that same attachment is applied to self-realized devotees - moksa-dvaram apavrtam - the gate to liberation has become widely open.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada also speaks about this in the commentary. He said, \u201cMayavadis may ask, oh yes, you are very happy now, you have the association of the devotees, but what is your plan for liberation? You are enjoying now, yes that is very nice, but do you have any plan?\u201d Prabhupada says, \u201cDhruva Maharaja has a very clear answer to this question of the mayavadis. Yes, my plan is to become attached to hearing the pastimes of the Lord.\u201d Because once one becomes attached to hearing the pastimes of the Lord, everything else naturally follows. Simply by becoming attached\u2026\n\n\n\tPrabhupada even says, \u201cLike a person, a drug addict becomes addicted to drugs.\u201d The word used in this verse is mattah. Mattah means mad, nunam pramattah, Lord Rishabhadeva explains, mad after sense gratification. He describes the characteristics of persons who are mad after sense gratification. They become addicted to all kinds of sinful activities. Or Prahlada Maharaja also describes the symptoms of such persons who are mad after sense gratification. He says that they make progress towards hellish conditions of life and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed. They make progress too. Everybody makes progress, when you become mad after something. You become mad after sense gratification? Prahlada Maharaja says, \u201cYes you can make progress towards hellish conditions of life. And you can go on chewing that, which you always had been chewing before and it lost its taste.\u201d He says, \u201cTheir inclination towards Krishna is never aroused even by their own efforts, by the efforts of others or by a combination of both.\u201d\n\n\n\tTherefore Prabhupada explains (he uses this word mattah, which is also presents in this verse in a different way) that in answer to those impersonalists, those mayavadis, who say, \u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d, the response is, \u201cMy plan is to become mad after hearing the topics of Krishna, to become addicted to hearing about Krishna.\u201d\n\n\n\tIn the Tenth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Sukadeva Goswami says to Pariksit Maharaja. He describes characteristics of paramahamsas, who accepted the essence of life, and who are attached to Lord Krishna within the core of their hearts, and He is the only aim of their life. He says, \u201cIt is their nature to speak about the topics of Krishna at every moment, as if they are newer and newer. They are attached to discussing topics of Lord Krishna in the same way as materialists are attached to discussing the topic of women and sex.\u201d\n\n\n\tThis is the example that Sukadeva Goswami gives. They are addicted, just like a materialist is addicted to sense gratification. Why? because they are always absorbed in these things within the core of their hearts. And because they are always absorbed in these things, whatever they see immediately creates a stimulus for such thoughts. If the heart is filled with lusty desires, there is so much stimulus for lusty thoughts. And from lusty thoughts come lusty topics, from lusty topics come lusty actions.\n\n\n\tSo, he explains that they are addicted. Such persons, who are addicted to such topics, mundane topics, they are always discussing these things. But \"paramahamsas, who have accepted the essence of life, are attached to having Lord Krishna within the core of their hearts, and He is the aim of their life.\" That is the characteristic of a devotee of the Lord. For the devotee of the Lord, his aim in life, his progress is \u201cHow much am I proceeding along the path to achieve that goal. Am I making progress in spiritual life? Am I actually associating with devotees?\u201d, because association is more than just simple physical proximity. In fact, we are going to talk about this later today.\n\n\n\tWe started speaking about it yesterday in our talk about \"sanga tyaga\". We were explaining what is bad sanga, but Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura also explains, what is sanga. He says that sanga is not simply physical proximity. There is more to sanga than physical proximity. He gives a beautiful definition of sanga. He quotes Rupa Goswami\u2019s verse from Upadesamrta, dadati pratigrhnati guhyam akhyati prcchati, which means that love is exchanged between devotees by accepting gifts, giving gifts, inquiring confidentially, revealing one\u2018s mind in confidence, accepting prasadam and giving prasadam.\n\n\n\tIt\u2018s not possible to go on to analyze his use of this verse in relationship to association within the few minutes we have left. Nonetheless, he emphasizes the point that sanga begins when these activities are performed with affection. That is sanga, when these activities are performed with the symptoms of love. Symptoms of love and loving exchanges cannot be understood by non-devotees. They can only be understood by devotees; devotees whose aim in life is to please the Supreme Lord.\n\n\n\tJust as we were explaining yesterday, the jnanis cannot be considered devotees. Why? Because the jnanis are not interested in the mercy of the Lord. Jnanis are thinking, \u201cBy my own intelligence, by my knowledge I will achieve perfection. Just as the Supreme has achieved perfection by knowledge, I will achieve the same position.\u201d Therefore they always keep themselves independent from the Supreme, because they think, \u201cI can do it myself.\u201d They keep themselves independent from the mercy of the Lord and the mercy of His devotees, although they may display some small interest in mercy for some time.\n\n\n\tBhaktivinoda Thakura gives the example. He says, \u201cThey may say \u2018Yes, give me some mercy\u2019, but their only interest is to achieve their impersonal realization and to deny the personal existence of the Supreme, to merge into the oneness.\u201d So they take it and then they give it up afterwards. \u201cI don\u2018t need it anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\tWe gave that example of Prabhupada, when he was walking across the ditch. He accepted the hand of the devotee, and then devotee helped him to cross, and then Prabhupada pushed him away. He said this is the mentality of the impersonalists. Impersonalists think, \u201cYes, let me get mercy from the spiritual master, and then I don\u2018t need it anymore.\u201d But a devotee is one who knows he is always dependent on mercy. When he gets the mercy of the Lord, what does he ask for? He asks, \u201cPlease, give me Your mercy and always keep me in the association of Your devotees. They are the receptacles of Your mercy.\u201d It\u2018s not that I\u2018ve achieved the Lord and now it\u2018s just the Lord and me. No, Prabhupada says, \u201cDevotional service here and devotional service in the spiritual world is the same.\u201d If we want to go to the spiritual world, we better be prepared to associate with devotees.\n\n\n\tOf course, the Lord reciprocates in such a way that the devotee sometimes thinks, it\u2018s only Him and the Lord. But the point is that a devotee understands that \u201cAs long as I am here, in this world, I am fully dependent upon Your mercy manifesting in the form of Your devotees. Therefore, please give me the association of those devotees who have this nectar constantly flowing. If I can get caught up in this constant flow of nectar, I may be able even for a few minutes to forget how hungry I am. I may be able to forget how thirsty I am, I may even forget about necessities of life. I may even become free from illusion, temporarily; lamentation, temporarily; fear, maybe temporarily. Therefore, I need that association constantly. I am always dependent.\u201d That is Vaishnava. The Vaishnava knows that he is incessantly, constantly, continuously and always dependent upon the mercy of the Lord and the mercy of the Lord's devotees.\n\n\n\tWhat happens when he becomes greedy, mad? He becomes the receptacle of that mercy. So, Dhruva Maharaja says, \u201cThat\u2018s my plan. You asked me, what my plan is? That\u2018s my plan. My plan is to always keep myself in the association of Krishna\u2018s devotees. That\u2018s all I need.\u201d\n\n\n\tThank you all very much for your association. Hare Krishna.\n\n","nid":"11352"},{

Boston. Sadhaka Class.\n\n\n\t[NRS:] Program me. What would you want me to speak about?\n\n\n\t[A devotee:] Hearing and chanting.\n\n\n\t[NRS:] Hearing and chanting? Ok. Well, I can think of a verse we can speak from. Maybe you can tell me a little bit, in three minutes or less, how things have evolved since this program has begun?\n\n\n\t[A devotee, indistinctly:] We came with that idea in October. I was able to have anyone to help me to run it. The idea is that, first since the time we have started it in October, this process\u2026 We have a gradual progression from levels one to four, with level one as a very beginning with only chanting four rounds.\n\n\n\t[NRS:] When did it start and at what level it is at present?\n\n\n\t[Devotee:] This is week three. Week one: we talk basically, what is the Hare Krsna mantra, where it come from, in the Vedas, little bit about the process of chanting, very very basics, what is the meaning of the mantra. We chanted a round together. Week two. We\u2026 and chanted again as well. I was going to go to reading. Because part of the process is also reading a chapter of Bhagavad-gita each day. We started this week, reading from Bhagavad-gita, basicly reading from introduction of Bhagavad-gita, with what mood one should read Bhagavad Gita. Example of calf and a cow and so on and so forth. Then about three different parts in Bhagavad-gita. Like that\u2026\n\n\n\t[NRS:] Okay\u2026 When you said, \u201cHearing and chanting\u201d, it made me think of a verse that I spoke on not a long ago. Somebody else asked me to speak from this verse. So, it\u2019s a good verse about hearing and chanting. Maybe we can just read it and talk about it? It is actually from 11th Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, Chapter 3, Text 30:\u00a0\n\n\n\tparasparanukathanam\u2028pavanam bhagavad-yasah\u2028mitho ratir mithas tustir\u2028nivrttir mitha atmanah\n\n\n\tTranslation\n\n\n\t\u201cOne should learn how to associate with the devotees of the Lord by gathering with them to chant the glories of the Lord. This process is most purifying. As devotees thus develop their loving friendship, they feel mutual happiness and satisfaction. And by thus encouraging one another they are able to give up material sense gratification, which is the cause of all suffering.\u201d [End of translation.]\n\n\n\tA good verse, isn\u2019t it? Yes? You like it? Okay.\n\n\n\tPurport\n\n\n\tAccording to Srila Sridhara Svami, those who are advanced in Krsna consciousness should not envy one another or quarrel among themselves. Giving up all such mundane feelings, they should gather together and chant the glories of the Supreme Lord for mutual purification. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has pointed out that glorification of the Supreme Lord is especially potent when performed in the association of pure devotees. When devotees engage in sankirtana, chanting the glories of the Lord together, they experience the highest transcendental bliss and satisfaction. Thus they encourage one another to give up material sense gratification, which is based on illicit sexual connections with women. One devotee will say to another, \u201cOh, you have given up sense gratification. Starting today, I shall also give it up.\u201d\n\n\n\tOne should learn to increase one\u2019s love for the devotees, to satisfy them and to give up sense objects unfavorable to serving Krsna. And one should learn to view the entire universe as paraphernalia for the Lord\u2019s service. By engaging the objects of the senses in Krsna\u2019s service, one automatically becomes detached from them. And as one passes one\u2019s days in the association of the Lord\u2019s devotees, one\u2019s transcendental ecstasy increases more and more, through discussions about the topics of Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. Therefore, one who wants to be free from the harassment of maya in the form of sense gratification must constantly associate with pure devotees of the Lord who have no engagement other than chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord and carrying out His mission on earth.\n\n\n\tSrila Madhvacarya has pointed out that just as one should cultivate friendship with devotees, one must cultivate a spirit of friendship toward the demigods, who manage the universe on the Lord\u2019s behalf. Thus one should live peacefully within this world. [End of purport.]\n\n\n\tAny questions? I can talk more. I\u2019m just curious if anyone has any questions yet.\n\n\n\t[Devotee:] You said something about carrying out Lords mission\u2026 can you explain that?\n\n\n\t[NRS:] At the very end of the commentary, you mean?\n\n\n\t[Devotee:] Right.\n\n\n\t[NRS:] \u201cTherefore, one who wants to be free from the harassment of\u00a0maya\u00a0in the form of sense gratification must constantly associate with pure devotees of the Lord who have no engagement other than chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord and carrying out His mission on earth.\u201d\n\n\n\t[Devotee:] I\u2019m trying to understand \u201cThe mission on earth.\u201d\n\n\n\t[NRS:] Well, let\u2019s try to answer that question, but include it in the essence of the topic of the verse as well. Krsna comes, obviously, for many purposes. Queen Kunti in her prayers gives many reasons for the Lord\u2019s appearance. Certainly, as He Himself says, He comes to re-establish the principles of religion, paritranaya sadhunam - to deliver the devotees, annihilate the miscreants and re-establish principles of religion.\n\n\n\tSo, the Lord has different missions according to different times and according to different circumstances, but we should understand that the mission that is described here, in this commentary, refers to the verse itself. Queen Kunti says that one of the reasons why Krsna appears is to renovate the principles of hearing and chanting about Him, because when He appears in this world, He engages in many wonderful transcendental activities, which are later recorded in the form of scripture and then later discussed by His devotees. When His devotees are discussing His activities, which are always transcendental, it is understood that such topics of the Lord are non-different from the Lord Himself. Therefore, to discuss His transcendental activities is also absolute and has the same potency as if Krsna Himself was present. Therefore, there are verses such as:\n\n\n\tnaham tisthami vaikunthe\u2028yoginam hrdayesu va\u2028tatra tisthami narada\u2028yatra gayanti mad-bhaktah\n\n\n\tKrsna says to Narada, \u201cNarada, I am not in the Vaikuntha planets, nor am I in the hearts of yogis, but wherever My devotees are discussing My glories. That\u2019s where I go. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find Me.\u201d (Padma Purana)\n\n\n\tIn other words, when the devotees are purely, and here the reference is given in the commentary, when devotees are endeavouring to purely speak of Krsna\u2019s pastimes for no other purpose than to glorify Him. They want to simply hear the topics of the Supreme Lord and glorify the Supreme Lord. They have no other agenda. So when it\u2019s done purely, without any other motivations and free from envy, which is also spoken about in the commentary, Krsna becomes very attracted to that place where such topics are discussed. Therefore, being attracted He says, \u201cI come, I go there. You\u2019ll find Me there. I manifest there.\u201d Therefore Krsna\u2019s purpose, His mission in this world is fulfilled by those devotees who discuss His pastimes and hear them purely. Purity, of course, is a very important quality. Purity means there is no motivation other than to please the Lord. So, how to achieve that state of purity? Bhagavatam also says:\u00a0\n\n\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya\u2028vasudeva-katha-rucih\u2028syan mahat-sevaya viprah\u2028punya-tirtha-nisevanat\n\n\n\t\u201cBy serving devotees who are freed from vice, great service is done. By that service one develops attraction for hearing and chanting about Krsna.\u201d (SB 1.2.16)\n\n\n\tTherefore we see, for example, Krsna says in the Bhagavad Gita:\n\n\n\tya idam paramam guhyam\u2028mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati\n\n\n\t\u201cFor one who explains the supreme secret about devotional service to others, for him this devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he comes back to Me. There is no servant in this world that is more dear to Me nor will there ever be one more dear.\u201d (BG 18.68)\n\n\n\tKrsna establishes very clearly right in Bhagavad Gita that His mission, mission of those who are most confidential and dear servants, is to tell others about Him. What service can we render to those who are engaged in spreading the glories of the Lord and telling others about Him? The first service, we can render, is hearing from them, because, what is the most important way to serve somebody who is spreading the glories of the Lord? First is hearing. Prabhupada explains: sravanam, kirtanam, visnu smaranam. First is hearing, and when one has heard then what happens?\n\n\n\tsatam prasangan mama virya-samvido\u2028bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah\n\n\n\tWhen one hears, it goes into the ear, when it goes into the ear, then it goes into the heart. Then, when it goes into the heart:\n\n\n\ttaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani\u2028sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati\n\n\n\tIt goes into the ear then it goes into the heart. Then one gradually gives up attraction to this material world, his attachment to Krsna becomes fixed and then his devotional service begins. (SB 3.25.25)\n\n\n\tSo, very important service\u2026 sometimes people they have this fixed conception in their mind that, when they have heard from somebody, then they need a mission, they need\u2026 \u201cWhat\u2019s my service? What\u2019s my mission? What am I going to do?\u201d They start thinking that mission means doing something with the body. If they don\u2019t go on hearing, then sometimes due to impurities that are still within the heart \u2013 anarthas, a lot of anarthas, unwanted things within the heart \u2013 if one doesn\u2019t go on hearing, then one can lose sight of the goal of the service.\n\n\n\tTherefore, in this verse, we\u2019ve just quoted, it is stated: sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati, hearing has to be there from sraddha all the way to prema. This hearing is not something that is given up at any stage. From sraddha, which is the beginning - sraddha means that faith is awakened within the heart - to sadhu sanga, associating with the devotees, then to bhajana kriya. Bhajana kriya means engaging in the service or worship. Bhajana kriya specifically means the processes of:\n\n\n\tsravanam kirtanam visnoh\u2028smaranam pada-sevanam\u2028arcanam vandanam dasyam\u2028sakhyam atma-nivedanam\n\n\n\tNine processes of devotional service.\n\n\n\tSometimes we think that bhajana kriya means\u2026 Yes, these other things are relevant, the other types of service that one can do: giving donations to the temple, so many other things, unlimited things that one can do. They are purifying and beneficial. But bhajana kriya means to actually engage in one, two, or even all nine processes of devotional service beginning with hearing and chanting. Then what happens after this bhajana kriya, beginning with hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord? The next stage is anartha nivritti.\n\n\n\tAnartha nivritti means that the anarthas become cleansed from the heart gradually and then... I\u2019ve only got an hour, a little bit more than 40 minutes to spend, so I am not going to give a very, very detailed description, I am giving only a general topic. Then the next stage is nistha. Nistha means that attachment becomes fixed, one becomes convinced. When one comes to that stage of nistha, then gradually one gets ruci, one gets some taste, he extracts some taste, a higher taste and that taste is steady, consistent. Then from the attachment asakti is the next stage, then bhava and then prema.\n\n\n\tIn all of these stages, from sraddha to prema, pure love of God, there is always hearing about Krsna, except that it becomes deeper, it becomes thicker, it becomes more relishable, and therefore devotees never give up this process of hearing and chanting. But most important in the beginning stage, there must be hearing. That is devotional service.\n\n\n\tSometimes people who are too much motivated think that, \u201cI am going to do something really big so that I can get somebody\u2019s attention. I\u2019ve got to do something that shows the big results, big this, big that\u201d. They get so much into thinking of the results, of the big thing. But the real big result is supposed to take place right here, in the heart. That\u2019s the big result that we are actually supposed to offer-- it is a clean heart. Because when there is a clean heart, then one becomes very potent, and one can actually become very instrumental to the Lord\u2019s mission. Very instrumental\u2026 When the heart is clean, pure. So, how is it going to be clean?\n\n\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya\u2028vasudeva-katha-rucih (SB 1.2.16)\n\n\n\tWe have to serve devotees who are freed from vice. Then great service is done. By that service we develop an affinity for hearing more and more.\n\n\n\tSo yes, we should go on and do service to the devotees who are freed from vice. We should assist them in their mission, which is spreading the glories of the Lord. But also we should not neglect that all these services are supposed to awaken our attraction for hearing about Krsna, without which srama eva hi kevalam (SB 1.2.8) we are wasting our time.\n\n\n\tIt\u2019s said in the Bhagavatam :\n\n\n\tdharmah svanusthitah pumsam\u2028visvaksena-kathasu yah\u2028notpadayed yadi ratim\u2028srama eva hi kevalam\n\n\n\tThe verse basically says that even if one engages in his occupational duties but he doesn\u2019t awaken attraction to hearing and chanting, then he is wasting his time, srama eva hi kevalam.\n\n\n\tThat is the Lord\u2019s mission, and those who are sincere servants of the Lord they continue His mission by discussing His activities and pastimes in this world in the association of others, who are eager to hear such transcendental narrations. The more one goes on hearing the more that desire is awakened within the heart to tell others, and then the Lord's mission continues. So that is the Lord\u2019s mission, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s applied in a very general way to the process of hearing and chanting.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tTherefore we\u2019ve tried to place emphasis on a very important point that at no stage from sraddha \u2013 the very first stage \u2013 all the way to ecstatic love of God, manifesting in all the asta-sattvika bhavas, at no stage does one ever neglect hearing about Krsna. Because, those persons who are situated on the topmost platform of devotional service,\n\n\n\tprayena munayo rajan\u2028nivrtta vidhi-sedhatah\u2028nairgunya-stha ramante sma\u2028gunanukathane hareh\n\n\n\tThe topmost transcendentalists, Bhagavatam states, the topmost transcendentalists derive their greatest pleasure from always hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. That\u2019s their ecstasy, that\u2019s their bliss. Obviously Krsna is very pleased by their state of consciousness.\n\n\n\tSo, even when one comes to the topmost stage, hearing and chanting goes on. What to speak of the beginning stage, when the heart is still filled with so many unwanted things? What is going to clean it? And that\u2019s what this verse is all about: \u201cOne should learn how to associate with the devotees of the Lord by gathering with them to chant the glories of the Lord. This process is most purifying.\u201d Not even said \u2018more pure\u2019, it\u2019s most purifying!\n\n\n\tAs devotees develop their loving friendship, they feel mutual happiness and satisfaction. When devotees get together to discuss, then they actually begin to experience what is the real basis of friendship amongst devotees. It\u2019s not physical proximity, it\u2019s not working together. Sometimes we say, \u201cYes, I\u2019m with devotees all the time. I am up here, she is over there, he is over there, they are over there, we are in the same building together, and every time we cross, we think how to avoid each other. But I am always associating with devotees!\u201d No, association is not a physical proximity. If association would mean physical proximity, we\u2019d all be pretty pure! It\u2019s not just physical proximity, it\u2019s more to it than that.\n\n\n\tSometimes devotees say, \u201cYes, I work with devotees in the same place. We do the same business together\u201d, and things like that. But what do they talk about? They talk about taxes; they talk about profit, this and that. Yes, there is some association, but what is association? Association is mac-citta mad-gata-prana bodhayantah parasparam (Bg10.9) hearing and discussing topics related to Lord Krsna. That is association. Therefore, when one actually begins to associate on this platform, then the whole paradigm of day to day identifying with one another according to the different roles we play in the material world, the whole paradigm gets smashed.\n\n\n\tWe tend to see people according to the roles we play in social intercourse. If we're not careful, we start thinking, \u201cHe does this, he does that. I don\u2019t like the way he does that, I don\u2019t like the way she does this\u201d, and we start categorizing people according to the habits we don\u2019t like about them. Because we play different social roles and because the material world is not completely harmonious, we become disharmonious. We avoid doing anything together which would break down this barrier, and which would allow us to see each other as a servant of Krsna.\n\n\n\tWhat allows us to see each other for who we really are (or should be) is seeing others as devotees who want to become purified by the process of hearing and chanting about Krsna. When we associate with each other on that platform, it is very purifying. What happens is that friendship begins to strengthen, there is a bonding because there is communality between everybody. \u201cYes, we are all in this together. We are all in this together! We are all trying to become purified by hearing and chanting about Krsna.\u201d\n\n\n\tTherefore, in the commentary it says, \u201cAccording to Srila Sridhar Swami, those who are advanced in Krsna consciousness should not envy one another or quarrel among themselves. Giving up all such mundane feelings, they should gather together and chant the glories of the Supreme Lord for mutual purification.\u201d Here it is in a nutshell! He said, \u201cGive up all these mundane feelings, \u2018He did this, she said that, I don\u2019t like the way he did this, I don\u2019t like to listen\u2026 Well I\u2019m doing all this, and what is she doing? I am working so hard but they are just not doing anything.\u2019\u201d All these different attitudes build up, and as soon as you see somebody the only thing you see is the attitude, because you don\u2019t see anything else. You see your own attitude towards them and that\u2019s what happens.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada says, \u201cFamiliarity breeds contempt.\u201d Prabhupada even said that about his own disciple who was very close to him. He said, \u201cActually he became too familiar, and familiarity breeds contempt.\u201d And what happens? In the same way you become too familiar and start thinking, \u201cThey are ordinary people, they are doing\u2026\u201d and then you don\u2019t want to associate with them anymore. But when you associate with each other by hearing and chanting, these feelings can be put aside because there's a higher goal, a higher objective. Not only that, it\u2019s purifying. It\u2019s very purifying. And what comes out is the feeling like, \u201cWow, there is some benefit being around these people. I don\u2019t have to hide in my room all the time and try to avoid them in the hallway.\u201d\n\n\n\tTherefore, there is so much emphasis, \u201cYes, come to class!\u201d \u2013 \u201cNo, not to class. I am too busy doing this, doing that.\u201d \u201cNo, this is it. This is what it is all for \u2013 to sit in front of Radha-Gopivallabha and hear and chant about Them, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, that\u2019s what the building is here for, otherwise what\u2019s the value?\u201d It\u2019s not here to run around, working hard, doing this, doing that and forgetting the whole goal. So, this is the importance of being a sadhaka and actually putting emphasis on hearing and chanting. And I think my time is up...\n\n\n\t[Devotee:] (indistinct)\n\n\n\t[NRS:] But this is what association means. This is actually supposed to awaken an inspiration, not pain. It is painful, because\u2026 What is it? What is it, the verse? Rupa Goswami, \u201cUpadesamrita\u201d, verse Seven:\n\n\n\t\u201cHoly Name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are all naturally sweet, but one who has been afflicted by the jaundice of avidya tastes it as very bitter. Therefore it\u2019s very wonderful that if one goes on very carefully chanting these sweet names of the Lord, very carefully chanting every day, then a natural relish awakens within the tongue and the disease becomes destroyed at the root.\u201d\n\n\n\tSo it is painful sometimes. Like a person who has jaundice \u2013 it\u2019s painful to eat sugar. Therefore, we are all in the same condition. It\u2019s not that anyone is exempt. We are all in the same condition. It\u2019s painful for all of us. But if we stay fixed on what is the purpose, what is the goal, why did I come, why was I attracted to Prabhupada\u2019s books, why was I attracted to visiting the temple, why was I attracted in the first place, we'll remember why we are here. If we are not careful we may forget, very easily forget, because that\u2019s the nature of the material world.\n\n\n\tTherefore, daily hearing and chanting about Krsna is supposed to serve as a constant reminder, and in the beginning stages it is a process of purification, but gradually, as one advances on the path, it becomes very relishable. And relish - that is of course, as we said, in the more advanced stages of relishing that sweet taste of Krsna\u2019s name, form, qualities and pastimes, but it works. It works, when the motive is correct.\n\n\n\tI remember seeing sometimes in the temples that had strict policies requiring all residents to attend class, that some devotees would come, but resentfully. They would make sure they were busy doing something else during class so that they didn\u2019t have to hear. But since their bodies were there, nobody challenged them. \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m in the temple room,\u201d \u2013 but they are doing something else, their mind is not even\u2026 Don\u2019t want to hear, stubborn, just stubborn, don\u2019t want to hear... Their excuse is, \u201cIt\u2019s not inspiring. I am not inspired to hear this person.\u201d But here is a very interesting point; it\u2019s brought out here in the purport. It says that devotees gather for mutual purification. Everybody comes for the same reason\u2026 wanting to hear, but can also discuss.\u00a0\n\n\n\tIf we actually have a desire to hear something, we may actually hear something from somebody who not necessarily may be such an inspirational speaker, but it may resonate with something that we really have a strong desire for. A part of our bhajan, a part of our daily service is supposed to be praying for answers, to increase our understanding. Krsna is within the heart. Sometimes He can arrange for a very profound message to come from somebody else\u2019s mouth that you never even expected it to come from. Because we desired it, Krsna arranged it to come from somebody else\u2019s mouth.\n\n\n\tI\u2019ve had that situation. Sometimes I\u2019ve heard things from a non-devotee, and it was profound, completely profound! It really just depends on our earnest and fervent desire to catch something that is relevant to our spiritual life. It\u2019s also based upon our own desire to hear, to find answers and to get inspiration. So, again, it is not just the principle of being physically present. It\u2019s also hearing and cultivating the desire to hear more and more for the purpose of increasing our attachment to the lotus feet of the Lord. The result from having adequately heard is that the desire to serve the Lord becomes naturally awakened within the heart.\n\n\n\tThat\u2019s all on the process of hearing and chanting. And we are supposed to chant japa together, right? One round together and then end at eleven o\u2019clock. Should we see if anyone else has any question? Is this painful for everyone?\n\n\n\t[Another devotee:] (not clear) What happens is that we get lost in a mundane way of doing things. We begin with intense chanting. And then it does happen in fact, while chanting and while listening, it becomes mundane. It becomes mundane, it becomes routine. So when it becomes routine, at that point you can move all the\u2026 The factors of doing it. Because then it becomes .... you are simply looking for something else and your Hare Krsna japa is ruined...\u00a0 So you are returning from Himalayas... You have to get back on to focusing on that, on mantra.\n\n\n\t[NRS:] In other words, you are just confirming what I said?\n\n\n\t[Another devotee:] Exactly. It\u2019s natural.\n\n\n\t[NRS:] Of course, it happens to everybody. Why do you think I am able to speak about it so distinctly? But we have to at least be aware of it. One of the anarthas is not to be aware of the pitfalls of devotional service. It\u2019s called tattva-vibrahma. It\u2019s an anartha. It\u2019s not to know, what the pitfalls are and to stay ignorant of it. The best way to clear that anartha is to know what are the pitfalls so that we can consciously try to avoid them while engaged in sadhana.\u00a0 Therefore, sometimes we have to bring out these painful topics.\n\n\n\tOkay. Hare Krsna. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. I guess we chant japa now, one round.\n\n","nid":"11348"},{

I haven\u2019t been here in St. Petersburg for eight years. I used to make an annual pilgrimage here which began twenty-five years ago. I've been away too long. I am relieved. I'm very fond of coming here. As soon as I got out of the airport and began driving through the streets, I began reflecting on those memories. Not all of them were good, some were difficult, some were funny - like my confrontation with a KGB agent. It was here in Leningrad in 1989. He grabbed my scarf, started tightening it around my neck and said, \u201cAre you an anarchist?\u201d I replied \u201cI do tend to be a little independent at times.Why do you ask?\u201d He made some kind of remark like, \u201cPeople who wear purple scarves in the Soviet Union are anarchists.\u201d\n\n\n\tAt that time I didn\u2019t know that this wasn\u2019t true, but he was tightening the scarf around my neck. He then stopped, threw it in my face and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching you.\u201d But that was the last day of my tour. I was flying from Leningrad to Warsaw. He didn\u2019t bother me anymore after that. I wasn\u2019t here. But it was one of my memories here. Most of them were very memorable. Different places I preached in, different halls and different flats I preached in and especially the devotees I met - I have fond memories of all of them. I hope to see some of them here as I do \u2013 Gargacharya Prabhu, Sri Nathaji Prabhu, who were here back in those days. Who else?\n\n\n\tThank you for receiving me. I\u2019m going to do a bit of speaking from the Teachings of Queen Kunti. For several weeks I\u2019ve been speaking from this book. From time to time I like to read and speak from it. In some of the places I\u2019ve been travelling to, I shared my reasons for my attraction to the lectures from this book. I\u2019ll share some of them with you today. I do it only because I feel that I want to increase you appreciation for these lectures that Srila Prabhupada gave in the early 1970's in Los Angeles. Of course, all of his lectures are brilliant and deeply devotional but these particular lectures had a very deep impression on me because Prabhupada was giving them at the same time I started coming to the Krsna consciousness movement.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada was speaking from the prayers of Queen Kunti from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1. Every day he would speak from a verse from these prayers. Although Prabhupada was in Los Angeles at that time, I was on the east coast; I wasn\u2019t personally there to hear these lectures. During those days when Prabhupada would give a lecture, devotees would immediately record it and\u00a0 then send it out very quickly to different places throughout the world. One Godbrother of mine, his name was Kesava (I have very fond memories of him also) shared some of those cassettes with me when I was visiting the temple. The only contact I had with Srila Prabhupada \u2013 except for his books - was through these cassette recordings. There was one particular lecture, the first one he gave me, which I took home and was listening to every day.\n\n\n\tAt that time it was very difficult for me to understand Srila Prabhupada\u2019s accent. His English is, of course, perfect but nonetheless he has this Bengali accent and for my ear it was very difficult to understand. I went with the cassette-player, rewound and played it again and again listening to every single thing that he said. For me it was like a daily event - listening to this lecture and slowly every day going through the lecture, one little piece at a time. There was one particular point that Prabhupada made in one particular lecture that struck me very deeply. It was a short section of the lecture but it had a deep impression on my heart.\n\n\n\tIn fact, in the Baltic festival last week, I gave a series of lectures on that short quote. Prabhupada had said that in the material world there would always be difficulties. We should not expect peace as long as we are in the material world. Being in the material world is like being in the middle of the ocean. Without any warning at any time there could be disturbance created by the waves. Therefore, a devotee should take shelter of Krsna, take shelter of service to Krsna, because in the beginning there will be a lot of tests by maya. Maya is Krsna\u2019s agent. As Krsna\u2019s agent, she will be testing each and every one of us to see if we are coming to Krsna to serve Him or to disturb Him. I remember when I heard that, because I was just coming to Krsna consciousness, and Prabhupada specifically stated in the beginning that there will be many tests. He warned that maya, as Krsna\u2019s agent, will come to see if I\u2019m sincere or if I wanted to disturb Krsna.\n\n\n\tI really accepted those words in my heart and I felt that they were directed to me, or in other words, that Prabhupada was personally speaking to me. I felt sheltered because I was thinking, \u201cWell, now I know that if any disturbances will come, it will be maya testing me.\u201d I had strength from that, knowing at least what it was going to be because sometimes things happen to us and we don\u2019t know why they are happening. But I had Prabhupada\u2019s explanation as to why it was going to happen. So, I felt, \u201cOK, I\u2019m ready for maya.\u201d As soon as there will be a test, I will immediately say, \u201cWell, I know who you are. You are maya and Krsna sent you to test me. You want to see if I\u2019ve come to serve Krsna or disturb Krsna, right? Well, I\u2019m going to show you that I\u2019m coming to serve Krsna.\u201d I felt completely empowered on the strength of those words.\n\n\n\tAnd surely, after I got that lecture from my Godbrother and listened to it very carefully (of course, I had also read Srila Prabhupada\u2019s Bhagavad-gita and the 1st Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam), I moved into the temple. To me, that\u2019s what Prabhupada meant by \"the beginning\" - I just assumed it had meant when I moved into the temple.\n\n\n\tWhen I moved into the temple, there were no tests. It was just completely blissful. It was difficult before moving into the temple because there were a lot of attachments I had to give up. I spoke about that when I was in Lithuania two or three days ago. One of the attachments was my dog. Anyway, I got over that pretty quickly. I was saying, \u201cOK, maya, test me.\u201d And there were no tests. I went for a few weeks thinking, \u201cWhat was Prabhupada talking about? He said that in the beginning there were going to be a lot of tests, and I don't see it, don't hear it, nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\tGradually one thing started to become a little bit difficult for me and that was getting up for mangala-arati. After a few weeks I started to realize that three o\u2019clock in the morning was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. Every day it started to become a little bit more difficult. The temple commander was a former Air Force sergeant. He lost his arm in the military in Vietnam. He only had one arm but still he was pretty strong. Just as I remembered some words of Srila Prabhupada, he also remembered some words of Srila Prabhupada. The words he remembered were, \u201cWhen you come to Krsna consciousness you should surrender as if in a military fashion.\u201d He quoted it often. In the commentary to Bhagavad-gita Prabhupada says that.\n\n\n\tOf course, he was the person who was getting me up for mangala-arati. He started to adopt drastic measures for getting me up. I won\u2019t tell you all the things he did, you might wonder about the early days of ISKCON but it included throwing water on me and shaking me out of the sleeping bag. One morning I specifically remember it was very-very difficult and I hit my fist against the floor and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d For some reason I had forgotten that I was prepared for maya\u2019s test. I was ready for it before, but now when it came I for some reason completely forgot about it. At that particular point I had that resolve, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\tI was thinking that I was going to leave the temple but then all of a sudden, right at that moment, those words resonated in my heart. I heard them because I played them so many times on the tape recorder. I could hear Prabhupada\u2019s voice that - in the beginning there will be so many disturbances that maya will be testing you to see if you sincerely come to serve or disturb Krsna. Right at that moment I felt like Prabhupada was massaging my heart. It was very illuminating. I made the connection finally between the test and Prabhupada\u2019s words. It was right at that point when I realized that Prabhupada saved me. From that morning on I was able to overcome that difficulty of getting up in the morning.\n\n\n\tOf course, that was my first real test. It\u2019s not that they all ended after that. As all of you know, maya is always ready to test us every step of the way. The stronger we get, the stronger she apparently gets. Her tests become more and more subtle. So it\u2019s not just in the beginning that maya is going to test us to see if we come to serve Krsna or to disturb Krsna. They will be all the way until we actually become completely pure. This was one lecture that Prabhupada gave from the Teachings of Queen Kunti that I was listening to at that time. My Godbrother Kesava used to share with me many of those lectures that Prabhupada was giving at that time. Those lectures were like my daily nourishment in my early days of Krsna consciousness.\n\n\n\tThe word is pusti, nourishment, like a person gets nourishment from eating good food. We also have to get strength and nourishment from the words of Srila Prabhupada. Those lectures, therefore, have very deep meaning for me because of the nourishment I got during those early days. Of course, I got a lot of nourishment from the temple devotees as well. My Godbrother Kesava just recently departed from this world, just a few months ago. I am very much indebted to him. It was very painful when I learned that he departed because I had not seen him since 1973. He was visiting in Boston temple from San Francisco at that time. He had a lot of association with Prabhupada because he was a very senior devotee.\n\n\n\tHe was very personal. The way he treated me was unforgettable. He had a lot of association with Prabhupada. Although he looked very fixed up in Krsna consciousness to me, he never looked down on me. He never preached down to me. He was just like a friend. For me that friendship was transformational. As soon as I would come to the temple, immediately he was there, he took me to his room, we talked, and he told me stories about Prabhupada. And this is also funny. Prabhupada would often give the example, that if you are nice to the dog of a person, immediately you get the attention of a person. He once quoted \u2018Love me, love my dog\u2019 when he talked about the spiritual master as Krsna\u2019s representative.\n\n\n\tSo, whenever I came to the temple (because I couldn\u2019t bring my dog into the temple) Kesava would often throw capatis out of the window for my dog. It captured my heart. He asked, \u201cWhere is your dog?\u201d \u201cI left her outside. She is out there waiting for me.\u201d \u201cWhich side of the building is she?\u201d \u201cThat side.\u201d So he would go to the window with the stack of chapatis and throw them out. He was a very, very warm, friendly person.When I was visiting the temple at that time I had very long hair, I was a hippie. I used to think, \u201cWhat did I do to deserve so much attention from him?\u201d And he never wanted anything. He just wanted to talk with me.\n\n\n\tIn fact, the reason why I joined was because of him. He told me, \u201cYou are a preacher. I can see that you are a preacher. You should travel and preach with me. Whenever you decide that you want to join, just come with me. We\u2019ll travel and preach together.\u201d I didn\u2019t join right away. Just before he left the temple, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to South America, to Guyana. Nobody has ever preached there before. I am going there to start preaching. When you decide you want to join, come down there and we will travel together.\u201d When I finally did get the determination to join, I came to the temple with this in mind -that I\u2019m coming to get my head shaved and to get my robes. I also had enough money for the ticket to go with Kesava to Guyana.\n\n\n\tI came to the temple and said, \u201cI want to join Prabhupada\u2019s mission and Kesava said he wants me to preach with him.\u201d The temple leader said, \u201cYou are not going anywhere.\u201d \u201cBut Kesava is waiting for me.\u201d \u201cYou are surrendering to Krsna, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYes, I surrender to Krsna.\u201d \u201cThen give us your money.\u201d He took all my money and said, \u201cYou are staying here.\u201d I never saw Kesava again. Forty years. I never saw him again. I was never able to thank him because I never travelled to South America. Although I did go to Guyana once, he was living in some other place in South America. It was very painful for me when I heard that he departed because I never was able to personally thank him. Anyway, this is the story that came to my mind at the lecture. We should always feel very grateful to those devotees who are instrumental in helping us come to Srila Prabhupada\u2019s lotus feet. He is one devotee to whom I am extremely grateful.\n\n\n\tI\u2019m going to read from Teachings of Queen Kunti and we\u2019ll speak a little bit from these lectures.\n\tChapter Twelve \u201cBewildering Pastimes\u201d\n\n\n\tna veda kascid bhagavams cikirsitam\n\ttavehamanasya nrnam vidambanam\n\tna yasya kascid dayito 'sti karhicid\n\tdvesyas ca yasmin visama matir nrnam\n\n\n\t\u201cO Lord, no one can understand Your transcendental pastimes, which appear to be human and are so misleading. You have no specific object of favor, nor do You have any object of envy. People only imagine that You are partial.\u201d (SB 1.8.29)\n\n\n\tPurport by SrilaPrabhupada\n\n\n\tThe Lord\u2019s mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of hostility. The very conception of the Personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. His pastimes appear to be exactly like a human being\u2019s, but actually they are transcendental and without any tinge of material contamination. He is undoubtedly known as partial to His pure devotees, but in fact He is never partial, as much as the sun is never partial to anyone. By utilizing the sunrays, sometimes even the stones become valuable, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun, although there are enough sunrays before him. Darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in distributing its rays. The sunrays are open to everyone, but the capacities of the receptacles differ. Foolish people think that devotional service is flattering the Lord to get special mercy. Factually the pure devotees who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are not a mercantile community. A mercantile house renders service to someone in exchange for values. The pure devotee does not render service unto the Lord for such exchange, and therefore the full mercy of the Lord is open for him.\n\n\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\n\n\n\tAs we said, these prayers are very beautiful. Queen Kunti-devi is revealing the depth of her heart in her prayers to Krsna. She is perfectly displaying her completely unmotivated service to Him. This is a very common thing that Srila Prabhupada speaks about in his commentaries and in his lectures. Of course, Srila Prabhupada always speaks about unmotivated devotional service because it is the duty of the acharya, when speaking, to preach the glories of devotional service in the beginning, middle and end\u2014 everywhere in Srimad Bhagavatam to enunciate these glories.\n\n\n\tSometimes when we read Srila Prabhupada\u2019s commentaries we might wonder how it is that Srila Prabhupada always seems to present everything in terms of pure devotional service. Obviously it\u2019s because he understood that the purpose of all the scriptures is to bring us to the platform of pure devotional service. He knew the purpose behind Narada Muni\u2019s instructions to Vyasadeva. When Vyasadeva was feeling dissatisfaction because he had neglected to adequately glorify the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Narada instructed him to present the Srimad Bhagavatam. Therefore, we see consistently everywhere in Srila Prabhupada's commentaries that the glories of pure devotional service are always expanded. He speaks a lot in these lectures about unmotivated, devotional service to Krsna.\n\n\n\tSometimes we may think that it is difficult to always hear about unmotivated devotional service. We think, \u201cThat\u2019s way up there and I am down here. If I always hear about unmotivated service, I\u2019ll get discouraged because I am not unmotivated.\u201d Or we may think, \u201cKrsna\u2019s asking too much for unmotivated devotional service.\u201d Or we may think, \u201cHearing about unmotivated devotional service somehow doesn\u2019t resonate in my heart because my heart is filled with so many desires, therefore when I hear about the unmotivated devotional service it doesn\u2019t do anything to me.\u201d Actually, these phenomena are explained in the Bhagavatam. In the 1st Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam,\n\n\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam (SB 1.2.17)\n\n\n\t\u201cKrsna who is the Supersoul in the heart of all living beings cleanses the desire for material enjoyment in the heart of those persons who develops the urge to hear His messages which are themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.\u201d\n\n\n\tThe Bhagavatam states that Krsna cleans the hearts of those who develop the urge to hear the Bhagavatam. Therefore, when one hears the glories of pure devotional service, it\u2019s supposed to act in this way\u2014 cleaning the heart \u2014but sometimes the cleaning is painful. In the process of cleaning sometimes we see that the dirt in our hearts starts to come to the surface.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada gives the example of ghee. When you put butter on a low flame, it starts boiling gradually - you see the things that you didn\u2019t see before. You never knew that all of these impurities were there when you first melted the butter. But if you keep it on the flame, you\u2019ll see ph-ph-ph start coming to the surface and you start recognizing, \u201cWow! I didn\u2019t know it was there.\u201d\n\n\n\tAnybody who makes pure ghee knows that you have to use a ladle with holes in it to take the impurities off the top and separate them from the pure ghee. Prabhupada says that purification is like this. Cleansing the heart means that all of the impurities start to come to the surface. Therefore, in His instructions to Srila Rupa Goswami, Lord Caitanya explains that upon receiving the Holy Name of the Lord from the spiritual master, or in other words, when the seed of devotion is planted in the heart, one has to continue the watering process. The watering process waters both the devotional creeper as well as the weeds that are there within the heart. Lord Caitanya says that one has to discriminate between the devotional plant and the weeds that can choke the devotional plant. If one doesn\u2019t discriminate properly and can\u2019t see \u201cthis is the seed of the devotional plant and these are the weeds,\u201d one will mistakenly continue to water the weeds. Although the weeds were barely visible before, all of a sudden they begin to grow faster and can choke that plant. If you have ever cultivated a garden, you must have had that experience - that weeds tend to grow everywhere and if you don\u2019t pull out the weeds, there won\u2019t be sufficient nourishment for the plant. They\u2019ll take all the nourishment for themselves and the plants will become unhealthy, they will wither and eventually die.\n\n\n\tSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakura describes it in a different way, \u201cWhen sraddha takes birth in the heart, it\u2019s like the appearance of a new-born baby-girl.\u201d What is sraddha? Sraddha is the seed of bhakti. It\u2019s faith in pure devotional service. That\u2019s what initially attracts us, that faith in pure devotional service. Those who preach the glories of pure devotional service can awaken that faith of pure devotional service in the hearts of those who previously had no faith. I remember one lecture Prabhupada gave on the verse,\n\n\n\tsusrusoh sraddadhanasya\n\tvasudeva-katha-rucih\n\tsyan mahat-sevaya viprah\n\tpunya-tirtha-nisevanat (SB 1.2.16)\n\n\n\tBy serving devotees who are completely free from vice great service is done. By such service one develops the affinity for hearing the glories of pure devotional service.\n\n\n\tIn this lecture Srila Prabhupada said something very profound. He said, \u201cI have created your faith.\u201d In other words, as Bhaktivinoda Thakura said that sraddha is like a birth of a new-born baby girl, Srila Prabhupada says, \u201cI have impregnated you and now a baby girl (faith) is taking birth.\u201d Because Prabhupada is potent, therefore, he can impregnate or awaken that faith.\n\n\n\tOur whole method of preaching Krsna consciousness is based on awakening faith. Lord Nityananda, the original spiritual master, by His method of distributing Krsna consciousness awakened faith in the hearts of those who previously had no faith. He awakened faith in Jagai and Madhai, he awakened faith in Lord Caitanya to Jagai and Madhai because His method itself was to awaken that faith, because the method was so purely motivated, no tinge of karma and jnana, no personal interest.\n\n\n\tLord Nityananda and Haridasa Thakura are like two patrolmen who go out on Ajna Tahal. They wander about the streets begging everybody, \u201cPlease chant Krsna\u2019s names, serve Krsna, make Krsna\u2019s teachings your life.\u201d Wherever they go, this was their message. Lord Caitanya sent them out on sankirtana every day. When He sent them out He said, \u201cEvery day you come back from sankirtana and give me your results.\u201d Lord Caitanya was an original sankirtana leader sending Nityananda and Haridasa out on sankirtana every day and said, \u201cTell me who chanted Krsna\u2019s name today.\u201d Haridasa Thakura and Nityananda would go out with His order on their heads begging others to please chant Krsna\u2019s name.\n\n\n\tThey had no other motive except to serve the order of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Therefore their method of distribution was so pure that it awakened faith. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says in the Vaisnava-siddhanta-mala that this type of patrolling has to be performed. One shouldn\u2019t go out asking for milk and rice. This will not awaken faith. Nityananda awakened faith because the only result He wanted to offer to Lord Caitanya were those who were chanting Krsna\u2019s names.\n\n\n\tHe would cry, sometimes He would fall on the ground with tears on His eyes, \u201cPlease chant Krsna\u2019s name.\u201d Just seeing that awakened faith. Such is the power of pure Vaisnavas. Not only do they speak but their words impregnated them in such a way that it awakened faith.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada said in that lecture, \u201cI have created your faith.\u201d Of course, the potential is already there within the heart.\n\n\n\tnitya-siddha krsna-prema \u2018sadhya' kabhu naya\n\tsravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya (CC Madhya 22.107)\n\n\n\tPure love for Krsna is eternally situated within the heart of every living being. It doesn\u2019t come from any other source. sravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya. When one hears about Krsna from the right source, it\u2019s brought out. Prabhupada says, \u201cThe catalyst has to be there to bring it out. Just like fire is in the wood, it\u2019s lying dormant, but unless you touch it with the catalyst, you can\u2019t bring it out. Pure love is situated in the heart but it needs a catalyst to bring it out.\u201d Prabhupada said in this lecture, \u201cI have given you this faith.\u201d His words were potent with prema-bhakti. His words were potent with love for Krsna. Coming in contact with his words and seeing his example was such a totally consistent experience that you couldn\u2019t help but have faith.\n\n\n\tOf course, one had to have adhikara as well. But even if one didn\u2019t have adhikara, Prabhupada still had that potency to awaken faith in those who didn\u2019t even know \u2026 (a short pause in the recording). Therefore he spoke only about devotional service. Of course, you sometimes hear in his conversations that Prabhupada would talk about many other topics, but he always brought it to the siddhanta and he was always prepared to speak uncompromisingly to anyone about siddhanta. Prabhupada wouldn\u2019t mince words. He would speak boldly.\n\n\n\tBhaktivinoda Thakura gives this example that shraddha, faith, when it\u2019s awakened within the heart, is like the birth of a new-born baby-girl. When a girl takes her birth, the mother has to be very careful to protect her. She protects her from heat and cold, hunger and thirst and from dangerous creatures. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, \u201cJust as mother protects a new-born girl, she also gives nourishment, pusti. Simultaneously along with protecting, the mother continues to nourish the child to give strength to fight off these bad elements themselves. In this same way, sraddha, faith in pure devotional service, is established within the heart.\u201d\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada says in Caitanya Caritamrita, \u201cThere are many seeds that can be planted within the heart.\u201d For instance, there\u2019s the karma-bija, the jnana-bija and so many other bijas. But in Sri Caitanya\u2019s instructions to Srila Rupa Goswami He speaks about bhakti-lata-bija. Bhakti-lata-bija is the seed of pure devotional service. When that seed of pure devotional service is planted and awakened, then nourishment has to continue. What does nourishment mean? It means that one has to continue hearing about pure devotional service. And then just as a mother protects her child from heat and cold, hunger and thirst, the guardians of devotional service are supposed to protect our hearts from the influence of karma and jnana.\n\n\n\tTherefore Prabhupada often quoted the verse,\n\n\n\tbhukti-mukti-sprha yavat pisaci hrdi vartate\n\n\n\tBhukti is the desire for material enjoyment, and mukti is the desire for liberation. They are like two witches that haunt one like a ghost. As long as these two witches are there in the heart haunting one, one will never taste the bliss of bhakti. Bhakti will always remain a mystery.\n\n\n\tWe may hear so much about pure bhakti, about the bliss of devotional service. Rupa Goswami makes the comparison that one drop of bhakti can inundate the whole universe. It makes the pleasure derived from jnana to be so insignificant. Srila Prabhupada would quote the verse by Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati,\n\n\n\tkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate\n\t(Sri Caitanya-candramrta 5, Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati Thakura)\n\n\n\tOne who has, just once, caught a merciful glance of Lord Caitanya then kaivalyam narakayate, liberation for him becomes like hell. tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate, the pleasure of the heavenly planets becomes like a phantasmagoria and the venomous serpents of the senses become like serpents with broken fangs. They no longer have any poisonous effect. Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati gives this example also. He says, \u201cSenses are like venomous serpents. A venomous serpent always looks for an object to strike. Senses are also looking for an object to strike. But if anyone gets a merciful glance of Lord Caitanya, then the venomous serpents of the senses become like serpents with broken fangs.\u201d They no longer have a poisonous effect. And then he says, \u201cvisvam purna-sukhayate \u2013 the whole universe becomes joyful by that merciful glance. And the positions of Brahma and Indra \u2013 they become like insignificant insects.\u201d\n\n\n\tThat\u2019s one merciful glance of Lord Caitanya. That merciful glance of Lord Caitanya is compared to the awakening of faith in pure bhakti. But that bliss of pure devotional service will always remain a mystery as long as the desires for bhukti and mukti are within the heart. Therefore, one has to be very careful, as Lord Caitanya instructed, to discriminate between the weeds and the devotional creeper. \u201cWhat is the weed that will choke my devotional plant? How do we get rid of those weeds?\u201d That is the science of devotional service, how to get rid of those weeds. So many instructions are given in the Bhagavatam.\n\n\n\tWhen we were having the Bhagavatam class at the Baltic festival last week, we were reading the verses told by Kapiladeva to Devahuti. Lord Kapiladeva told Devahuti,\n\n\n\tta ete sadhavah sadhvi\n\tsarva-sanga-vivarjitah\n\tsangas tesv atha te prarthyah\n\tsanga-dosa-hara hi te (SB 3.25.24)\n\n\n\t\u201cMy mother, o virtuous lady, you have to seek the attachment of those who are always talking about Krsna, who are always talking about pure devotional service. Seek out for their association and become attached to hearing from them. It will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachment.\u201d\n\n\n\tThis is the science of devotional service. This is the method of cleaning the heart. We can\u2019t eradicate these attachments ourselves. We don\u2019t have the strength to fight maya. Just like, when I had my first test from maya and said, \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d I was foolishly thinking that I was the doer and therefore said, \u201cI can\u2019t do it\u201d. But it did not depend upon me. I can never do it alone. I am always dependent on the mercy of Vaisnavas. \u201d\n\n\n\tThat\u2019s what Lord Kapiladeva is saying also. Lord Kapiladeva says, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. But if you depend on the mercy of Vaisnavas, you can do it because they give you the extra strength to overcome your attachments. All you have to do is to become attached to hearing from them because they are speaking about pure devotional service.\u201d Become attached to hearing about pure devotional service even though, \u201cI know I know. It\u2019s so far away. I can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s too much.\u201d But an honest and sincere person will realize, \u201cThese are things I don\u2019t want. I don\u2019t want these attachments. They are dragging me down. I can\u2019t get rid of them myself.\u201d The Bhagavatam says, \u201cOk. Don\u2019t get rid of your attachments. Feed them.\u201d How do you feed your attachments? Become attached to Vaisnavas. Lord Kapiladeva says, \u201cEvery learned person knows that attachment to the material things is the cause of bondage for the living entity but when the same attachment is applied to a self-realized devotee, moksa-dvaram apavrtam, the gates to liberation are open. Don\u2019t give up attachment.\n\n\n\tWe\u2019ve been reading Queen Kunti\u2019s prayers. Queen Kunti says to Krsna, \u201cYou are the property of the materially-impoverished.\u201d Prabhupada says, \u201cThe living entity is finished as soon as he has nothing to possess. Everyone has to possess something. He is finished if he has nothing to possess.\u201d It\u2019s the symptom of life to possess something. The first words Prabhupada says right there in the commentary, \u201cThe living entity is finished as soon as he has nothing to possess.\u201d Everybody who hears this says, \u201cWow! Prabhupada knows my heart. He knows that I have to possess something.\u201d Of course, Prabhupada goes on to explain what the most valuable possession is. The most valuable possession is when one possesses Krsna within the core of his heart.\n\n\n\tSo, Prabhupada says, \u201cDon\u2019t give up your attachments. Change your attachments. Become attached to hearing from Vaisnavas.\u201d Lord Kapiladeva says the same thing in the Bhagavatam, \u201cIf you become attached to Vaisnavas, this will counteract the pernicious effects of material attachment.\u201d It\u2019s not that, \u201cI\u2019ll give it up by myself.\u201d We can\u2019t give it up ourselves. That\u2019s what the impersonalists try to do. Due to intense frustration, impersonalists say \u201cI give it up.\u201d They try to renounce everything. But Lord Brahma says that you can\u2019t become fully liberated by such a method of giving up. He says \u201cYou\u2019ll fall down from that position of imagined superiority because you never become attached to Krsna\u2019s lotus feet.\u201d\n\n\n\tSo the symptom of life is to be attached. The Vaisnavas are so kind that they are giving us what we should be attached to even before we realize it, even before we have the desire to want it. They are giving it even before we\u2019ve asked for it. Prabhupada says, \u201cThat\u2019s the method of distribution.\u201d Lord Caitanya says, \u201cTake!\u201d Previously when Krsna came, He said, \u201cAbandon all varieties of religions and surrender unto Me.\u201d When Krsna came, He said, \u201cFirst surrender and then I\u2019ll deliver you from sinful reactions.\u201d\n\n\n\tBut when Lord Caitanya came, He said, \u201cTake!\u201d All conditions removed. \u201cTake this Holy Name of the Lord. Take this pure devotional service. Take it, make it your life. Take the Holy name but chant it sincerely. Serve the holy name. The Holy name will eradicate, will cleanse all the desires within your heart.\u201d Without any previous qualification someone came and said, \u201cTake!\u201d Just like my Godbrother Kesava who gave me that tape, \u201cTake.\u201d I took it. No questions asked. I didn\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d I was greedy. I took it. I listened to it every day.\n\n\n\tThis is Lord Caitanya\u2019s method of helping us to overcome our attachments. If we don\u2019t take, we won\u2019t advance. There\u2019s plenty to take but we have to take it. The Bhagavatam says,\n\n\n\tsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah\n\tpunya-sravana-kirtanah\n\thrdy antah stho hy abhadrani\n\tvidhunoti suhrt satam (SB 1.2.17)\n\n\n\t\u201cSri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul in the heart of all living entities, cleanses the desire for material enjoyment from the heart of that person who developed the urge to take.\u201d\n\n\n\tThat\u2019s what Bhagavatam says. Just develop the urge to take. Don\u2019t ask, \"Why should I take it?\" Don\u2019t fight. Just take it. What happens then? The more we take, the more we begin to see that pure devotional service and we see the other things that start to come to the surface of our hearts. The Bhagavatam says, \u201cThat\u2019s OK. Just keep on taking.\u201d But we think, \u201cI don\u2019t know. These things that are coming up in my heart they are consuming me. How can I think about taking? I might lose. If I keep on taking and taking, Krsna in my heart might take too. He might take something away that I didn\u2019t give Him. I\u2019m going to protect this. Because if I keep hearing about pure devotional service, when I might not be looking, Krsna might take something away. So, I have to keep watching. Krsna, I\u2019m holding on to it so You won\u2019t take it. But if I keep on hearing how You are going to take my attachments away from me, that\u2019s too disturbing. Maybe I should hear from people who are going to tell me I can keep them. Let me hear from those who talk about karma and jnana. I\u2019m not ready for pure bhakti yet. Let me hear about these other things that let me feel more comfortable about my attachments.\u201d\n\n\n\tIf one is not careful, he abandons hearing about pure devotional service or he could lose his taste.\n\n\n\tbhogaisvarya-prasaktanam\n\ttayapahrta-cetasam\n\tvyavasayatmika buddhih\n\tsamadhau na vidhiyate (Bg 2.44)\n\n\n\t\u201cIn the minds of those who are too much attached to material opulence and sense enjoyment and who are bewildered by such things, there\u2019s no resolute determination to take to pure bhakti.\u201d\n\n\n\tKrsna is warning us that if we refuse to keep on taking the medicine of pure devotional service, the urge to go on hearing these messages will gradually wane within the heart. One can lose taste or one can begin to think that there are many other tastes that are nicer right now. \u201cI\u2019ll come back to this other taste some other time.\u201d\n\n\n\tBut Narada Muni was already way ahead of you. When he told Vyasadeva to compile the Bhagavatam he already knew that some people would think like this. Therefore, in order to convince Vyasa to compile the Bhagavatam, he told him, \u201cThose who forsake their material occupational duties in order to take pure devotional service may fall down at an immature stage, but there\u2019s no danger of being unsuccessful. On the other hand, even though a non-devotee is perfectly engaged in his occupational duties, he doesn\u2019t gain anything.\u201d He says, \u201cMy dear Vyasa, even though a devotee of Lord Krsna sometimes falls down somehow or other he cannot become a fruitive worker again because anyone who once has had the taste of Krsna\u2019s lotus feet will never be able to forget that ecstasy.\u201d\n\n\n\tWe may try. We may try very hard. We may do so many things to try to forget, but it won\u2019t last permanently. Sooner or later it will bring us back to Krsna\u2019s lotus feet. But of course, a foolish person should never try to lose the shelter of Krsna\u2019s lotus feet. If one tries to forget the shelter of Krsna\u2019s lotus feet and wanders about into all other activities, it will only lead to suffering. That\u2019s all. An intelligent person should avoid these things.\n\n\n\tTherefore, Prabhupada would oftentimes quote the verse from Caitanya Caritamrita, \u201cMy devotee engages in devotional service but at the same time he wants to taste something else too. Why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him take shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget these things.\u201d Therefore, Krsna fulfills the desires of His devotees in such a way that a devotee will come back and never ask for it again. This is not very intelligent.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada says in the Sixth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam that an intelligent person learns from hearing. The less intelligent person hears, but thinks, \u201cI\u2019ll still do it.\u201d He could have avoided the suffering but he thinks, \u201cI\u2019ll still do it.\u201d The least intelligent person has heard, he is punished, he suffers but he will still do it again. Therefore, one should become intelligent. An intelligent person will simply go on hearing even though his heart is filled with desires and attachments. \u201cJust go on hearing the glories of pure devotional service. It will give you the strength to overcome all of the attachment that are there within your heart. Don\u2019t lose hope and don\u2019t give it up.\u201d It will act.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada says just like fire burns. A child may not know that the fire burns but when the child touches the fire, it burns. The fire doesn\u2019t think, \u201cThis is a child. I won\u2019t burn him.\u201d No, it will act. In the same way, hearing the glories of pure devotional service will act.\n\n\n\tI want to add just by reading one verse. It\u2019s the verse from the Bhagavatam I quoted the other day where Srila Prabhupada speaks about this point in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s own unique way. Prabhupada has a way with words. It\u2019s his trademark.\n\n\n\tIt\u2019s the verse from the Fifth Canto of the Bhagavatam. The verse speaks about pure devotees and what happens in an assembly of pure devotees. It\u2019s the verse from the Fifth Canto, Chapter 12, Text 13. Who are the pure devotees mentioned here?\n\n\n\tyatrottamasloka-gunanuvadah\n\tprastuyate gramya-katha-vighatah\n\tnisevyamano 'nudinam mumuksor\n\tmatim satim yacchati vasudeve\n\n\n\t\u201cWho are the pure devotees mentioned here? In an assembly of pure devotees, there is no question of discussing material subjects like politics and sociology. In an assembly of pure devotees, there is discussion only of the qualities, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is praised and worshiped with full attention. In the association of pure devotees, by constantly hearing such topics respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of V\u0101sudeva.\u201d\n\n\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\n\n\n\tThe symptoms of pure devotees are described in this verse. The pure devotee is never interested in material topics. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has strictly prohibited His devotees to talk about worldly matters. Gramya-varta na kahibe: one should not indulge in talking unnecessarily about news of the material world. One should not waste time in this way. This is a very important feature in the life of a devotee. A devotee has no other ambition than to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement was started to engage people twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord and in His glorification. The students in this institution engage in the cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from five in the morning to ten at night. They actually have no opportunity to waste their time unnecessarily by discussing politics, sociology and current events. This will go their own way. A devotee is concerned only with serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a positively and seriously.\n\n\n\tPURPORT by Niranjana Swami:\n\n\n\tPrabhupada says in many places (I can show you so many places) in the Bhagavatam that our Krsna consciousness movement is established for this purpose. It was established for Hari-katha. Devotees understand the importance of regularly hearing Hari-katha, the glories of pure devotional service. When they actually make it their daily nourishment, they will see that this is the method of dealing with all of those attachments. \u201cJust go on hearing. Don\u2019t give it up. Don\u2019t think there are some other topics that are more important.\u201d These are the most important topics for those who are aspiring for Krsna\u2019s lotus feet. Of course, if we are not aspiring for Krsna\u2019s lotus feet, we\u2019ll find many other topics to hear about. But those who are aspiring for Krsna\u2019s lotus feet will see that these topics will gradually bring us to Krsna\u2019s lotus feet.\n\n\n\tTherefore, Lord Brahma says anyone who has faith in hearing these topics or, as Lord Krsna says to Uddhava, \u201cHaving awakened faith in hearing narrations of Krsna, being disgusted with material life, knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering but still not able to give it up this is My devotee should simply remain happy and continue serving Me with faith. Because My devotee knows that all sense gratification leads to suffering because he has awakened faith in hearing these narrations - he will sincerely repent in his heart for his inability to give it up.\u201d\n\n\n\tThat\u2019s the symptom of a devotee \u2013 he sincerely repents within his heart for his inability to give it up. He prays to Krsna, \u201cPlease help me to eradicate these attachments.\u201d He doesn\u2019t justify them in his heart. \u201cOh, no, actually these things are more important.\u201d He knows, \u201cI have to give these things up. I can\u2019t do it alone. I\u2019m completely dependent on Krsna\u2019s mercy and completely dependent on the mercy of Vaisnavas to clean my heart who are very mercifully giving me the Holy name and who are watering the Holy name by discussing the glories of the Holy name.\u201d\n\n\n\tIn Caitanya Caritamrita it is stated that one should learn the truth and the beauty of the Holy name by hearing the revealed scriptures from the mouths of Vaisnavas. There\u2019s no other way to taste the sweetness of Krsna\u2019s Holy name. Prabhupada is doing this for us in his beautiful, beautiful commentaries to Srimad Bhagavatam. His lectures are like nectar. Have all of you read this book? Is there anyone who hasn\u2019t read this book? Nectar! Take it. Hare Krsna. Thank you very much.\n\n","nid":"11307"},{

One must follow strictly the instruction of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu given in the \u015aik\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6daka (3):\n\n\n\tt\u1e5b\u1e47ad api su-nacena taror iva sahi\u1e63\u1e47una\n\tamanina mana-dena kirtaniya\u1e25 sada hari\u1e25\n\n\n\t[Cc. Adi 17.31]\n\n\n\t\"One should chant the Holy Name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the Holy Name of the Lord constantly.\" One who follows this direction, being freed from the ten kinds of offenses, becomes successful in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and ultimately reaches the platform of loving service to the Personality of Godhead.\n\n\n\tOne must come to the understanding that the Holy Name of the Lord and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself are identical. One cannot reach this conclusion unless one is offenseless in chanting the Holy Name. By our material calculation we see a difference between the name and the substance, but in the spiritual world the Absolute is always absolute: the name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Absolute are all as good as the Absolute Himself. Thus one is understood to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he considers himself an eternal servant of the Holy Name and in this spirit distributes the Holy Name to the world. One who chants in that spirit, without offenses, is certainly elevated to the platform of understanding that the Holy Name and the Personality of Godhead are identical. To associate with the Holy Name and chant the Holy Name is to associate with the Personality of Godhead directly. In the Bhakti-rasam\u1e5bta-sindhu it is clearly said, sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25. The Holy Name becomes manifest when one engages in the service of the Holy Name. This service in a submissive attitude begins with one's tongue. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau: One must engage his tongue in the service of the Holy Name. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is based on this principle. We try to engage all the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement in the service of the Holy Name. Since the Holy Name and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are nondifferent, the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement not only chant the Holy Name of the Lord offenselessly, but also do not allow their tongues to eat anything that is not first offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord declares:\n\n\n\tpatram pu\u1e63pam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati\n\ttad aham bhakty-upah\u1e5btam asnami prayatatmana\u1e25\n\n\n\t\"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.\" (Bg. 9.26) Therefore the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has many temples all over the world, and in each and every temple the Lord is offered these foods. On the basis of His demands, the devotees chant the Holy Name of the Lord offenselessly and never eat anything that is not first offered to the Lord. The functions of the tongue in devotional service are to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra and eat pras\u0101dam that is offered to the Lord.\n\n\n\tHH Niranjana Swami Maharaja:\n\n\n\tom ajnana-timirandhasya\n\tjnananjana-salakaya\n\tcaksur unmilitam yena\n\ttasmai sri-gurave namah\n\n\n\tmukam karoti vachalam\n\tpangum langhayate girim\n\tyat-kripa tam aham vande\n\tshri-gurum dina-taranam\n\n\n\tnama om visnu-padaya krsna-presthaya bhu-tale\n\tsrimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine\n\tnamas te sarasvate deve gaura-vani-pracarine\n\tnirvisesa -sunyavadi-pascatya-desa-tarine\n\n\n\tjaya sri-krishna-chaitanya prabhu nityananda\n\tsri-adwaita gadadhara shrivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrinda\n\n\n\tHare Krsna Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\n\tK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Hare Hare\n\tHare R\u0101ma Hare R\u0101ma\n\tR\u0101ma R\u0101ma Hare Hare\n\n\n\tBefore I begin, I\u2019d like to say that it is a great honor for me to be given this opportunity to render some service to all the assembled Vaishnavas today. I pray, that you\u2019ll give me your blessings so that I may say something relevant especially since I have been asked to speak about the Holy Name, since today is the last day of our kirtan mela. The devotees have assembled here to dive deeply into the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord. I need your blessings to say something relevant to such a deep topic. Therefore, I offer my obeisances to all my godbrothers\n\n\n\tvancha-kalpatarubhyash cha\n\tkripa-sindhubhya eva cha\n\tpatitanam pavanebhyo\n\tvaishnavebhyo namo namaha\n\n\n\twho have assembled here. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\tIn this verse, importance is stressed about chanting the Holy Name so that one can achieve the ultimate goal of this chanting. I wanted to read something also in connection to this. It is short but very relevant to this verse. In the words of our param guru Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, in answer to the question, \u2018how should we chant the Lord\u2019s Holy Names\u2019. I find this very relevant to myself and therefore I\u2019ve been sharing it with many devotees and I would like to read it first and then in some way try to be able to explain the meaning behind it.\n\n\n\t(Maharaja begins reading)\n\t\u201cPure devotees do not chant the Lords Names to counteract sinful reactions, accumulate piety, attain heavenly pleasures, to mitigate famine, devastating epidemics, social unrest, disease, civil strife or to obtain wealth or an earthly kingdom. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to ask Him to fulfill our wishes is to treat Him as our servant. This is an offense. Therefore calling the Lords Names for any reason other than to attain His devotional service is useless. Jesus Christ told us not to take the Lords name in vain. However this does not mean that we do not need to always chant the Lords Names, while sleeping, awake, eating or enjoying happiness, to chant the Lords Names, begging for His service is not a useless activity, it is our only duty. But to make a show of chanting for some other purpose in other words to fulfill our own desire is useless. We should not take to the chanting of the Lords Names uselessly. We should not chant to attain religiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation instead we should always chant to attain the Lords service.\u201d\n\t(Maharaja ends reading)\n\n\n\tI thought this was very relevant. Many times when we are sitting engaged in kirtan, engaged in japa, we try to hold on to something that we should be praying for and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur here explains, that unless one is actually chanting for service, any other purpose, any other purpose and he gives a long list, not for social unrest, not for epidemics, not for material prosperity, any chanting to relieve distress, whether individually or collectively is materially motivated. And therefore, he uses a strong word, he says it\u2019s useless which we may question, because sometimes we hear so many verses which explain that even once chanting the Holy Names of the Lord will eradicate all kinds of sinful reactions for millions of births. And here somebody may be chanting, collectively with a large group, for a particular purpose, yet he defines it as useless chanting. It makes me think of a verse in the Srimad Bhagavatam, in the 3rd Canto, spoken by Devahuti. She says that anyone whose work does not lead to religious life and any one whose religious, ritualistic performances do not elevate one to renunciation and anyone who is situated in renunciation that doesn\u2019t lead to devotional service to the Supreme Lord, is to be considered to be a dead body, although breathing.\n\n\n\tHere, in this verse, emphasis is given on the ultimate goal. Unless the ultimate goal is reached, which is the essence of today\u2019s verse, if we want to actually achieve the ultimate goal of chanting, we have to become free from offenses. And unless the ultimate goal is achieved, which is devotional service to the Supreme Lord, any other achievement is useless. Because the only full achievement of chanting the Holy Name of the Lord, is to achieve love for the Supreme Lord. Love which is freed from all material desires.\n\n\n\tanyabhilasita-sunyam\n\tjnana-karmady-anavrtam\n\n\n\tas Srila Rupa Goswami explains, that such devotional service should be freed from the influence of karma and jnana. And Srila Rupa Goswami also states that\n\n\n\tbhukti-mukti-sp\u1e5bha yavat\n\tpisaci h\u1e5bdi vartate\n\n\n\tHe says as long as the desire for bhukti, the desire for material enjoyment, mukti, the desire for relief from suffering, liberation, as long as these two desires that are within the heart, which are considered to be like two witches, which haunt one like a ghost, then one will never be able to taste the bliss of devotional service to the Supreme Lord. And therefore it is stated in Caitanya Caritamrita that the goal of chanting is to achieve this love. And Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur here also states that to approach the Lord for something for ourselves, he says it\u2019s an offense. We should not ask anything for ourselves. He says, therefore all these other purposes for which one chants are considered to be useless, unless we actually, purposely, with intent sit and intensely very much pray for service to the Lord. That service, that opportunity to engage in devotional service, is bestowed by the mercy of the Lord and also bestowed by the mercy of the devotee of the Lord. Therefore, in examining these statements, both here in this commentary by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta and here in Srila Prabhupadas commentary, he gives the siddha pranali, which is, that if one wants to be successful in chanting, he quotes the verse that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur emphasizes is the siddha pranali for Gaudiya Vaishnavas which is\n\n\n\tt\u1e5b\u1e47ad api su-nacena taror iva sahi\u1e63\u1e47una\n\tamanina mana-dena kirtaniya\u1e25 sada hari\u1e25\n\n\n\tand Lord Caitanya Himself, has stated when explaining this verse. He says that a devotee who is engaged in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord, he does not retaliate, even if he is rebuked or chastised. He never retaliates or says anything to anyone else about such activity. He says, and he gives an example that, even if a tree is cut, the tree will not complain and even if the tree is drying up, it will not ask anyone for water. And He says that such forbearance must be practiced by the devotee. Thus a Vaishnava should engage in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord and he should never ask anyone for anything for himself. If someone offers, He will accept, but if someone doesn\u2019t offer, he is satisfied to accept whatever comes by its own means. But then He says something very very important. He says, this type of devotional service solidly maintains, this type of behavior solidly maintains a devotees devotional service. This type of behavior. He doesn\u2019t ask, he tolerates. So forbearing! There is a verse in the Srimad Bhagavatam,\n\n\n\ttirask\u1e5bta vipralabdha\u1e25\n\tsapta\u1e25 k\u1e63ipta hata api\n\tnasya tat pratikurvanti\n\ttad-bhakta\u1e25 prabhavo 'pi hi\n\n\n\tThis verse is spoken about Parikshit Maharaja. It was spoken by Samika rishi, when he learnt that his son had garlanded a snake around Parikshit Maharajas neck. He was extremely disturbed, because he understood that Parikshit Maharaja, is such a saintly Vaishnava. In his heart he was thinking, if only Parikshit Maharaja would counteract what has happened to him by cursing my son, then that will be proper just punishment for him. But then he realised, wait a minute:\n\n\n\ttirask\u1e5bta vipralabdha\u1e25\n\tsapta\u1e25 k\u1e63ipta hata api\n\n\n\tHow will it be possible? Parikshit Maharaja wouldn\u2019t do that. Because, devotees of the Lord are so forbearing, that even if they are cheated, cursed, neglected, disturbed, insulted or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves. What can I do? Parikshit Maharaja will never counter curse. I can only simply pray to the Lord, that somehow He sees the situation and He understands what needs to be done to correct the situation, because Parikshit Maharaja will never counteract or counter curse my son. Such is the characteristic of a devotee. A devotee is so forbearing. Cheated, cursed, neglected, insulted, insulted, disturbed or even killed!\u00a0 But will never avenge himself. Why? Why? Because he is so forbearing, he is so tolerant! This type of devotional service, this type of mood in the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord as Lord Caitanya Himself states, this behavior solidly maintains devotional service for the devotee. It gives him the means by which he can actually be situated in devotional service, because he is so tolerant that the Lord cannot neglect! Others may neglect, but the Lord will not neglect.\u00a0 How can the Lord neglect such a devotee? He cannot neglect. He cannot turn away. Look what happened to Ambarish Maharaja?\n\n\n\tWhen Ambarish Maharaja was cursed, he didn\u2019t even pray to the Lord for protection but the Lord protected him. And when Durvasa Muni came to the Lord, first he went to Lord Brahma, he went to Lord Shiva, then he went to Lord Vishnu. Of course Brahma and Shiva they were not able to provide him relief, because that\u2019s what he wanted, he wanted relief.\u00a0 Please relieve me.\u00a0 Brahma says I can\u2019t, Lord Shiva says I can\u2019t and then he came to Lord Vishnu, he says, \u201cPlease look at me I am suffering\u201d.\u00a0 Then Lord Vishnu says, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t do anything to help you\u201d.\n\n\n\tAnd Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur in his commentaries to these verses, he explains the mood the Lord has in His conversation with Durvasa Muni.\u00a0 When Durvasa Muni, he approaches the Lord for protection and he says, \u201cPlease can you mitigate my distress? You have invoked this chakra, certainly you can remove it\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 The Lord says, \u201cI am sorry, I am not independent. I am completely under the control of my devotee. The devotee is always in My heart and I am always in the heart of My devotee. The devotee doesn\u2019t think of anyone but Me and I don\u2019t think of anyone but him\u201d.\u00a0 And then what does Durvasa Muni say? He says: \u201cCertainly, when You see somebody suffering and they are coming to You for protection, certainly you must be inclined to feel for his suffering\u201d.\u00a0 He\u2019s begging, \u201cPlease have a heart and the Lord says, \u201cSorry! Actually I can\u2019t even think of your suffering.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have a heart and I can\u2019t even think of your suffering\u201d. Durvasa Muni says, \u201cHow is it possible?\u201d And then the Lord explains, He says: \u201cMy devotee is so dear to Me. He is my devotee because He always takes me into the core of his heart and he is always praying to Me please let me engage in Your service. He doesn\u2019t want anything else. He\u2019s always thinking how he can serve Me. So therefore I approach My devotee and I say, please let Me give you something. But My devotee says, \u2018I don\u2019t want anything\u201d. And the Lord says, \u201cI want to give you something, anything\u201d.\n\n\n\tJust like He told Kholaveca Sridhar, he was always chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. People would complain. He said, \u201cKholaveca, I\u2019ll make you a king.\u00a0 I\u2019ll give you a kingdom\u201d. Kholaveca says: \u201cNo!\u00a0 You simply be my Lord and master and let me be Your servant birth after birth\u201d. So the Lord explains, He says, \u201cMy devotee only asks for one thing, let me serve You! So therefore, how can I give him anything, he doesn\u2019t want? But still I must give him something. I must give him something which is valuable. Something which he\u2019ll appreciate or value. Something that will mean something for him. He doesn\u2019t want wealth. He doesn\u2019t want follower. He doesn\u2019t want beautiful women. He doesn\u2019t want anything from me. But let me give him something that he\u2019ll accept. So what do I give him.\u00a0 I give him My heart. My devotee has my heart. And you are asking me have a heart! And I am saying, I am sorry. I don\u2019t have one. I can\u2019t even think. My devotee has My mind, he has My heart. You want My heart, You have to go to him\u201d.\n\n\n\tThe Lord is so much inclined, He can\u2019t neglect a devotee who is always fully depending upon Him. And therefore, when a devotee chants the Holy Name of the Lord in this mentality. It nourishes, it sustains, solidly maintains a devotees devotional service, so much so, that the Lord gives him the greatest benediction. Not only gives His heart, gives Himself, but He gives His devotee His devotional service, which is the means for perfection.\n\n\n\tIf one sits and meditates and chants the Holy Names of the Lord, yes, we may want to go back home back to godhead, we want to actually take shelter in the spiritual world, but actually that place can be obtained only by those who think first and foremost, service. It\u2019s not achieved by anything else. Only if one actually has this attitude, this complete helpless dependence, \u2018Oh Lord please engage me in Your service\u2019.\u00a0 Therefore we must understand that this devotional service to enter into the spiritual world can only be achieved when one actually gets the mercy of the Lord's devotee.\u00a0 And therefore, it is stated by Srila Narattoma Das Thakur, he says that \u201cWhen will Lord Nityananda's mercy be fully manifest to me, so that material desires will become so completely insignificant, when will that time come?\u201d And he says, \u201cWhen my mind is completely purified, completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires, then and only then, will I be able to understand Sri Vrindavan dham and the conjugal love of Sri Radha and Krishna and only then will my spiritual life be successful\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\n\tHe explains that, \u201cYes, I have to get the mercy of the greatest servant of Lord Caitanya who is Lord Nityananda. It is Lord Nityananda who actually cleanses the heart. Gives one spiritual strength. Gives one the strength to actually become free from all these material obstacles, the desire for wealth, the desire for relief from suffering, the desire for material enjoyment\u201d. In the Srimad Bhagavatam it is stated by Narada Muni, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to those devotees who have no material possessions and who are fully satisfied in possessing only devotional service to the Supreme Lord.\u00a0 Indeed the Lord relishes the activities of such devotees. Those who are puffed up by respectable parentage, by great opulence, by bodily beauty, they\u2019re generally proud of possessing such things. And even if they offer the Lord worship, he says the Lord is not inclined to accept it. Why? Because they deride the devotee of the Lord. When they see the devotee, who is so fully dependent upon the mercy of the Lord, they deride the devotee. Just like Kholaveca Sridhar, the worshipers of goddess Chandi, they saw how Kholaveca Sridhar was so absorbed in chanting, but they would deride him. \u2018Why don\u2019t you worship goddess Chandi? Look at us we are wealthy, and look at you, you live in a hut, your roof, there are so many holes in it. You are crying at night, all night long with hunger pains, disturbing all your neighbors. Why don\u2019t you take shelter?\u2019\u00a0 But what was Kholaveca Sridhar\u2019s mood?\u00a0 His mood was completely calling out the Names of the Lord. Only for one purpose, only for one purpose, to glorify the Lord, to be engaged in the service of the Lord. Such devotional service, such behavior, solidly maintains a devotees devotional service.\n\n\n\tLord Nityananda is very merciful and therefore as we understand, if we want to enter into the dancing party of Radha and Krsna we have to catch hold of the feet of Lord Nityananda and only then will we be qualified to enter into the spiritual world.\u00a0 It is Lord Nityananda who showed by His example, how to take the order of the Supreme Lord and to tolerate all kinds of inconveniences. It was Lord Nityananda who took the order of Lord Caitanya, who told Him go out every day into the streets, and then induce others to chant Krsna's names, to tell others about Krsna, make Krsna your life and then you come back in the evening and you tell me how many people have been chanting?\n\n\n\tWhat is Lord Nityananda begging for? He was begging to give others the opportunity to understand what is the real meaning of the Holy Name of the Lord and therefore His method of distribution was so glorious, so glorious that by His method of distribution He will awaken faith in others. This is what He was looking for; He was not looking for anything else.\n\n\n\tSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakur says that when patrolman Haridas Thakur and Lord Nityananda went into the streets, They did not go out for any selfish purpose, begging for milk and rice. They simply went out for one reason, carrying the order of the Lord on their heads and begging everyone, even in the face of all kinds of adversities. Being struck in the head with a pot by Madhai, still He was so merciful. So merciful.\n\n\n\tHe was thinking that \u201cYes, if I can make these two personalities understand Lord Caitanya, then I will be recognized as Lord Caitanyas servant\u201d. So it is Lord Nityananda, and the servant of Lord Nityananda who gives us the opportunity to engage in service and not only in chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, but to cleanse the heart, to purify the heart from all material anxieties and desires, so that one can be qualified to enter into Sri Vrindavan Dham. Then we\u2019ll be able to enter into the dancing party of Radha and Krishna.\u00a0 Then we\u2019ll actually be able to approach Radha and Krishna by catching tightly, firmly holding the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda. This way we understand that we have gathered here to chant, collectively, we are chanting, praying for the opportunity to serve. That is our shelter! That is our means for perfection. That is our means for actually pleasing the Lord and becoming qualified to enter into the spiritual world and to enter that transcendental abode and thereby become qualified.\n\n\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta actually explains in the harmonist magazine, he explains something very important. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur says that when Lord Nityananda especially favors a devotee and when He deems His devotee fit for rendering service to Srimati Radhika, He offers that devotee for Her service. Srimati Radharani is the Guru of the inner circle and Lord Nityananda, He is the Guru for the masses. It is Lord Nityananda who actually goes out to the masses and by His method of distribution awakens faith in devotional service, pure devotional service. Not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord for relief of distress, not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord to become free from epidemics, not by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord for elevation to the heavenly planets. By chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, His meditation was only one thing only, His meditation was service to Lord Caitanya. He did not even go out and distribute until He received the order from Lord Caitanya although He traveled on pilgrimage for 20 years, He waited until He came here, to the house of Nandan Acharya and then when He came here and received the order, then He took it up. It is the order!\u00a0 That is our method of service to the Holy Name. And Srila Prabhupada explains that in today\u2019s purport. Very important and I\u2019ll end with this because I see a sign here that says very important, class must end by 8:45am.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada says, \u201cThus one is understood to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he considers himself an eternal servant of the Holy Name and in this spirit distributes the Holy Name to the world. One who chants in that spirit, without offenses\u201d. Without offenses, as we said today, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur said any other purpose for chanting, other than for service is offensive, because it is asking something for myself. So he says, \u201cOne who chants in that spirit, without offenses, is certainly elevated to the platform of understanding that the Holy Name and the Personality of Godhead are identical. To associate with the Holy Name and chant the Holy Name is to associate with the Personality of Godhead directly\u201d.\n\n\n\tkali-kale naam-rupe krishna-avatara\n\tnama haite haya sarva-jagat-nistara\n\n\n\tIt is stated in the Caitanya Caritamrita that in the age of the kali the Supreme Lord appears in the form of His Holy Name. Anyone who associates with the Holy Name is as good as associating with the Lord directly and certainly he is delivered.\n\n\n\tI have to end here. Thank you very much for your kind attention.\n\n\n\tHare Krsna!\n\n\n\tApplause!\n\n","nid":"11244"},{

There are six kinds of activities: (1) giving charity to the devotees, (2) accepting from the devotees whatever they may offer in return, (3) opening one\u2019s mind to the devotees, (4) inquiring from them about the confidential service of the Lord, (5) honoring prasada, or spiritual food, given by the devotees, and (6) feeding the devotees with\u00a0prasada. An experienced devotee explains, and an inexperienced devotee learns from him. This is\u00a0guhyam\u00a0akhyati\u00a0prcchati. When a devotee distributes\u00a0prasada, remnants of food offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in order to maintain our spirit of devotional service we must accept this prasada\u00a0as the Lord's grace received through the pure devotees. We should also invite pure devotees to our home, offer them prasada\u00a0and be prepared to please them in all respects. This is called\u00a0bhunkte\u00a0bhojayate\u00a0caiva.\u201d\n\n\n\tThere is more. We can read more. But for now we\u2019ll stop here and speak a little bit about what we\u2019ve read so far.\n\n\n\tThis is an oft-quoted verse which is very important for those who are practitioners of devotional service. The essence of this verse deals with the nature of loving exchanges. Loving exchanges are, of course, something that everybody would like to have. Especially since love is a very commonly used word, and since it is an often misunderstood word as well. But love describes a very powerful experience that can be transformational; it can change one\u2019s course in life. It\u2019s something that most ordinary people hanker for, although it may not be so readily experienced. Oftentimes, because people are very anxious to experience real love, they may not be able to recognize it when it actually exists. They could also even take an experience they\u2019ve had with someone else and mistake it to be love although it\u2019s not. Love can also be very elusive; it may not be so easy to obtain. And, although sometimes we may think we feel love towards another person or towards society, that feeling may not necessarily be love according to its real definition. It\u2019s even possible that someone may give us real love, he or she may even call it love, but we may not be able to perceive it as such.\n\n\n\tSrila Prabhupada often used this word \u2013 \u201clove.\u201d Of course, whenever he used it, most often he would use it in describing love for God, love for Krsna. When he did so, he would emphasize that this type of loving relationship is something that everybody is really, fundamentally looking for. And he would present love for Krsna in such a way that it became very attractive to those who heard his message, because he introduced a concept of love that was different from what we had been previously accustomed to understand. If we were to analyze the teachings of our founder-acarya, specifically his use of the word \u201clove,\u201d then we would see that his emphasis was love of God. Actually, he established it to be the perfection of life. In other words, to be able to obtain pure, unadulterated, unalloyed love for the Supreme Lord was, in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s vision, prema pumartha mahan \u2013 the highest perfection a living being can possibly achieve in this human form of life. In other words, love of God is not something cheap; it\u2019s not something that can be achieved immediately. It\u2019s life\u2019s goal, and the means to achieve it requires time, great endeavor, severe self-sacrifice, and continual purification of one\u2019s heart before it actually begins to fully manifest itself in one\u2019s heart. Because Srila Prabhupada introduced this use of the word love, we can therefore understand that it\u2019s not a word we can use so cheaply. Therefore, when Srila Rupa Goswami speaks about loving relationships between devotees, as we have read about today in this verse, he is using the same word, \u201clove.\u201d As we have already explained, love is defined\u2026Actually, we haven\u2019t given a definition yet.\n\n\n\tAs we explained, love is not a word that can be thrown around; it should not be used cheaply. Srila Rupa Goswami defines love elsewhere in his teachings. He defines love, in relationship to the Supreme, as those activities aimed exclusively at pleasing Krsna. In other words, the actual intention behind the activity is to satisfy Krsna, and that intention is a manifestation of the desire to selflessly do something for Krsna, without any expectation to receive anything in return. Therefore, Rupa Goswami describes that the subordinate characteristics of love are that it\u2019s free from the desire for fruitive gain and it\u2019s free from the desire for liberation, in other words, the desire to become free from all suffering. So, he gives primary characteristics and subordinate characteristics when he defines love. This is the definition oftentimes used in Vaisnava teachings to help us understand what is real love. It\u2019s free from secondary motives, and it\u2019s an expression of one\u2019s full and complete desire to satisfy the object of one\u2019s love.\n\n\n\tElsewhere, Rupa Goswami also explains that the expression of love means to be able to repose all of one\u2019s affection on one person exclusively, without diverting this affection for even a moment. In other words, it\u2019s not a fleeting experience; he defines it as an experience of affection towards the Supreme that never diminishes. Not only does it never diminish but it always increases. In other words, real love for the Supreme means that the lover, a person who loves the Supreme Lord, will never say in the future, \u201cI thought I loved you\u201d or \u201cI loved you then, but now things have changed.\u201d That\u2019s what Rupa Goswami is saying: Real love means that one\u2019s affection for the beloved will never diminish or be diverted. Or, as Lord Caitanya describes in His Siksastakam prayers \u2013 in which He is speaking in the mood of Radharani, who is the greatest lover for Krsna \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone but Krsna as My Lord. Even if He handles me roughly by His embrace or He makes me broken-hearted by not being present before Me, He is completely free to do anything and everything. I will always love Him.\u201d That is the mood! That is the mood established in the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition. It\u2019s the mood of one who\u2019s actually grasped that elusive experience of love. And therefore, one who truly has love will not say, \u201cWell, I loved you then. But now, after what you\u2019ve done to me, I can\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\tA statement like that tells us what one thought was love wasn\u2019t really love at all. Why is that? Because Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, knows how to reciprocate love better than anyone. In other words, when we actually repose our love in Krsna, the impetus to love Him more comes from Him, and He is consistent in His reciprocation. In the Bhagavad-gita (4.11), Krsna says:\n\n\n\tye\u00a0yatha\u00a0mam\u00a0prapadyante\n\ttams tathaiva bhajamy\u00a0aham\n\tmama\u00a0vartmanuvartante\n\tmanusyah\u00a0partha\u00a0sarvasah\n\n\n\t\u201cAs you surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly.\u201d\n\n\n\tHe is the perfect reciprocator. If you want something material from Him, He can reciprocate in a particular way. But it is said that if Krsna reciprocates with somebody who wants something material from Him, He does it in such a way that person will realize he or she didn\u2019t even want it. Because to receive Krsna personally is always much better than to receive any material boon Krsna can give. That\u2019s His love; He doesn\u2019t want us to be deluded into thinking that some material benediction is perfection. He is such a loving person that He actually wants us to experience love. Therefore, he reciprocates accordingly. Now, of course, for those who have no aspiration for this experience of love, He reciprocates with them according to their desires also, but He doesn\u2019t get personally involved. He sets up the material universe as a medium through which He, with the help of Maya-devi, reciprocates with everyone\u2019s desires for material enjoyment.\n\n\n\tHe says, \u201cAs you surrender unto Me, I reward you accordingly.\u201d If you don\u2019t want Krsna, and you don\u2019t want love for Krsna, and all you want is simply some temporary material gain, then there are other methods of sacrifice one can perform to achieve the fruits of one\u2019s endeavors. But Krsna doesn\u2019t have to get personally involved in those affairs. We can get them, become temporarily happy with them, lose them, and then go after something else. There is no telling how long this process can go on. Krsna won\u2019t intervene. He will just let us keep on going, journeying to higher planets, to lower planets, to middle planets, getting some temporary fruits, losing those temporary fruits, hankering for more temporary fruits, obtaining them, and then losing them. This universe is perfectly equipped to facilitate all of that. But Krsna doesn\u2019t have to personally get involved in any of those things.\n\n\n\tna tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate\n\tna tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drisyate\n\tparasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate\n\tsvabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca\n\t(Svetasvara Upanisad 6.8)\n\n\n\tThis verse explains that Krsna has nothing to do with these things. Of course, He sets everything up and He gives the first push to set things in motion, but then everything else goes on through His multifarious energies. Krsna doesn\u2019t have anything to do with these things, because Krsna is much more attracted to loving exchanges. And there are no loving exchanges with dead material nature, dead matter. So Krsna is not involved with dead matter. And Krsna doesn\u2019t personally get involved with those who are not interested in having any connection with Him (except through the Supersoul, His manifestation within the heart of every living thing).\n\n\n\tTo that degree, through the Supersoul, He is involved. But the two primary functions of the Supersoul are to witness and to give sanction. That\u2019s what the Supersoul does: He\u2019s simply a witness to all the desires that are there within our hearts, and when we are persistent in our desires, then He says, \u201cOkay, you can do it.\u201d Of course, He is ready to do more than that. He is just waiting for us to turn to Him and actually express our desire to make progress towards Him. That is also Krsna\u2019s kindness. He accompanies every living being in every body throughout their solitary journeys in this world.\n\n\n\tBut Krsna wants to give so much more: He wants to give that love experienced by the residents of His own abode \u2013 the world that has no connection with this material world. And therefore, when Krsna reciprocates, when He recognizes that we are making some effort to turn to Him, He does a great deal more to acknowledge us and to encourage us than we have done for Him. Prabhupada used to say, \u201cIf you take one step to Krsna, He takes a hundred steps to you.\u201d In other words, Krsna is the transcendental reciprocator who always reciprocates with any service rendered, even if that service was impure. And He does so in such a way that it increases the impetus for loving Him.\n\n\n\tFor that reason, we can\u2019t blame Krsna if we\u2019ve said to Him, \u201cI loved You then, but I don\u2019t love You now.\u201d Anyone who knows anything about Krsna could never make such a statement. And if I do, it\u2019s obvious I have an inadequate understanding of Krsna, because Krsna exists to give us love, to reciprocate love; that is His greatest pleasure. He derives the greatest pleasure by giving pleasure to those who love Him, even if their love is impure. His derives pleasure from bringing those with impurities closer to Him and purifying them, because He wants nothing more than to give prema-ratana-dhana, the most valuable jewel. Love to Him is described as prema-ratana-dhana, the most valuable jewel in all of creation. It is so valuable that, upon obtaining it, one never wishes to lose it. It is so valuable that, upon being given even a slight glimpse of it\u2019s worth, one wants nothing more than to obtain it.\n\n\n\tOnce, in a conversation between Lord Caitanya and Ramananda Raya, Ramananda Raya responded to the Lord\u2019s question by saying, \u201cPure devotional service, love for God, is such a valuable experience. It cannot be attained even by millions and millions of births of pious activities.\u201d He was making it clear \u2013 it\u2019s not something cheap. One may perform pious activities in millions of births and still that love will be elusive. He says, \u201cPure devotional service can be had only by the intense greed to obtain it. And therefore, whenever one sees it, he should immediately purchase it without delay.\u201d That was Ramananda Raya\u2019s description about how to obtain love for God.\n\n\n\tMillions of births of pious activities won\u2019t bring one this love, but if one gets an opportunity to get a glimpse of it, then one should immediately purchase it without delay. How to get that glimpse? One has to have greed for it in the heart. One has to become greedy for that real love, greedy for that love which is elusive because it can\u2019t be obtained by any other means except by coming in contact with it. When it appears to us through Krsna\u2019s devotees, this is how it becomes appealing to us; this is how we get a glimpse of it. When that love manifests in the heart of a devotee, and the devotee shares that love with others \u2013 which is what Rupa Goswami is talking about here, love between devotees. If one actually wants to grasp this love for Krsna, one has to first learn how to love Krsna\u2019s devotees. Otherwise, we will never be able to approach Krsna; we won\u2019t be able to experience that love.\n\n\n\tRupa Goswami is giving us a very important instruction here. If our only hope to get a glimpse of that love \u2013 the love that will make us eager for Krsna\u2019s love \u2013 is the association of devotees, then we really need to know what a loving exchange between devotees is.\n\n\n\tHow do I love Krsna\u2019s devotees? What do I do? How do I develop my love for them? Rupa Goswami says, \u201cThese six characteristics are the definition of love between one devotee and another.\u201d If you actually want to experience love with devotees, then in the same spirit that we would offer something to Krsna, offer it to His devotees. Give a devotee a gift. Not something we don\u2019t need, something that is meaningful to us. Love doesn\u2019t mean, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019ll give it to him.\u201d Is that an expression of love? No. Actually, that means I am relieving myself of the burden of something I don\u2019t want. But when we give something with love, we give our hearts. The true expression of our gift is in the thought \u201cIt\u2019s valuable to me, so let me give it to you.\u201d We give devotees gifts \u2013 something that\u2019s valuable to them. And it\u2019s value to them may not necessarily be seen in how much it costs. The more expensive the gift is, the more valuable it is to the devotee \u2013 no, that\u2019s not what it means. For a devotee, an object\u2019s value is determined by its connection to Krsna, or its connection to Krsna\u2019s devotees.\n\n\n\tWe can please Krsna\u2019s devotees very easily by giving them something that seems to be very simple. Krsna teaches this by His own example. He says, \u201cIf you offer Me a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water, I want it.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say, \u201cIf you offer Me a planet.\u201d No, \u201cA leaf or flower or fruit or water \u2013 I am very eager to accept it when it\u2019s offered with love.\u201d It\u2019s the love that is so attractive to Krsna. That\u2019s what makes Him feel, \u201cOh, I want that!\u201d It makes Krsna greedy to take the offering from His devotee, sometimes even before the devotee can put it in His hands! He knows. He sees the devotee\u2019s heart is so filled with love. He wants that offering, although externally it may appear very insignificant.\n\n\n\tKrsna proved this fact so many times, with so many of His devotees, by grabbing something out of their hands. He took Sudama Vipra\u2019s grains of broken rice, snatched them right out of his hands! He was so pleased to accept that offering, and He wanted more. But Rukmini, who is also the goddess of fortune, when she saw that Krsna wanted more, she said, \u201cStop! If You take more, I might not be able to give back enough to reciprocate what You\u2019ve taken from him!\u201d Krsna was so satisfied with those few grains of broken rice! Krsna shows by His own example that it doesn\u2019t require something very valuable by external calculations. What makes something valuable is the love; because love is there, the Lord is very eager to accept it. The devotee also is very eager to accept it. In that sense, Rupa Goswami says, \u201cGive some gift.\u201d Love also means accepting that gift. The pleasure of love is not only in giving but also in accepting an offering of love. This is reciprocation.\n\n\n\tGiving prasada. Accepting prasada. Everyone can relate to giving prasada. Srila Prabhupada was an ideal giver of prasada. But this was not the only way he showed his love. Srila Prabhupada also showed us his love in the way he transmitted transcendental knowledge of Krsna, which was a complete expression of his love for Krsna and his love for us, because he transmitted that knowledge without expecting anything in return. He was always giving more than we can possibly accept. He never expected anything for himself. It was his expression of love for Krsna and for those who take Krsna\u2019s message. His intention was to please Krsna by making others aware of Krsna\u2019s love. He was never interested in receiving anything in return. He didn\u2019t want fruitive gain. If somebody offered something to him, as he explains in this commentary\u2026If somebody offered something to him out of love or gratitude or appreciation for having received the gifts that Srila Prabhupada gave, then Prabhupada, out of love, would accept and use everything he\u2019d received for Krsna\u2019s service. That was his mood. Therefore, he also reciprocated completely. Although he was not interested in keeping anything for himself, on behalf of Krsna he would accept what he was given, and then give it to Krsna.\n\n\n\tHe is for us the fountainhead of loving exchanges. He taught us the real meaning of love, not just by his words but by his example as well. Not just by words \u2013 this is very important \u2013 but by his example he showed us the real meaning of love. He cooked the first Sunday Love Feast, with his own hands. He started cooking at 11 o\u2019clock at night on Saturday night. Two devotees were helping him, and Srila Prabhupada was making whatever he could the day before, because some preparations have to be made fresh on the day they\u2019re offered and distributed. At 11 o\u2019clock at night he was making sweet rice for the first Sunday Feast. He started cooking at 11, and he had two devotees helping him make this and other preparations as well. He also made gulabjamuns. Prabhupada called them \u201cISKCON bullets.\u201d Why did he call them ISKCON bullets? Because he knew that prasada is our weapon against maya. In fact, at the first Sunday Feats he made more gulabjamuns than could possibly be eaten. At least, he thought he made more than could be eaten\u2026But the devotees proved there weren\u2019t enough.\n\n\n\tOnly a few devotees and not many guests came for that first Sunday Love Feast. Prabhupada cooked for fifty people, but only a handful came for the first Sunday Love Feast. But everything was consumed. It was so tasty, because Prabhupada put his love in it. He finished cooking those preparations late at night, woke up early the following morning, chanted, gave class, and then immediately after class he went to the kitchen \u2013 and with the help of about six devotees \u2013 he prepared puris, samosas, and two kinds of sabji, even though nobody knew anything about cooking. One devotee asked Prabhupada, \u201cSwamiji\u2026\u201d This was 1966; Prabhupada was called \u201cSwamiji\u201d then. \u201cSwamiji, where did you learn how to cook like this?\u201d Prabhupada said, \u201cI watched my mother cooking. I\u2019ve learned everything from her.\u201d Prabhupada learned how to make so many wonderful preparations. The very first Sunday Feast was cooked by Prabhupada, and he taught everybody how to make the different preparations.\n\n\n\tSome of the new devotees were rolling puris for first time: square puris, long puris, all shapes \u2013 anything but round. Prabhupada took them all and cooked them. He accepted the devotees\u2019 service. They all helped him to cook this wonderful feast. If you\u2019ve ever made samosas before, you know it\u2019s not such an easy thing. You have to take a round puri, cut in in half, make a little cone out of it, put the filling inside, and then seal it perfectly so that it doesn\u2019t open. You take a little water, and then you have to seal it so that\u2026\n\n\n\tI learned this when I was with Radhanath Maharaja, Govinda Maharaja, and Bhaktivijnana Maharaja. We were cooking the feast together in Saint-Petersburg. I used to make samosas when I was the cook in 1975, but I could never make good samosas. I learned the art in 1998. Radhanath Maharaja showed me how to make them. He made the samosas for that feast. In fact, all four of us cooked all the preparations. And it was in a\u2026I don\u2019t want to digress too much, but it is connected. It was in a tiny kitchen that had one stove with electric burners. Try making samosas on electric burners. Try cooking a feast for 300 people at one stove with four burners. You can\u2019t even get a flame! But Govinda Maharaja, who was like the personification of cooking, who followed in the footsteps of Srila Prabhupada, so nicely making preparations that Radharani Herself could never resist. With this little stove with four burners he cooked a twelve-course feast for 300 people.\n\n\n\tIt was on Radhastami. I was making halava. Radhanath Maharaja was making the samosas. He showed us how to make the samosas and roll them properly. Still, after twenty years, even having been head cook in \u201975, I still couldn\u2019t do it just right. Then the real test came: after rolling all those samosas, we had to cook them. Because the burner of the stove was so small and it wasn\u2019t at high heat, the ghee wouldn\u2019t get hot enough. So we dropped the samosas into the ghee, and they would just fall down to the bottom. Samosas don\u2019t cook at the bottom of the pot. They\u2019re supposed to fall down and then immediately come right back up to the surface and fry on the surface of the ghee.\n\n\n\tWe were really discouraged. What are we going to do? How are we going to cook these samosas? All of us stood around the stove with our arms around each other, and we began praying to Srimati Radharani. We stood there looking at the pot, chanting tapta kancana gaurangi radhe vrindavanesvari/ vrisabhanu sute devi pranamami hari priye. We just stood there for about ten minutes, praying to Srimati Radhika. Tapta kancana gaurangi radhe vrindavanesvari\u2026And then we took a samosa and dropped it. It went down, and it came back up! It was cooking! Seriously, that\u2019s exactly what happened! I am not exaggerating. That\u2019s exactly what happened. We couldn\u2019t believe it! We dropped in about another fifteen samosas, and\u2026fshhh! They all rose to the top and started cooking. It was obviously because Srimati Radharani wanted samosas that day!\n\n\n\tSo, cooking samosas is not such an easy thing. Prabhupada also had a little stove, and he had to take these round puris that were cut in half and rolled by devotees who didn\u2019t know anything about rolling and cooking samosas. Still, he took everything and cooked it up and made this wonderful feast.\n\n\n\tAnd then, as Prabhupada would oftentimes do\u2026He would serve it out himself, showing the epitome, the embodiment of loving exchanges. At that time, I don\u2019t even know if you could call anyone that was present there \u201cdevotees.\u201d But still Prabhupada was giving it with so much love. And everyone present was accepting it. Prabhupada showed by his own example, by starting the Sunday Love Feast. One disciple had suggested to him, \u201cOn Sunday everybody usually stays home and eats with their family. Why don\u2019t we just cook a feast and invite everyone here?\u201d Prabhupada immediately said, \u201cYes, very good idea.\u201d This was on Saturday. Then the devotee said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we call it a \u2018Sunday Love Feast\u2019?\u201d And Prabhupada said, \u201cYes, very good idea!\u201d That\u2019s how it all started. After that first feast, Prabhupada said it must continue. Later Prabhupada said, \u201cIn every center, the Sunday Love Feast must continue.\u201d\n\n\n\tIn fact, Prabhupada had one time written in his own personal diary, in his own handwriting, the five things required to open a center. He said that there must be at least three devotees, they must go out chanting on the streets every morning and every evening, they must have a Sunday Love Feast every Sunday, and they must invite people to the Sunday Love Feast, and they must train others how to go out and chant with them every day, morning and evening. That is what he wrote as the criteria for opening a center. This was the expression of his love: offering prasada, food he had lovingly offered with his own hands to Krsna. He taught his followers, for generations to come, that this is another way of expressing love between devotees. It should be done with an attitude of love.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada says many other things in this commentary, which I unfortunately don\u2019t have time to read. But his main emphasis in the commentary is that\u2026By his own example he made love accessible \u2013 not simply by his words but by his example, and by his dealings with all of his guests and devotees. He was the embodiment of real love. Therefore, his greatest pleasure was to teach his followers how to continue that method of distribution, because the distribution of Krsna\u2019s love is very pleasing to Krsna, as Krsna Himself confirms in the Bhagavad-gita.\u00a0 Krsna says:\n\n\n\tna ca tasman manusyesu\n\tkascin me priya-krttamah\n\n\n\t\u201cThere is no servant in this world who is more dear to Me than one who distributes this knowledge of love for Me to others. Neither will there ever be anyone who is more dear.\u201d (BG 18.69)\n\n\n\tThis is a little description of love that may help us to understand why our acaryas, such as Srila Rupa Goswami, have put so much emphasis on learning how to love Krsna\u2019s devotees, and how to do so in a very practical way, with the proper attitude for expressing our love for Krsna described. We can express our love for Krsna\u2019s devotees by giving gifts, accepting gifts, revealing our mind in confidence \u2013 there is so much we can say about this topic, but we don\u2019t have enough time \u2013 inquiring confidentially, giving prasada, and accepting prasada. These six exchanges are ways that one devotee expresses his or her love to another.\n\n\n\tWhen these six exchanges are actually manifest in their true forms\u2026\u201cTrue forms\u201d means with love, or at least with the desire to do it with love. If we can\u2019t do it with love, at least we should develop the greed or the desire to do it with love, because that is the price we have to pay to obtain love. Even if we can\u2019t do it with love, we can still pray and desire to become greedy and anxious to learn that love. Because those loving exchanges are so attractive, Krsna accepts such service to His devotees to be as good as service to Him. That is Krsna\u2019s kindness. That is Krsna\u2019s love.\n\n\n\tKrsna even showed that by His own example. He says, \u201cBy the dust of the lotus feet of My pure devotees I desire to purify the entire material world, which is situated within Me.\u201d And therefore, He says, \u201cI will personally always follow behind, in the footsteps of My pure devotees, who are equal to everyone, who are always telling others about Me.\u201d Krsna says, \u201cI follow behind, in their footsteps, to take their dust.\u201d Krsna is very eager to accept that which is being offered to His devotees. He is very pleased to accept it. Simply by seeing these exchanges, it becomes very satisfying to the heart and becomes very attractive to others. When others see such loving exchanges, when they are praying with greed to obtain them, then they want to take part too. They will be eager to purchase that experience as well.\n\n\n\tThis is Caitanya Mahaprabhu\u2019s mission: to make this love accessible to everyone. That is the essence of His teachings, and of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s mission as well. Therefore, we have taken this opportunity to speak a little bit about love, although it is so difficult to describe. Actually, we have not even been able to scratch the surface.\n\n\n\tHare Krsna. Thank you very much.\n\n","nid":"10103"},{

He did not demand actual liberation from this material world, but at the end of his devotional service, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared before him, he was simply ashamed of the material demands he had in his mind.\n\n\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\n\n\n\tThis important verse has been discussed by many stalwart commentators. Why was Dhruva Maharaja not very pleased, even after achieving the goal of life he desired? A pure devotee is always free from any kind of material desires. In the material world, one\u2019s material desires are all most demonic; one thinks of others as one\u2019s enemies, one thinks of revenge against one\u2019s enemies, one aspires to become the topmost leader or topmost person in this material world, and thus one competes with all others. This has been described in the Bhagavad-gita, sixteenth chapter, as asuric. A pure devotee has no demand from the Lord. His only concern is to serve the Lord sincerely and seriously, and he is not at all concerned about what will happen in the future. In the Mukunda-mala-stotra, King Kulasekhara, author of the book, states in his prayer: \u201cMy dear Lord, I don\u2019t want any position of sense gratification within this material world. I simply want to engage in Your service perpetually.\u201d Similarly, Lord Caitanya, in His Siksastaka, also prayed, \u201cMy Lord, I do not want any amount of material wealth, I do not want any number of materialistic followers, nor do I want any attractive wife to enjoy. The only thing I want is that I may engage life after life in Your service.\u201d Lord Caitanya did not pray even for mukti, or liberation.\n\n\n\tIn this verse Maitreya replied to Vidura that Dhruva Maharaja, influenced by a revengeful attitude towards his insulting stepmother, did not think of mukti, nor did he know what mukti was. Therefore he failed to aim for mukti as his goal in life. But a pure devotee also does not want liberation. He is a soul completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord, and he does not demand anything from the Lord. This position was realized by Dhruva Maharaja when he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead present personally before him because he was elevated to the vasudeva platform. The vasudeva platform refers to the stage at which material contamination is conspicuous by absence only, or in other words where there is no question of the material modes of nature \u2013 goodness, passion, and ignorance \u2013 and one can therefore see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because on the vasudeva platform one can see God face to face, the Lord is also called Vasudeva.\n\n\n\tDhruva Maharaja\u2019s demand was for a position so exalted that it was never enjoyed even by Lord Brahma, his great-grandfather. Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is so affectionate and kind towards His devotee, especially to a devotee like Dhruva Maharaja, who went to render devotional service in the forest alone at the age of only five years, that although the motive might be impure, the Lord does not consider the motive; He is concerned with the service. But if a devotee has a particular motive, the Lord directly or indirectly knows it, and therefore He does not leave the devotee\u2019s material desires unfulfilled. These are some of the special favors by the Lord to a devotee.\n\n\n\t\n\tPURPORT by Niranjana Swami\n\n\n\tThis verse is Maitreya\u2019s answer to the question posed by Vidura we spoke about yesterday. Vidura was inquiring how, even though Dhruva Maharaja achieved such an exalted position in one life, Dhruva was still not pleased. Vidura thought Dhruva would have felt satisfied at having achieved the fulfillment of his desires, especially because they were fulfilled directly by the Lord. Maitreya answers here in this verse, and in the following verses he will continue his answer.\n\n\n\tAlthough Dhruva Maharaja was completely purified by his association with the Lord, he was still feeling repentance, humility, and even disgust with his previous behavior. What made him think that way? It was what the Lord had to say to him. The Lord referred to Dhruva\u2019s previous desires and his previous vow. When the Lord appeared to him, Dhruva Maharaja prayed: \u201cI only want the association of Your devotees.\u201d He said that in purified consciousness. But he was thinking: \u201cAfter I heard what the Lord told me, the Lord might think I was trying to deceive Him, because that\u2019s not what I asked from Him before. And, not only that, when He came to me to give me a benediction, the only thing He mentioned was the desire I had before and how He was going to fulfill that desire.\u201d\n\n\n\tThat was just a few verses ago. You might remember what the Lord told Dhruva. He told him: \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a planet, the polestar, which is greater than the planet of your great grandfather, Lord Brahma, because it\u2019s spiritual, eternal.\u201d That was what Dhruva wanted \u2013\u00a0 he wanted a kingdom greater than Lord Brahma\u2019s. The Supreme Lord even told Dhruva: \u201cIn addition to the polestar, your stepmother, Suruci, is going to be killed in a forest fire along with her son, who you\u2019re also very angry with because he had the privilege of sitting on your father\u2019s lap, a privilege you didn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n\n\tIn other words, the Lord was very conscious of what Dhruva Maharaja had approached Him for, and He made note of it when He spoke to Dhruva. The Lord didn\u2019t say: \u201cOh, Dhruva, I know that you only wanted these things before, so I\u2019m not even going to bother mentioning them to you. You are going to rule the polestar for 36,000 years in a completely purified state of consciousness and then go back to Godhead.\u201d That\u2019s what the Lord didn\u2019t say. The Lord specifically told him: \u201cYou\u2019ll get a kingdom greater than your great grandfather\u2019s kingdom, and your stepmother will be killed along with your stepbrother.\u201d Dhruva was thinking: \u201cI can\u2019t believe how I was thinking before. I had such demoniac desires, because of my attachment.\u201d That\u2019s how a demon thinks. A demon thinks: \u201cI want something better than everyone else, and if anyone gets in my way, I want them destroyed.\u201d\n\n\n\tThose are demoniac qualities, as Prabhupada is explaining here in the commentary. That\u2019s what Dhruva Maharaja was feeling: \u201cI was actually thinking that way. Not only that, but I made a vow that I will get it.\u201d Narada Muni tried to discourage Dhruva by saying, \u201cWait a minute. You are just a young boy now. You are not going to get involved in all these things.\u201d But Dhruva Maharaja expressed his determination: \u201cNo. You\u2019re not going to in any way divert me from my goal in life.\u201d That was his goal. His goal in life was to get a planet better than Lord Brahma\u2019s, and in that way have his revenge. When he realized that in his heart, he was thinking: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought that way.\u201d This is a symptom of purified consciousness.\n\n\n\tThe symptom of purified consciousness is not that a devotee simply experiences great ecstasy by fixation upon the lotus feet of the Lord but also sincerely repents for all the sinful desires and sinful things from his or her past. In Dhruva\u2019s case, he realized that the Lord was even fulfilling those earlier, impure desires. That was the symptom he manifested after receiving the benediction of the Lord. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada begins his commentary by elaborating specifically on the dangers of such material desires. He says many stalwart commentators have discussed this important verse. He says that in the material world one\u2019s material desires are all most demoniac. Why? Because one thinks of others as one\u2019s enemies and desires revenge. One aspires to become the topmost leader, the topmost person, and thus one competes with others. These are the dangers of material desires.\n\n\n\tMaterial desires not only cover us but prevent us from seeing others from the spiritual platform. Rather than seeing everyone else as servants of the Supreme Lord and ourselves as their servants, we think of others as competitors who can potentially obstruct the fulfillment of our desires. Prabhupada specifically states that all material desires are demoniac. That is the nature of material desires. Therefore, he explains that a pure devotee of the Lord is always free from such material desires, because a pure devotee places no demands on the Lord. His only concern is to serve the Lord sincerely and seriously; he is not at all concerned about what will happen in the future.\n\n\n\tWhy is a pure devotee not at all concerned about what will happen in the future? Because a pure devotee is one who has complete faith in service to the Lord. And because of that complete faith in service to the Lord, the pure devotee knows that the opportunity to serve will fulfill all needs. \u201cThat will be my shelter. That will be my complete protection from the influence of the material energy. That will be my complete protection from the influence of material desires. That will satisfy me beyond any other experience of this world.\u201d Because a pure devotee thinks this way, his or her eagerness is always for the opportunity to serve the Lord. The pure devotee\u2019s every effort in life is to secure the opportunity to serve, both through prayer and meditation and, therefore, through actions.\n\n\n\tWhen a devotee of the Lord has such an intense desire to always serve, then the Lord eradicates all obstacles automatically, including material desires and all other material impediments \u2013 a devotee doesn\u2019t have to worry about those. The Lord takes care of all this for His devotee. The Lord can eradicate obstacles much better than we can. But if we are not so dedicated in the service of the Lord, we will think in the opposite way. Rather than intensely desiring the service of the Lord, we will think about how to remove obstacles.\n\n\n\tIf those obstacles are material desires, we\u2019ll think: \u201cThe way I remove the obstacles is to get my material desires fulfilled so I don\u2019t have to worry about them, because that\u2019s the obstacle to my service. If I have what I want, then I can think about service, so I have to get rid of this obstacle. This is an obstacle to my service. Krsna, put everything on hold. I\u2019ll come back and serve later. You know I want to serve You, don\u2019t You? You know that. So please trust me. I know I look like I\u2019m busy with something else for now, but really I\u2019m thinking of You. Believe me. As soon as I take care of this obstacle, I promise I\u2019ll come back. Please don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m Your servant. OK? Deal? You agree? OK. Now I\u2019m going to deal with this obstacle.\u201d\n\n\n\tBut the Lord knows how to remove obstacles much better than we do. We think: \u201cThese desires are obstacles, and I need to take care of them. I have to get them fulfilled.\u201d But the Lord says: \u201cWhat are you doing, My dear child? The obstacle is your attachment to these things. You should be attached to serving Me. I\u2019ll take care of the obstacles.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t trust the way You take care of the obstacles. I\u2019ve seen what happens when You take care of obstacles. I\u2019ve read Srimad-Bhagavatam. I see what You do. You\u2019re a thief. You\u2019re a tricky character. I don\u2019t trust You enough yet.\u201d \u201cOK. That\u2019s what you want, then? You take care of your obstacles,\u201d Krsna will say.\n\n\n\tBut Krsna can take care of them in a very wonderful way, as He did with Dhruva Maharaja. Dhruva Maharaja became completely purified in heart. And then, being completely purified in heart, as Prabhupada says here in the commentary, he came to the Vasudeva platform and was able to see the Lord face to face. The Lord also gave Dhruva Maharaja the opportunity to continue serving in this world for 36,000 years because, as Prabhupada explains in the previous commentary, the Lord knew it would not be an obstacle to Dhruva Maharaja. It is not that the Lord put more obstacles in Dhruva\u2019s path by asking him to stay and to rule for 36,000 years. The Lord knew that his ruling as a king for 36,000 years, getting married, and everything else that comes with being a king, would not be an obstacle for Dhruva\u2019s service.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada explains that just before this verse: \u201cGenerally the Lord does not award a pure devotee material opulence even though he may desire it. But Dhruva Maharaja\u2019s case was different. The Lord knew that he was such a great devotee and in spite of having material opulence he will never be deviated from the Love of Godhead. This example illustrates that a highly-qualified devotee can have a facility of material enjoyment and at the same time execute love of God.\u201d This however was a special case with Dhruva Maharaja. We should not think: \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m going to, in a very determined way, ask the Lord to fulfill my material desires.\u201d We should not expect to get the same result Dhruva Maharaja got because, as Prabhupada says here, he was a special case. Of course, we all tend to think we are a special case, but we have to be careful in thinking that way.\n\n\n\tTherefore, a devotee is the one who understands what a valuable opportunity it is to serve the Lord. And for that reason, in the forefront of his mind, his meditation, his prayers, he is always eager to request the Lord for the opportunity to serve Him. In this Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam is the well-known verse that says the Supreme Lord is very dear to those devotees who have no material possessions and who are fully satisfied in possessing only devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Indeed, the Lord relishes the activities of such devotees. In other words, that is what gives the Lord pleasure. The Lord becomes very pleased when He sees His devotee\u2019s determination to serve Him despite all obstacles.\n\n\n\tTherefore, we may oftentimes ask: \u201cWhy are there so many obstacles. Why isn\u2019t the path just clear? Why are all the obstacles not immediately removed?\u201d If anybody examines their own personal life and their efforts to serve, they will see that there are many obstacles. Sometimes we become overwhelmed by these obstacles and are diverted from our determination to keep our spiritual vows. Why are these obstacles there? Because we need to be purified, and without obstacles we tend to be less dependent upon the Lord. If there are no obstacles, what reason do I have to depend on the Lord? Because we haven\u2019t really achieved the Vasudeva platform \u2013 at which point we are always completely conscious of the Lord \u2013 we sometimes become complacent in our remembrance of the Lord and our desire to serve Him. Therefore, these obstacles on the path of devotional service do not have to be obstacles.\n\n\n\tA devotee is someone who sees what the obstacles are and always tries to overcome them by increasing his or her dependence on the mercy of the Lord and His devotees. Instead of being obstacles, they become steppingstones for progressing closer to our goal. Therefore the Lord is very kind and He knows how to bring His devotee to Him.\n\n\n\tAs Prabhupada explains later in his commentary, the Lord knows the desires that are there in the heart. He knows the motive. \u201c\u2026If a devotee has a particular motive, the Lord directly or indirectly knows it, and therefore He does not leave the devotee\u2019s material desires unfulfilled.\u201d But the Lord knows how to fulfill those desires in such a way that it brings His devotee closer to Him. Therefore, He removes the obstacles on the path of devotional service for His devotee. As it was stated, this is a very important verse for us to understand. We should be very careful what we pray for; otherwise we may find ourselves in a very lamentable state, just as Dhruva Maharaja has found himself now.\n\n\n\tDhruva Maharaja is lamenting. He\u2019s feeling disgusted with himself. He\u2019s repenting for his previous desires. Even though the Lord personally appeared before him and gave him the benediction, he still wasn\u2019t fully satisfied at heart. Of course, we should understand that his lamentation was a sign of humility and his complete surrender to the Lord; the Lord within the heart of Dhruva Maharaja reveals this to him in due course of time. Still, we should understand the dangers of such desires. We should pray to the Lord not for the fulfillment of those desires but to eradicate those desires that are obstacles on our path to serve Him. That is a sincere practitioner, or sadhaka, of devotional service. When a devotee stands firm in conviction, in prayers to the Lord, and is ready to accept whatever plan the Lord has made for the future, that is the difference.\n\n\n\tThat is how a devotee becomes fearless: he places his future in Krsna\u2019s hands and has full faith that Krsna knows best how to make arrangements for him. Therefore, as Srila Prabhupada quotes Lord Caitanya in his commentary: \u201cAll I want is Your service birth after birth after birth. Even if I have to take birth after birth after birth, what difference does it make? As long as I have Your service, that is for me a liberated activity.\u201d\n\tThere are other points also brought out in this verse: Dhruva Maharaja did not demand liberation from the material world. Prabhupada brings that out in the commentary, and later on he explains why Dhruva didn\u2019t demand liberation \u2013 because devotional service is in itself a liberated activity.\n\n\n\tThank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n\n","nid":"10100"},{

No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with determination, one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.\u2019\u201d (BG 15.3\u20134)\n\n\n\tPurport by Niranjana Swami\n\n\n\tThis is the last verse of Jada Bharata\u2019s instructions to Maharaja Rahugana. Jada Bharata is giving Maharaja Rahugana an introduction to the forest of material sense enjoyment, detailing many of the implications that come from attachment to material life and the frustrations that come from them. I won\u2019t go through them all; I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve read them. But it\u2019s quite a substantial list. The living entity who is bound by fruitive activities in this material world, though being kicked again and again, still comes back for more.\n\n\n\tThat was yesterday\u2019s verse: \u201cIf he [the conditioned soul] gets out of this dangerous position, he again returns home to enjoy sex life, for that is the way of attachment. Thus under the spell of the Lord\u2019s material energy, he continues to lord it in the forest of material existence. He does not discover his real interest even at the point of death.\u201d (SB 5.13.19)\n\n\n\tAfter explaining all of this to King Rahugana, Jada Bharata is now concluding by saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to cut yourself free from this identification because you are also a victim of the external energy and you are situated on the path of attraction to material pleasure.\u201d Jada Bharata says, \u201cI\u2019m advising you to sever your connection with the illusory position you have identified with for so long, so that you may become an equal friend to all living entities. Give up your attraction to the sense objects and take up the sword of knowledge sharpened by devotional service.\u201d\n\n\n\tThe verse quoted in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s commentary is from the fifteenth chapter of the Bhagavad-gita, which describes the existence of a banyan tree whose roots grow upwards and branches grow down. No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is in the material world. Of course, this is a description of the tree of fruitive activity. It\u2019s also described that the leaves of the tree are the words of the Vedas. And therefore with the weapon of knowledge one has to become detached and cut down this tree.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada explains in his Bhagavad-gita commentary that we have no experience of trees like this in this world. Of course there is the banyan tree, about which we are speaking, but Prabhupada explains that the tree of the material world is more like the reflection of a tree upon the water. He explains that this material world is just like a reflection of the spiritual world. Although we do not see such trees existing in this world, they can be seen if one looks at the reflection of a tree in the water. Prabhupada says that just as the reflection of a tree in water is based on the existence of the water, the \u201creflection\u201d of the tree known as the material world is based on the existence of desire.\n\n\n\tIn many places Prabhupada explains the nature of this reflection, especially in the verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam spoken by the Supreme Lord within the heart of Lord Brahma, rite \u2019rtham yat pratiyeta na pratiyeta catmani: \u201cWhatever you see of any value, if it has no connection with Me, you should know it to be My illusory energy, or that reflection which appears in the darkness.\u201d (SB 2.9.34)\n\n\n\tIn this verse it is clearly explained how the material energy is dependent upon the Supreme Lord; it is connected to the Supreme Lord in the same way that a reflection is connected to the sunlight. He says, the sunlight is considered in this example to be like the absolute truth, and the reflection and darkness are two truths relative to the sun. That means they have no existence independent of the sun \u2013 when the sun is blocked, there is darkness. And a reflection is the projection of light into the darkness, so the reflection is also dependent upon sunlight. Prabhupada says that the Absolute Truth is appreciated in relationship to these two relative truths, the Absolute Truth being compared to the sun.\n\n\n\tKrsna-surya-sama maya haya andhakara: \u201cKrsna is like the sunshine, Maya is like darkness. Wherever there is sunshine there cannot be darkness.\u201d (CC Madhya 22.31)\n\n\n\tIn the same way, for one who takes to Krsna consciousness, immediately the darkness, or the influence of the illusory energy, is dissipated. Someone may think that darkness is not dependent on the sun. This is true if one is in the material world, which is a place of darkness. But one should understand what Prabhupada is saying: that the real substance of existence is the spiritual world, which is self-illuminating. Just as the sun is self-illuminating \u2013 there is no darkness on the sun. When one actually describes the existence of the spiritual world, one should understand it to be self-illuminating, always effulgent. Darkness only exists when that self-illuminating object is covered.\n\n\n\tThe darkness is actually connected to light; it exists when the light is covered. Prabhupada explains that that is the nature of the material world. The material world is comprised of Krsna\u2019s material energy, which is always connected to Krsna. Maya, or the illusory energy cannot exist without Krsna. As Krsna says, mama maya duratyaya: \u201cIt is My maya.\u201d (BG 7.14)\n\n\n\tMayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: \u201cThis material nature works according to My direction and produces all moving and non-moving beings.\u201d (BG 9.10) Therefore, whatever we see to be of value in this world, if it has no connection to substance, to the spiritual world, we should know that it\u2019s the illusory energy.\n\n\n\tUnfortunately, most people don\u2019t know that. They don\u2019t identify the things of this world as the illusory energy. They identify this world as reality. And though the material world is real, it\u2019s temporary. But the eternal spiritual soul\u2019s real connection is with that which is eternal, with the spiritual world, which is self-effulgent. Prabhupada says that this tree with its roots growing up and its branches growing down is actually the reflection that one sees of the tree in the water. It\u2019s only a reflection; it has no substance.\n\n\n\tI remember one time I was staying at the home of a devotee in Ukraine. We were staying in a city where it was quite corrupt, quite dangerous, so he decided he would keep a dog in his yard at all times to prevent thieves from coming and breaking into his house. One time, I was preparing to leave his home, and the dog was walking back and forth in the yard. It was a very sunny day, and when I came outside the door my watch was reflecting light onto the wall. I didn\u2019t know, obviously. I didn\u2019t see it when I walked out. But the dog did. I was looking straight ahead, and I watched the dog run and lunge right into the wall. I said to the owner, \u201cHave you had your dog checked for rabies lately? He seems to be going mad.\u201d Then the dog walked back and all of a sudden ran and threw his mouth into the wall and smashed his mouth against the wall. It looked like he was trying to catch something. He did it so hard that I could have sworn the dog broke its teeth and its nose! Then finally, I discovered that it was the reflection from my watch that the dog was chasing. So I started to move my arm like this. And the dog was trying to catch the reflection. I said to the owner, \u201cYou see? This is what happens when we become attached to the reflection that is the material world.\u201d\n\n\n\tThis is a very graphic example, because the dog actually thought this reflection was something substantial, something real. The dog actually thought that when he clamped his jaws on it he was going to catch something. But there was no substance; there was just a reflection.\n\n\n\tIn the same way, this whole material world is a reflection. Everything that exists in this world is simply \u2013 as we understand according to the tree of the material world reflected in the water of desire \u2013 it\u2019s a reflection of the substance of the spiritual world. But, being covered by Krsna\u2019s illusory energy, one thinks that which has value is here in this world. And therefore Krsna says, \u201cWhatever you see that has any value in this world, if you don\u2019t see how it\u2019s connected to Me, the substance, then it\u2019s My illusory energy.\u201d (SB 2.9.34)\n\n\n\tIf we really appreciated its value, we would appreciate its value in terms of its connection with the Lord. That\u2019s what makes everything in this world valuable, when it\u2019s connected to the Lord. As Prabhupada says, when you have so many zeros, you add them up and they equal zero. But if you want to make your zeros valuable, you have to connect them to one. Then immediately every zero becomes valuable because it\u2019s connected to \u201cthe one,\u201d who is Krsna. Therefore, whatever we see in this world that we think is valuable, if we don\u2019t see its connection with Krsna, then it\u2019s maya. Nothing else. We can\u2019t identify it to be anything except the illusory energy. That is why the Bhagavatam places so much emphasis on spiritual values, because a thing\u2019s value is determined by its connection with the Supreme.\n\n\n\ttulayama lavenapi\n\tna svargam napunar-bhavam\n\tbhagavat-sangi-sangasya\n\tmartyanam kim utasishah\n\n\n\t\u201cThe value of a moment\u2019s association of a devotee of the lord cannot be compared to elevation to heavenly planets, to liberation from matter, or to worldly prosperity, which is ultimately for those who are meant for death.\u201d (SB 1.18.13) The Bhagavatam states that one moment\u2019s association with a devotee of the Lord can\u2019t be compared to all these other things.\n\n\n\tAll worldly prosperity, liberation, even going to the heavenly planets to enjoy heavenly opulences for a very long time \u2013 association with a devotee is more valuable than all of these, because by that one moment\u2019s association one can get connected with Krsna. The Bhagavatam (2.1.12) also states, \u201cWhat is the value of prolonged life which is wasted, inexperienced by years in this world? Better one moment of full consciousness, because that will enable one to search after his ultimate interest.\u201d Better to live for a moment in full consciousness than to live for hundreds of years in total forgetfulness of one\u2019s connection with the Lord. Therefore the Bhagavatam also says that the value of a moment\u2019s association with a devotee cannot be compared to all these other things, because in one moment one can actually, by the mercy of a devotee, make a connection with Krsna, and sever the connection with the material world. By making a connection with Krsna, we sever our connection with the material world.\n\n\n\tThat\u2018s exactly the point Jada Bharata is now making to Maharaja Rahugana. Jada Bharata has given so much knowledge about transcendence. Therefore, after giving Maharaja Rahugana knowledge of transcendence, now Jada Bharata says, \u201cOk, cut. Cut.\u201d It is explained that one has to cut down this banyan tree of the material world by detachment. And that detachment comes from knowledge \u2013 knowledge of the Supreme Lord and knowledge of devotional service of the Lord.\n\n\n\t\u201cWith determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. Thereafter, one must seek that place where, having once gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whom everything began and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.\u201d (BG 15.3\u20134)\n\n\n\tBut we know that voluntarily severing that connection is not very easy for us to do. Therefore, the Bhagavatam also states:\n\n\n\tvasudeve bhagavati\n\tbhakti-yogah prayojitah\n\tjanayaty asu vairagyam\n\tjnanam ca yad ahaitukam\n\n\n\t\u201cBy rendering devotional service to the Supreme Lord, one automatically acquires knowledge and detachment from this world.\u201d (SB 1.2.7)\n\n\n\tIn order to be able to render that devotional service we must be very, very conscientious about seeing what is valuable to us \u2013 what is really valuable, not the reflection but the substance. Wherever we appreciate the reflection, we should understand we have the tendency to appreciate the reflection because that same nature has its origin in the spiritual world. Attachment to friends, family, and society are all natural because it\u2019s natural to have relationships in the spiritual world, where Krsna is the center. In the spiritual world that same natural attraction we have in this world for a connection or a relationship is firmly grounded in our eternal connection with Krsna. That is to say, the attraction we feel for relationships in the material world is a reflection when it\u2019s firmly connected to Krsna in the spiritual world. What makes the connection firm? In the material world everything will be taken away, so whatever connection we have here is temporary. But when it\u2019s connected to Krsna, that connection is solid because Krsna never lets His devotees go.\n\n\n\tPrabhupada explains this in his Bhagavad-gita commentary. He says that the devotee is like a jewel, and a jewel is very valuable. The devotee is like a jewel because Krsna holds the devotee in His hand and won\u2019t let go. When a person has a very valuable jewel in his hands, he\u2019s very careful to hold it tightly.\n\n\n\tOr sometimes \u2013 it\u2019s not a jewel \u2013 but for me, because I travel so much, I will sometimes have my wallet in my hand with my passport, my documents, and my visas. And whenever I\u2019m walking through the airport, I always hold on to these things tightly. Some of my godbrothers have lost everything in the airport. People work in teams \u2013 someone distracts you while the other one takes everything very quickly. This happens especially in Russia, where there are a lot of gypsies at the airport. They just clean everybody out.\n\n\n\tSo, if you have something of value, you hold onto it tightly so you don\u2019t lose it. Prabhupada gives the same example, saying that the devotee is like a valuable jewel. When you have a valuable jewel in your hand, you hold it very tightly so it\u2019s not lost. That is how the connection is established; that is how Krsna protects His devotee.\n\n\n\tKrsna says, kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: \u201cDeclare it boldly Arjuna, My devotee will never be vanquished.\u201d (BG 9.31) \u201cWhen My devotee goes there \u2013 tad dhama paramam mama, that is My eternal abode \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have to come back again.\u201d (BG 8.21) And, janma karma ca me divyam: \u201cOne who understands the transcendental nature of My appearance and My activities in this world doesn\u2019t have to take his birth again in this material world.\u201d (BG 4.9)\n\n\n\tIn other words, the connection is not one-sided. When the connection is firm, it\u2019s firm because Krsna is holding on tightly and protecting His devotee. That is how to be protected from the material world. \u201cOne who is not connected to the Supreme can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a controlled mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?\u201d (BG 2.66) Connection means both things: The devotee always holds on to Krsna\u2019s lotus feet \u2013 praying to be an atom at Krsna\u2019s lotus feet, praying that he may always serve Krsna \u2013 and Krsna therefore always gives the devotee shelter at His lotus feet.\n\n\n\tThat is why it\u2019s described in the Bhagavatam that even though one may perform very severe austerities and penances to detach himself from this material world, he simply thinks himself to be liberated.\n\n\n\tye \u2018nye \u2018ravindaksha vimukta-maninas\n\ttvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\n\taruhya kricchrena param padam tatah\n\tpatanty adho \u2018nadrita-yushmad-anghrayah\n\t(SB 10.2.32)\n\n\n\tThey fall down from that position of imagined superiority because they don\u2019t have the shelter of Krsna\u2019s lotus feet. They have no connection with Krsna through service. They have simply tried to detach themselves from this world; they have made no connection with Krsna through service. It is service to Krsna that is the connection, nothing else.\n\n\n\tAnd what is their service? It\u2019s all based on desire. The reflection of the tree is seen on the water in same way that the reflection of the material world rests upon our desires. Therefore there is a verse in the Bhagavatam, in Narada Muni\u2019s instructions to Vyasadeva. I have given this example before: about a thing that, if therapeutically applied, can cure the disease that has been caused by the very same thing. One may get a stomach disorder from taking too many milk products. But the cure for this stomach disorder is to take yogurt, which is another milk product. That which caused the disease, when therapeutically applied, can also be the cure. But how, in relation to our material attachments, do we \u201ctherapeutically apply\u201d something? We have to look at what our attachments are and see how those attachments are binding us to this world. \u201cTherapeutically applying\u201d those attachments means connecting them to Krsna.\n\n\n\tAs Bhaktivinoda Thakura prays, manasa deha geha jo kichu mora: \u201cMy wife, my home, my family \u2013 all of these, Krsna, belong to You.\u201d He also prays to the Lord, \u201cLet me simply be like the household dog of Your home. Let me stand outside Your home and bark to protect it.\u201d Bhaktivinoda Thakura prays like that: \u201cIt\u2019s Your home. My wife, my family, my children \u2013 they all belong to You. This home belongs to You. I\u2019m Your dog, so let me stay outside Your home and simply bark to protect it from anyone who tries to disturb Your home.\u201d\n\n\n\tIn other words, to \u201ctherapeutically apply\u201d something means to see how those things we\u2019re attached to can be connected to the Supreme. It also means not to see that they\u2019re valuable because they\u2019re connected to me: my wife, my husband, my home, my wealth\u2026mine. It\u2019s valuable because it\u2019s mine. But Krsna says, \u201cIf you see that something is valuable, but you don\u2019t see its connection to Me, it\u2019s maya.\u201d This is a fundamental law of the material world, and Krsna created that maya so that you can forget Him. And Maya works very wonderfully; she\u2019s a very powerful woman, and she does her service very well, much more powerfully than we can do ours. Therefore we should never think that we can overcome maya by our own strength. We should know that our method for overcoming maya and cutting our connections with this material world is dependence on the Lord.\n\n\n\n\tAs Krsna says, yoginam api sarvesam mad-gatenantar-atmana: \u201cOf all yogis, he who abides in Me with great faith, worshipping Me in devotional service, is intimately connected with Me, and is the highest of all.\u201d (BG 6.47) Some yogis try to detach themselves from this world, but they simply fall. But the devotee who always seeks shelter at Krsna\u2019s lotus feet by constantly being engaged in His transcendental loving service will always be protected by the Lord.\n\n\n\tTherefore we should be very careful not to become like the foolish dog who chases the reflection of light on the wall, thinking that it has substance. There is no substance. There is only a reflection. A reflection is completely dependent upon the light coming from some other source; it has no substance of its own.\n\n\n\tI just want to end by reading one very wonderful quote from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. I like this quote. It\u2019s an answer to the question \u201cHow should we treat the material world?\u201d He says:\n\n\n\t\u201cWe should see this material world and everything in it as full of the ingredients for the Lord\u2019s service. Everything in this world is meant for Krsna\u2019s service. The day when we can look at the world like this, and become liberated from the material conception, we will be able to see the material world as the spiritual world, Goloka. We should treat all women as Krsna\u2019s beloveds. They are to be enjoyed by Him. Do not look at them with an enjoying spirit. They are meant to be enjoyed by Krsna, never by the living entities. Treat your father and mother as Krsna\u2019s father and mother. Instead of considering your children your servants, treat them as friends of child Krsna. Then you will not see the material world everywhere, but Goloka.\u201d (Amrita Vani)\n\n\n\tHare Krsna. We can end here. Srila Prabhupada ki jaya!\n\n","nid":"9743"},{

This is the story of Ambarish Maharaja.\n\tsa itthamm bhakti-yogena\n\ttapo-yuktena parthivah\n\tsva-dharmena harim prinan\n\tsarvan kaman sanair jahau\n\tSYNONYMS\n\tsah -- he (Ambarisa Maharaja); ittham -- in this way; bhakti-yogena -- by performing transcendental loving service to the Lord; tapah-yuktena -- which is simultaneously the best process of austerity; parthivah -- the king; sva-dharmena -- by his constitutional activities; harim -- unto the Supreme Lord; prinan -- satisfying; sarvan -- all varieties of; kaman -- material desires; sanaih -- gradually; jahau -- gave up.\n\tTRANSLATION\n\tThe king of this planet, Maharaja Ambarisa, thus performed devotional service to the Lord and in this endeavor practiced severe austerity. Always satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his constitutional activities, he gradually gave up all material desires.\n\tPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\n\tSevere austerities in the practice of devotional service are of many varieties. For example, in worshiping the Deity in the temple there are certainly laborious activities. Sri-vigraharadhana-nitya-nana srngara-tan-mandira-marjanadau. One must decorate the Deity, cleanse the temple, bring water from the Ganges and Yamuna, continue the routine work, perform arati many times, prepare first-class food for the Deity, prepare dresses and so on. In this way, one must constantly be engaged in various activities, and the hard labor involved is certainly an austerity. Similarly, the hard labor involved in preaching, preparing literature, preaching to atheistic men, and distributing literature door to door is of course an austerity (tapo-yuktena). Tapo divyam putraka. Such austerity is necessary. Yena sattvam suddhyet. By such austerity in devotional service, one is purified of material existence (kaman sanair jahau). Indeed, such austerity leads one to the constitutional position of devotional service. In this way one can give up material desires, and as soon as one is freed from material desires, he is free from the repetition of birth and death, old age and disease.\n\tPURPORT by Niranjana Swami\n\tI wanted to begin today by reading something from Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, because we are gathered today to increase our appreciation of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books. Many other activities will be recognized today, especially those devotees who have dedicated themselves to giving time to distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, but first we should understand that the very foundation upon which we are standing in our Krishna consciousness is Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books. If we base our Krishna consciousness on this foundation, it will give us strength to endure the austerities required in the execution of devotional service.\n\tFor example, I remember the years I was fully engaged in book distribution and was distributing books practically every day. During that time, Prabhupada emphasized that we should build our day on first hearing from his books. In fact there was even one time I remember when devotees put forward an idea that we should stay in the temple and study Prabhupada\u2019s books for five or six hours a day. I think the idea came from New York. Some of the devotees were questioning whether or not Prabhupada would approve of this, so they wrote to Prabhupada and asked. And Prabhupada wrote back; he said \u201cNo, two hours a day is sufficient.\u201d He said everybody should gather in the morning for class, and in the evening for class, and the rest of the time should be dedicated to distributing books, because that is our most important activity.\n\tThat was a general principle which many of us followed for many years. Though, in due course of time, when we began spending more time distributing books, we used to have our evening classes by ourselves. We would read [by ourselves]. Or, at the end of a day of book distribution, we would have hot milk and read \u201cKrishna Book\u201d together. But, every morning, there was no question of not reading something from Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books.\n\tPersonally, I was able to consume a lot of the knowledge Srila Prabhupada has given us in his books by giving Srimad-Bh\u00e4gavatam class every morning. During those years I was distributing books, I believe, I can\u2019t remember a day that I didn\u2019t give Srimad-Bhagavatam class from Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books.\n\tAlthough on some days, because I was the sankirtana leader, I would cook and give class at the same time. In fact, most days were like that. Because we had everything down to a science \u2013 how to prepare breakfast so you could just put everything on the stove and then give class and everything would cook automatically. Of course, sometimes it was a little hazardous doing things that way, because if you get really absorbed in the Bhagavatam sometimes you forget that there\u2019s something on the stove. I can remember many times starting fires in motel rooms and having to get out of the room very quickly, because the alarms would go off (and because there were always a few more people in the room than we had said when checking in).\n\tAnyway, I could tell stories all day about these things, but that\u2019s not the point of emphasis for discussion this morning. The point is that every single morning there was Srimad-Bhagavatam class. And practically most of the Srimad-Bhagavatam I read for the first time while on travelling sankirtan by having class every morning. And, generally, our experience was that by reading from Srila Prabhupada\u2019s book every morning and associating with him in that way we could gain the inspiration required to finish the day\u2019s ten to twelve hours of book distribution.\n\tAlthough I have certainly read from Srimad-Bhagavatam many times since those years I was distributing books every day, my personal experience is that the Bhagavatam was never more alive to me than when I was distributing Prabhupada\u2019s books. It was a living experience to read Srila Prabhupada\u2019s commentaries and purports and then to apply them and see how they were applicable in modern day society.\n\tEspecially in the First Canto of the Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada put so much emphasis in his commentary on how important it is to introduce this knowledge to modern society. I remember that, although I was travelling most of the time and I wasn\u2019t taking part in the Bhagavatam classes at the temple, when the devotees at the temple read the First Canto, first chapter, first verse, they gave class on that verse for thirty days. Every day the devotees were just sharing their realizations and making commentary on the first verse and purport of Bhagavatam. The general experience is that Prabhupada\u2019s commentaries are impregnated with so much wisdom and inspiration. It is for this reason, having experienced this myself and having seen so many devotees grow up in Krishna consciousness, nourished by Srila Prabhupada\u2019s translations and commentaries, that we find it necessary sometimes to remind devotees \u2013 again and again and again \u2013 that even though there are so many other books available, if you don\u2019t have a foundation in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, you are cheating yourself. Because when you have that foundation in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, you\u2019ll see that Prabhupada packed everything in his books. And although you may read other books at other times after you have read all of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, when you come back and read Prabhupada\u2019s books, you\u2019ll see how Prabhupada already put everything there! Although maybe [when we first read Prabhupada\u2019s books] we hadn\u2019t performed sufficient austerities to mine the jewels yet.\n\tIt\u2019s hard work to mine jewels. In fact, my godbrother Syamasundar Prabhu, who used to do this type of work, was just recently commissioned by a television station to do a reality TV show. Last year they filmed in India, where he went with a whole crew of people to mine diamonds. He agreed to take part only if he could somehow get Krishna consciousness into the show. It\u2019s a six part series, and it\u2019s actually showing this month. The television crew came to Radha-Gopinath Mandir last year \u2013 I think it was February \u2013 in order to obtain blessings for successful mining. Actually, he wanted me to give the blessings. But I was thinking \u201cOh, Krishna! I don't know if I can do this.\u201d Then the director of the show said, \u201cNo, we want somebody in an Indian body.\u201d I was relieved. But anyway, I don\u2019t want to get into the whole show. The point is that the show depicts the kind of difficulties one has to endure to actually get to the place where there are valuable diamonds. Especially in India. And especially on the particular tract of land they had to go to that was practically un-pioneered. Because, according to tradition, that\u2019s where the most valuable jewels can be found. So, [there were] so many difficulties they had to undergo to get the most valuable jewels.\n\tIn the same way, there are so many valuable jewels [in the form] of realizations that Prabhupada has actually impregnated into his commentaries on Srimad-Bhagavatam and Caitanya Caritamrita. If you want to mine those jewels and actually appreciate how precious they are, you have to be willing to undergo some austerity to get to them. And here Prabhupada is explaining in this commentary the type of austerities one has to be prepared to undergo to become free from the repetition of birth and death. He also describes here [what we have to do] to become free from material desires, which is our primary objective in participating in the Krishna consciousness movement; [he describes] how to purify the heart.\n\tCeto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam. We are cleansing the heart by the process of sankirtana yajna. (Sri Siksastakam, text 1)\n\tPrabhupada quotes the verse, tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam. (SB 5.5.1) By such austerities, one\u2019s heart becomes purified. And then one can achieve a special type of happiness, spiritual happiness, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.\n\tPrabhupada emphasized during those early years: \u201cHere is the way you can extract the jewels from my books. Yes, every day you must read from my books.\u201d And he emphasized that definitely these books were not only for distribution but also for his disciples to read. So he wanted that in the morning and in the evening we read his books, and then the rest of the day we go out and distribute his books so that we can become qualified to mine all the jewels. The point is that austerity is required.\n\tPrabhupada used to emphasize that an easy-going life and Krishna consciousness don\u2019t go well together. In fact, there is a verse in the Second Canto of the Bhagavatam in which the Lord is speaking to Brahma. He says:\n\tpratyadistam maya tatra\n\ttvayi karma-vimohite\n\ttapo me hrdayam saksad\n\tatmaham tapaso \u2019nagha\n\t\u201cO sinless Brahma, you may know from Me that it was I who first ordered you to undergo penance when you were perplexed in your duty. Such penance is My heart and soul, and therefore penance and I are nondifferent.\u201d (SB 2.9.23)\n\tIn the purport, Prabhupada says, \u201cThe penance by which one can see the Personality of Godhead face to face is to be understood as devotional service to the Lord and nothing else because only by discharging devotional service in transcendental love can one approach the Lord. Such penance is the internal potency of the Lord and is non-different from Him. Such acts of internal potency are exhibited by nonattachment for material enjoyment.\u201d\n\tThen he goes on to explain about the importance of penance and how penance includes knowledge and detachment. He says, \u201cOne cannot enjoy material illusory prosperity if he desires to return home, back to Godhead. One who has no information of the transcendental bliss in the association of the Lord foolishly desires to enjoy this temporary material happiness.\u201d\n\tThen in the next verse Krishna says to Brahma, \u201cI create this cosmos by penance, I maintain it by the same energy, and I withdraw it all by the same energy. Therefore the potential power is penance only.\u201d (SB 2.9.24)\n\tPrabhupada says in the commentary, \u201cIn executing penance, one must be determined to return home, back to Godhead, and must decide to undergo all types of tribulations for that end. Even for material prosperity, name and fame, one has to undergo severe types of penance, otherwise no one can become an important figure in this material world. Why, then, are there severe types of penance for the perfection of devotional service?\u201d\n\tAnd the answer?\n\t\u201cAn easygoing life and attainment of perfection in transcendental realization cannot go together. The Lord is more clever than any living entity; therefore He wants to see how painstaking the devotee is in devotional service. The order is received from the Lord, either directly or through the bona fide spiritual master, and to execute that order, however painstaking, is the severe type of penance. One who follows the principle rigidly is sure to achieve success in attaining the Lord\u2019s mercy.\u201d\n\tThis is where Prabhupada says, \u201cAn easygoing life and attainment of perfection in transcendental realization cannot go together.\u201d\n\tAs Prabhupada said in the first verse we read today, the hard labor involved in preaching to atheistic men and distributing literature is of course an austerity. And one has to be prepared to accept this type of austerity no matter how painstaking it may be. The nature of these austerities is that in the beginning they are very bitter. But if one is willing to painstakingly continue to perform the austerities, they become very sweet.\n\tAnyone who has ever voluntarily undergone the austerity of going out and distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books all day must have some realization of this. It will come. It has to come. I remember, as I\u2019ve said many times before\u2026I don\u2019t want to tell so many stories, but I remember when distributing books, we would be out at nine o\u2019clock in the morning and finish at ten o\u2019clock at night. And on weekends, on Saturday night, we would stay out until one or two o\u2019clock in the morning. We didn\u2019t do this all the time, but definitely during the marathon. But then, because of the marathon, that experience was so sweet that many devotees started to voluntarily embrace the marathon mood more frequently throughout the year. That\u2019s the nature of the experience.\n\tIt\u2019s just like devotees who have taken a vow to chant sixty-four rounds during certain times. In the beginning, it\u2019s very hard. Because you\u2019re thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this four times more than I usually do it. I haven\u2019t even finished sixteen rounds yet.\u201d In the beginning there is all kinds of resistance. Your mind is fighting, and then, as you continue to chant, the next set of sixteen rounds is still a little bit difficult. Then you start chanting the next set of sixteen rounds, and you\u2019re starting to get a little bit over the hurdle; you\u2019re starting to realize that actually sixty-four rounds is achievable. And then, when you start chanting the last rounds, you\u2019re starting to say, \u201cDo I want to stop at sixty-four? Why should I stop? Is there any reason to stop? I could chant more, couldn\u2019t I? Then why not?\u201d You\u2019re willing to voluntarily undergo the commitment, to undergo the austerity no matter how difficult it may be. That\u2019s the nature of austerity. In the beginning it\u2019s bitter, but at the end it\u2019s very sweet. When you actually get a taste for austerity, you can\u2019t imagine living without it because, as Prabhupada says, an easy-going life and Krishna consciousness just don\u2019t go together! But the taste comes when we voluntarily do it. That\u2019s when you really start to experience upliftment, enlightenment.\n\tOf course the taste is not always there. Those of you who have heard me tell stories of my first two years of book distribution know what I went through. I\u2019ve told how the first two years of distributing Prabhupada\u2019s books were just misery from morning to night. I very clearly remember not wanting to fall asleep at night because the morning would come too quickly. And I knew that once the morning came it would be full force \u2013 I\u2019d be right out on book distribution again in no time.\n\tThose realizations\u2026Ladvamsi, came to me when\u2026[To Ladvamsi Prabhu:] Did you ever go to\u2026When we had that book distribution center in New Haven, did you ever distribute from there? New Haven? Once or twice. Do you remember?\n\tWe had a small apartment we rented for distributing books somewhere away from the Boston temple. The apartment was mainly used as a warehouse for keeping our books. It was so full of books there was hardly even room to move around. The only way we had hope of moving around was to distribute books. It was the same thing we did with the vans; we\u2019d load them up to the top so that the first night after we left there would be no place to sleep! If we wanted to sleep in the van, we had to distribute books.\n\tI remember this particular place we had, this preaching...It wasn\u2019t a preaching center. It was like a base for distributing books. I remember lying awake at night because I had so much anxiety over having to wake up so quickly. I was feeling that the only way I could rest my mind from having to be fully engaged all day long in book distribution was to lie awake at night and look at the ceiling. I preferred that to sleeping. Sleeping just went too fast. But if I stayed awake all night, at least I could count the minutes. It was very difficult. But in due course of time, somehow, I\u2019m not going to tell the whole story, but somehow Krishna and Prabhupada revealed some taste. Anybody who has been willing to painstakingly undergo the austerity of going out and introducing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books to the conditioned souls has had their own circumstances and their own realizations.\n\tBut, generally, the experience was in the beginning of the day very difficult, especially because breakfast was, generally, our only meal of the day. Lunch was peanuts and raisins. But breakfast was our only meal, so we would eat enough to have energy for the whole day. When we\u2019d step outside to start distributing books, our legs would buckle. We had to burn that off, just to be able to move. Those first hours were really difficult. And then when you get to about eleven or twelve o\u2019clock, then you\u2019re finally able to start moving a little bit.\n\tYou may not know this, but Ladvamsi Prabhu was the acarya. Ladvamsi never walked on book distribution. He always ran from one person to the next. Always.\n\t[To Ladvamsi Prabhu:] I remember when you were travelling with me, you said you had to run.\n\tHe would be the first to burn it off. We were distributing in big parking lots. In the early morning hours, there weren\u2019t many people. Usually it was just some housewives coming to buy a few things at the store. To go from one person to the next, you had to run to get to the next person before they got into the car and drove away. So Ladvamsi Prabhu was always running. Always. I remember. He would be the first to burn off breakfast. He would sometimes get pretty hungry in the day because he was burning it off so quickly.\n\tAround noon, one o\u2019clock, you were able to move a little bit better because you had burnt off the breakfast. But still it was difficult, because we knew we had to go until nine o\u2019clock, ten o\u2019clock at night. Although we had already been distributing for four hours, there was still another eight hours to go. We\u2019d stop in the afternoon and read a little, take our peanuts and raisins and then go out and distribute for the evening. I remember so many times\u2026Once the evening started, a lot more people were out, and more books were going out, and of course there were more difficulties too, because there was more resistance from people. There were more people to insult us and to attack our false egos. But by the end of the day we didn\u2019t want to stop. We just wanted to keep on going. There was a certain realization that if you\u2019re willing to stick it out and undergo the austerity, there\u2019s some nectar at the end. \n\tOf course that nectar is gaining the taste for some austerity, some personal inconvenience. And when you gain that taste for austerity, then the process Prabhupada gave us of nourishment, of rejuvenating ourselves every day by reading from his books, brought his books to life. Srimad-Bhagavatam was living, a living experience every day. Many times it would happen, when it was really difficult in the day, and you\u2019re thinking, \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d you sit down and open up a book. And there it is, right where you opened the book. Prabhupada is saying the exact words you need to hear. Exactly. It\u2019s almost like you said, \u201cPrabhupada, what should I do now?\u201d And you open up the book, and Prabhupada\u2019s voice is right there, giving you the answer. Prabhupada wrote these books for us and also for distributing. He was so much feeling the pulse during his manifest presence that if you read his books in a very systematic way, you\u2019ll see his commentaries were also very systematic, delivering exactly what we needed as we were progressing in the performance of these austerities.\n\tThe real foundation for distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books is the love we feel for what he\u2019s given to us in those books. When we go back and read his commentaries and see how he was able to perfectly make devotional service accessible to everyone in all walks of life at all levels of advancement\u2026Through his commentaries, Srila Prabhupada brought Srimad-Bhagavatam to life. And if we want to live, we have to associate with him in his books. When we associate with him in his books, we\u2019ll begin to realize how wonderful it is to give those books to somebody else. This book changed my life. You can tell somebody, \u201cI was on a course to hell; this book changed my life.\u201d\n\tI remember when one time devotees were distributing books\u2026It wasn\u2019t in America; devotees in Europe started this method of distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books. They published Prabhupada\u2019s books with very, very beautiful covers. They would distribute these books to people at intersections, while they were in their cars waiting for the light to change. You don\u2019t have much time. They would give the books to people in their cars. They would put the book through the window and they would say, \u201cWe want you to have this book.\u201d And the people would ask, \u201cHow much does it cost?\u201d And the devotees would say, \u201cActually, now that I think about it, it\u2019s priceless. It\u2019s worth so much you could never afford it. Maybe I should take it back.\u201d It was really quick. And the people would say, \u201cNo, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let me look at that book.\u201d \u201cYou could never give enough money for it.\u201d \u201cWell, how much do you want?\u201d \u201cSorry\u2026I\u2026It\u2019s just\u2026You could never give enough.\u201d And they\u2019d say, \u201cWell, is ten dollars enough?\u201d Because they\u2019d look at the book \u2013 the books were beautiful. Of course it wasn\u2019t dollars, it was in European countries, so it was according to their currency at the time. But that\u2019s how the devotees actually presented the book: \u201cActually, this is too valuable. I don\u2019t think you have enough money to pay for it.\u201d And people would buy them. We have to be convinced that actually these books are too valuable. They\u2019re priceless. Of course, there so many methods we can adopt for introducing these books to others.\n\tI\u2019ve said this many times, and I speak about it on occasions like this, because personally I feel that there are some devotees who have never had this experience. And I honestly feel so sorry for them, because personally I feel that \u2013 after what I went through in distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, the austerities I had to undergo, and the connection I felt with Srila Prabhupada by undergoing those austerities \u2013 knowing now what I went through, if I had come to Krishna consciousness and never distributed books, I don\u2019t know how I could have ever felt I wasn\u2019t cheated.\n\tBut we should never feel cheated:\n\ttiraskrta vipralabdhah\n\tsaptah ksipta hata api\n\t\u201cDevotees of the lord are so forbearing that even if they are cheated, cursed, neglected, disturbed or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves.\u201d (SB 1.18.48)\n\tPrabhupada said that everybody should know the art of distributing his books. You just have to get this experience, somehow. When you have to associate with the non-devotees in this way, through this medium, and you experience what it does to your false ego, you\u2019ll embrace the devotees every night you come back from book distribution. You\u2019ll be so grateful to have the opportunity to associate with the devotees. I\u2019ve had beer bottles thrown at me, beer poured on me. I\u2019ve been spit on. I\u2019ve been kicked, insulted. There have been so many different nectarean experiences. And you wonder, \u201cHow can I go on doing this?\u201d\n\tBut then you begin to realize that the reward is to be back in the association of devotees. That\u2019s the reward. After being out for ten, twelve hours\u2026Of course, sometimes you meet wonderful people too. But they\u2019re not as numerous as the others. So when you come back to the association of devotees you just fall at their feet and embrace them. You can only love them!\n\tThis is how Prabhupada brought us up in Krishna consciousness. This is his greatest gift, the greatest benediction he gave to us, his followers. Everybody should experience it. Just take a stack of books, and don\u2019t come back until they\u2019re distributed. Undergo some austerity. Take some vow: \u201cI won\u2019t come back until these books are distributed.\u201d Of course, for myself, that was my service. Every day that was my service to go out and distribute Prabhupada\u2019s books.\n\tBut I definitely remember that \u2013 although book distribution was so difficult for me for the first couple of years \u2013 what really gave me incentive to keep trying was the personal conviction that Prabhupada\u2019s Bhagavad-gita had rescued me. I felt I had a debt. I had a debt to repay to Prabhupada.\n\tI had a debt because he underwent the hard labor, he underwent the austerities himself. And he says that the hard labor involved in preaching, in preparing literature, in preaching to atheistic men, in distributing literature door to door\u2026Prabhupada used to distribute Back to Godhead door to door. He\u2019d write the articles himself. He\u2019d go out, get the money for paper, and sometimes he\u2019d go into debt. He wouldn\u2019t be able to pay the printer for paper. Prabhupada had to appeal to the printer to continue printing it. He had to promise he would get sufficient funds back from selling the magazines to cover the costs. Every new publication, Prabhupada would carry it on his bicycle and go from one tea stall to the next, personally going out and introducing his Back to Godhead magazine and collecting donations so he could pay the printer. And he was also living in very difficult conditions at that time. He took up the austerity.\n\tAnd his austerities bore fruit. He would oftentimes look at the devotees sitting in front of him and say, \u201cThis is the fruit that my Guru Maharaja has given. Because he gave me the order to print books, he\u2019s personally sent all of you to assist him.\u201d We should be willing to take up some austerity and assist Srila Prabhupada in giving this message to others.\n\tI\u2019m sorry, I spoke a little bit longer than expected\u2026But this day is an opportunity for us to hear these important instructions that Srila Prabhupada has given and the realizations Srila Prabhupada has blessed us with. This is something that will carry us throughout our whole life and give us strength to continue to undergo whatever austerities will come to us in the future. Maybe we won\u2019t be distributing books our whole life, but there will be new austerities to face. Sometimes even just staying in the association of devotees may seem like an austerity. But because we\u2019ll have the taste for austerities that Srila Prabhupada gave us in the foundational years of our Krishna consciousness, we will be able to continue to undergo whatever austerities are necessary to never leave Srila Prabhupada\u2019s lotus feet, to never leave Srila Prabhupada\u2019s mission, and to give our lives in service to him.\n\tThat much gratitude we must have. If we want that, we have to base our lives on Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books. Don\u2019t cheat yourselves. Read Prabhupada\u2019s books. They are our life. Thank you.\n","nid":"8318"},{

Kardama Muni practiced mystic yoga meditation for ten thousand years just to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari. Therefore, whether one practices yoga or speculates and does research to find God, one's efforts must be mixed with the process of devotion. Without devotion, nothing can be perfect. The target of perfection and realization is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that one who constantly engages in Krsna consciousness is the topmost yogi. The Personality of Godhead, Hari, also fulfills the desires of His surrendered devotee. One has to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Hari, or Krsna, in order to achieve real success. Devotional service, or engagement in Krsna consciousness, is the direct method, and all other methods, although recommended, are indirect. In this age of Kali the direct method is especially more feasible than the indirect because people are short-living, their intelligence is poor, and they are poverty-stricken and embarrassed by so many miserable disturbances. Lord Caitanya, therefore, has given the greatest boon: in this age one simply has to chant the holy name of God to attain perfection in spiritual life.\nThe words samprapede harim mean that in various ways Kardama Muni satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, by his devotional service. Devotional service is also expressed by the word kriya-yogena. Kardama Muni not only meditated but also engaged in devotional service; to attain perfection in yoga practice or meditation, one must act in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. Remembering is meditation also. But who is to be remembered? One should remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not only must one remember the Supreme Person; one must hear about the activities of the Lord and chant His glories. This information is in the authoritative scriptures. After engaging himself for ten thousand years in performing different types of devotional service, Kardama Muni attained the perfection of meditation, but that is not possible in this age of Kali, wherein it is very difficult to live for as much as one hundred years. At the present moment, who will be successful in the rigid performance of the many yoga rules and regulations? Moreover, perfection is attained only by those who are surrendered souls. Where there is no mention of the Personality of Godhead, where is there surrender? And where there is no meditation upon the Personality of Godhead, where is the yoga practice? Unfortunately, people in this age, especially persons who are of a demoniac nature, want to be cheated. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends great cheaters who mislead them in the name of yoga and render their lives useless and doomed. In Bhagavad-gita, therefore, it is clearly stated, in the Sixteenth Chapter, verse 17, that rascals of self-made authority, being puffed up by illegally collected money, perform yoga without following the authoritative books. They are very proud of the money they have plundered from innocent persons who wanted to be cheated.\nPurport by Niranjana Swami\nHere in this verse the sage Maitreya describes the activities Kardama Muni performed by which he was able to please the Supreme Lord. Srila Prabhupada in the commentary makes an important point that whatever activities one is performing, ultimately if one wants perfection, the Lord must be pleased. Otherwise, there cannot be real perfection in any endeavor. Therefore, the Bhagavatam also emphasizes this point - the necessity is samsiddhir hari-tosanam - the Supreme Lord Hari must be pleased. That is considered the highest perfection of life. However, it may not necessarily be such an easy task to fulfill.\nWe oftentimes quote verses which give evidence that the Lord is not always such an easy person to please. One such verse was spoken by Prahlada Maharaja where he says to his classmates, \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead is not pleased even if we perform austerities and great sacrifices; even if we become expert brahmanas or advanced in vast etiquette and learning; nor by austerity or chastity or by accepting vows. None of these activities can awaken the pleasure of the Lord. The Lord is pleased only when one has unflinching, unalloyed devotional service to Him. Without sincere devotional service everything else is simply a show.\"\nTherefore, in this verse Prahlada Maharaja is setting criteria for what pleases the Lord. Unflinching, unalloyed devotional service is what awakens the Lord's pleasure. Where does that leave us? What happens to those who do not have unflinching, unalloyed devotional service? Does that mean there can never be perfection for them? Well, in these verses about Kardama Muni, in a few places, Prabhupada also quotes the verse:\nakamah sarva-kamo vamoksa-kama udara-dhihtivrena bhakti-yogenayajeta purusam param\nWhether one is filled with material desires, whether one has no material desires, or whether one desires liberation \u2013 one who has broader intelligence must by all means worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, although one may not have unalloyed, unflinching devotional service to the Supreme Lord, if one comes in contact with the Lord by devotional service, even if rendered with some motive still impure, the Lord can purify those impurities. What's most essential is that we come in contact with the Lord and worship Him by a method which does please Him, even though we may not be purely motivated. Here we see the example of Kardama Muni. He performed meditation for ten thousand years in order to propitiate the Supreme Lord.\nIn the commentary and elsewhere Prabhupada mentions that the Lord was undoubtedly pleased by his efforts. Therefore, the Lord was inclined to bestow upon Kardama Muni the benediction which he desired.\nOf course, someone may say that Kardama Muni had an impure desire. He worshiped the Lord in order to achieve a wife of like disposition. Srila Jiva Gosvami makes a very important point in relationship to this verse his Bhakti Sandarbha, in Anucheda 225. He said that it may appear that Kardama Muni was pushed by some material desire in his efforts to please the Lord, however Kardama Muni was niskama. Niskama means \u2013 no material desires. His primary interest was simply to serve the instructions given to him by Lord Brahma. Although it is not described here in this verse, but Jiva Gosvami says, the evidence of this is that when the Lord appeared and saw Kardama Muni, the Lord had tears in his eyes as he was beholding Kardama Muni in His presence. This was evidence that the Lord was certainly pleased.\nSo niskama means desireless. Krsna-bhakta\u2014niskama, ata eva 'santa' \u2013 the devotee of Krishna is niskama \u2013 he has no material desires. Prabhupada explains that by executing the instruction that was given to him by Lord Brahma, he performed different types of devotional service including meditation upon the Supreme Lord in order to satisfy Him.\nThe goal of one\u2019s sadhana is to awaken the pleasure of the Lord. For Kardama Muni it took ten thousand years. That is a lot of time. It seems that somebody has to be a very patient if he wants to awaken the Lord\u2019s pleasure. He has to be prepared to wait for ten thousand years before the Lord appears before him even to recognize that He is satisfied. The goal of his meditation was to awaken the pleasure of the Lord and see the Lord, by which he could then submit a request to the Lord. The Lord came and asked, \u201cWhat do you want from Me, Kardama?\u201d Kardama Muni glorified the Lord with prayers and then he revealed what he wanted to ask the Lord.\nOf course, Kardama Muni is one of the sons of Lord Brahma and Lord Brahma had requested him to procreate. So, Kardama Muni wanted to have a suitable wife with whom he could fulfill the service and instructions given to him. Therefore, the Lord said, \u201cYes, I will give you a suitable wife. In two days from now Svayambhuva Manu will come and he will give his daughter in marriage to you.\u201d After receiving this benediction Kardama Muni also asked, \u201cCan I leave home and enter the forest after I\u2019ve finished my duties?\u201d He was always in a renounced temperament; he never did it for personal enjoyment. That is the symptom of his being a niskama devotee. He had no personal motivation. His primary interest was to please the Supreme Lord and to awaken the Lord\u2019s pleasure.\nFor Kardama Muni that took ten thousand years. Prabhupada explains that the perfection of one\u2019s meditation is that the Lord will personally appear before the devotee. But, as we explained, it seems as though ten thousand years is a very, very long time to wait to awaken the Lord's pleasure.\nWe have been reading a very interesting topic in this connection, and it is closely connected to this commentary. Srila Prabhupada says, \u201csamprapede harim\" which means that in various ways Kardama Muni satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, by his devotional service.\u201d\nSrila Bhaktivinoda Thakura also explains in his \u201cSri Bhaktyaloka\u201d, \u201cThose who engage in sadhana desire to attain results. Karmis hope to attain heavenly happiness by fruitive activities, jnanis hope to attain liberation by speculative knowledge, and devotees hope to please Krsna by their devotion.\u201d This is the goal the devotee wants. The goal is, somehow or other, to awaken the Lord\u2019s pleasure and to obtain His mercy.\nBut, as indicated in the verse we quoted by Prahlada Maharaja, that is not so easy. He says, even if we perform great sacrifices, even if we perform severe austerities, even if we are advanced in etiquette and vast learning, if we accept vows, or are chaste, these activities in of themselves won\u2019t awaken Krsna\u2019s pleasure. What awakens Krsna\u2019s pleasure? The intent to please Him. Krsna says, \u201cAll that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer or give away, as well all austerities you perform, do it for Me!\u201d The intention is to please Him.\nSo, akamah sarva-kamo va moksa-kama udara-dhih - even though one still may have material desires or is desiring liberation\u2026 If one desires liberation \u2013 that is not intended to please the Lord. The desire to attain relief is not going to awaken the pleasure of the Lord. Nonetheless, even though one may have some impure motive, as Prabhupada says, \"Whether one practices yoga or does research to find God, one\u2019s efforts must be mixed with the process of devotion.\u201d There must be some devotion mixed in if one wants to achieve the perfection of his sadhana.\nJust like Dhruva Maharaja wanted to see the Supreme Lord, and he was given instructions by Narada Muni how he could achieve that goal. But he also wanted a kingdom. It is not that he was purely motivated to see the Supreme Lord. He was motivated by the desire for a kingdom. But he was told by Narada and also by his mother, who was his siksa-guru, \"You have to go and get the fulfillment of your desire from the Lord.\" So, following the instructions of his spiritual master, Narada Muni, Dhruva was able to achieve the darshan of the Lord. He became purified in heart and the Lord appeared before him. Dhruva realized, \u201cI came here looking for a piece of broken glass but instead I found a most valuable jewel.\u201d\nSo, because he strictly followed the instructions by which he could achieve the darshan of the Supreme Lord, Dhruva Maharaja became purified. The Lord appeared before him and said, \u201cOk, what do you want?\u201d Dhruva became so embarrassed. With a purified heart he realized, \u201cI was a fool. I\u2019ve come here before you thinking, \u2018I want a kingdom,\u2019 but now that I have seen You, why should I think about a kingdom?\u201d Dhruva was so determined in the execution of his sadhana.\nSimilarly, Kardama Muni was very determined in the execution of his sadhana\u2014his meditation for ten thousand years. The goal of those who are practitioners of bhakti yoga, as Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, is that \u201csome day, somehow or other, the Lord will become pleased by my devotion.\" If the Lord becomes pleased by our devotion, then nothing else is required.\nThere is a verse in the Bhagavatam which explains that even though a devotee has some material desires within his heart, he knows that sense gratification leads to sufferings. In the Eleventh Canto it is said, \u201cHaving awakened faith in hearing about the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being disgusted with sense gratification and knowing that sense gratification or the fulfillment of my material desires will always lead to suffering, but still not being able to give it up...\u201d He knows, it is going to lead to suffering, he is disgusted with it, but he still can\u2019t give up that desire.\nTherefore, the Lord says that the devotee should continue to worship Him with faith and devotion and he should remain happy in the execution of his prescribed duties. Because, even though the devotee knows that sense gratifications leads to suffering, a devotee sincerely repents for having such desires.\nGenerally we see from the examples in sastra, that one characteristic a devotee displays when he comes before the Lord is that he repents for his past desires. \u201cI have been so foolish; I had these desires in my heart. Please forgive me.\u201d If a devotee sincerely repents, it means that he is ready to accept that suffering voluntarily.\nRepentance means the voluntary acceptance of suffering. It is the opposite of justification. If I justify my past behavior, I don't have to feel bad about what I did. I can then go ahead and do it again. But a devotee is one who sincerely repents. He is ready to accept Krsna\u2019s decision for his suffering. That is a sincere repentance.\nSomeone may say, \u201cWell, how can one be happy? (Krsna says, \u201cRemain happy\u201d), if he knows he is going to suffer.\u201d A devotee knows \u2013 sense gratification leads to suffering. He knows it. He is disgusted by it. Still he can\u2019t give it up. But, Krsna says, \u201cBe happy.\u201d How can I be happy if I know I am going to suffer?\nA devotee remains happy because he has awakened his faith in the instructions and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. That is the criteria that Krsna gives at the very beginning of the verse we just quoted, \u201cHaving awakened faith in hearing the narrations of My pastimes, being disgusted with sense gratification, knowing that it leads to suffering, but still he can\u2019t give it up.\u201d\nWhat is the symptom that a devotee has awakened his faith? He continues to hear the glories of the Lord. He knows that by hearing all impurities within his heart will gradually become destroyed and loving devotional service to the transcendental Lord will become established as an irrevocable fact. nas\u1e6da-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya \u2013 by regularly hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam and serving the pure devotee all that is troublesome to the heart becomes destroyed.\nSo the devotee does not try to justify, \u201cYes, let me feel good about myself.\" Instead he sincerely repents. By that voluntary repentance the Lord becomes pleased. This is one symptom of a devotee who is trying to please the Lord.\nWe often quote the verses from Caitanya Caritamrita, \u201cWhen My devotee engages in My devotional service but at the same time wants the opulence of material enjoyment, he is like a fool who willingly drinks poison and gives up nectar. Why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take shelter at My lotus feet and make Him forget these pursuits.\u201d When a devotee engages in the Lord\u2019s service and at the same time wants the fulfillment of his desires, the Lord, who is the ultimate benefactor to His devotee, who is always thinking of the best interests of His devotee, will fulfill his desires in such a way that the devotee won\u2019t come back to ask for it again. What does that mean? It means that the devotee learned that he is not going to find the happiness he previously expected by getting the fulfillment of that desire. He now knows that it will eventually lead to suffering.\nFor instance, Citraketu Maharaja - he wanted a son. He tried so hard to get a son and no wife could produce one for him. We all know this story. Finally, he performed a sacrifice and received the fruit of the sacrifice by which one of his wives could produce a son for him. This wife was able to give birth to a son who was named Harshashoka \u2013 the source of all happiness and distress. When Citraketu Maharaja finally received a son, he was so happy. The news resounded throughout the kingdom that the King received a son.\nBut as we know, the queen's envious co-wives were thinking, \u201cThis one queen is now getting all the attention from the King because she was able to produce a son for him.\u201d Out of envy, they poisoned his son. Although the son had been a source of great happiness, he then became a source of great distress. The living entity within the son\u2019s body was then called back by Narada Muni to enlighten Citraketu Maharaja by awakening him to his real identity.\nThe point is that a devotee knows that attachment to temporary objects will lead to suffering. We previously referred to a Srimad Bhagavatam verse which says that the Lord fulfills the desire of His devotee in such a way that His devotee will not come back and ask for it again.\nsatyam disaty arthitam arthito nrnamnaivartha-do yat punar arthita yatahsvayam vidhatte bhajatam anicchatamiccha-pidhanam nija-pada-pallavam\n\"Whenever Krsna is requested to fulfill one's desire, He undoubtedly does so, but He does not award anything which, after being enjoyed, will cause one to petition Him again and again to fulfill further desires. When one has other desires but engages in the Lord's service, Krsna forcibly gives one shelter at His lotus feet, where one will forget all other desires. (SB 5.19.7 quoted in CC Madhya 22.40) \nThat is the difference between a benediction given by the Lord and a benediction from the demigods. The Lord is always thinking of the ultimate interest of those who worship Him, whereas the demigods may give some boon but are not thinking about the ultimate interest of the worshiper. The ultimate interest for the devotee, is to be brought closer to the Lord. Then what happens? The devotee\u2019s heart becomes purified.\nYasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih. \u201cWhen the Lord is merciful toward His devotee, He will take everything away from His devotee so that the devotee will have nothing left except Krsna.\u201d That is the real mercy of the Lord. The Lord brings His devotee closer to Him. That is the symptom that the Lord is pleased by the devotee.\nBhaktivinoda Thakura is saying here that the goal of the devotee is to please Krsna by his devotion. Karmis want the heavenly happiness; jnanis hope for liberation by speculative knowledge; but devotees want Krsna\u2019s pleasure.\nBhaktivinoda Thakura then says, \u201cBeing impatient due to prolonged sadhana some people fall from the path to the ultimate goal. Therefore, a practicing devotee, who desires to achieve his goal, attains that result only when he becomes patient. What is the symptom of his patience? \u2018Krsna must be merciful to me either today, or after one hundred years, or in some other birth. I will take shelter of His lotus feet with determination and never leave.\u2019 This type of patience is most desirable for the practitioners of the devotional service.\u201d\nPatience\u2026 One has to be patient in the execution of his devotional service. What is the symptom of this patience? Now, a hundred years from now, or in some other future birth. Kardama Muni performed strict meditation for ten thousand years.\nAs we understand, that type of patience awakens the Lord's pleasure. When a devotee is impatient, he may give up sadhana. What does that mean? It means that he has lost his faith in hearing. It is hearing from Vaisnavas that has awakened his faith in the narrations of the Lord. Then, having awakened that faith, one goes on hearing even though he is suffering. That is the symptom of his patience. He goes on hearing the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnahpunya-sravana-kirtanahhrdy antah stho hy abhadranividhunoti suhrt satamSB 1.2.17\n\u201cSri Krsna, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul in the heart of the living being, cleanses desires for material enjoyment within the heart of that person who develops the urge to go on hearing.\u201d He develops that urge, \u201cI have to continue to hear the glories of the Supreme Lord.\u201d He doesn\u2019t give it up. He goes on hearing and chanting.\nSometimes we see persons who, due to prolonged sadhana, become impatient and give it up. That is what Bhaktivinoda Thakura is saying, \u201cBeing impatient due to prolonged sadhana some people fall from the path.\u201d They are not patient. They set the time frame\u2014 when Krsna should give His mercy. \u201cKrsna, can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m suffering? Now is the time. Now is the time to free me from my suffering.\u201d When suffering is not ending, then they say, \u201cKrsna? What kind of a God is He? Can't He see that I\u2019m suffering now.\u201d\nThat is the same thing that Durvasa Muni said to the Supreme Lord. When he approached the Supreme Lord for shelter, he said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m suffering. This Sudarsana Cakra is chasing me. You are the Supreme Lord, You are independent. Certainly, when You see somebody suffering, in Your heart You must feel pain for them! I have come to You! Who else can I go to? I am coming to You! You are the Supreme! Look at me - I\u2019m suffering!\u201d\nWhat did the Lord say? \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d - \u201cWhat do You mean, You can\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d The Lord says, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do anything about your suffering. I don\u2019t have a mind to think about your suffering. I don\u2019t have a heart to think about your suffering.\u201d Why? Because Durvasa Muni offended Maharaja Ambarisa. He told Durvasa Muni, \u201cYou want me to think about your suffering, but how can I think about it, if I do not have a mind and a heart? Maharaja Ambarisa has it. He has My mind and My heart.\u201d\nTherefore the Lord explains in the Bhagavatam, \u201cMy devotees are always thinking about Me, and I am always thinking about My devotees. The devotees don\u2019t know anyone but Me, and I don\u2019t know anyone but them.\u201d Where is the Lord's attention? The Lord's attention is upon his unalloyed devotees, because according to Prahlada Maharaja, without unflinching unalloyed devotional service the Lord can\u2019t be pleased.\nTherefore, in order to clean my heart I have to go on hearing from those devotees who give the message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead without any material motive.\nnaham tis\u1e6dhami vaikun\u1e6dhe\u2028yoginam hrdayesu va\u2028tatra tis\u1e6dhami narada\u2028yatra gayanti mad-bhaktah\nKrsna says, \u201cI\u2019m not in the Vaikuntha planets, nor I am found in the hearts of yogis. If you want to find Me, personally, go where My devotees are chanting My glories, because that\u2019s where I am. That is where all your desires will be fulfilled.\u201d\nIn the Bhagavatam Narada Muni gives an instruction to the king Pracinabarhisat. \u201cIn the place, where pure devotees live, following rules and regulations, in that place if one gets a chance to hear the flow of nectar, which is flowing like the waves of the river, one will forget all the necessities of life, such as hunger and thirst, and become free from all kinds of illusion, lamentation and fear.\u201d That is the benefit gained from hearing. Instead of justifying one's past misdeeds, a devotee repents, goes on hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord, and continues to serve Him.\nBy following that sadhana and by remaining patient, always expecting that the mercy of the Lord will come when He chooses to give it, whether it comes now, a hundred years from now or in some other birth, I will go on hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, and I will never leave this service. This type of patience, says Bhaktivinoda Thakura, is required for those who are practitioners of devotional service. When the devotee is willing to accept the Lord's decision for giving His mercy, and when he has strong faith in the words of the Lord, then, if He chooses, the Lord can reduce a very long time to a very short time.\nWhen Mukunda heard he was going to have to wait ten million births, he said to Srivasa, \u201cAsk the Lord, when I will see Him again?\u201d The Lord was refusing to let Mukunda come before him to give a benediction to him. He was giving benedictions to all His devotees, one by one, and Mukunda was waiting patiently to be called. He was thinking, \u201call other devotees are getting benedictions, but why He is not calling me?\" He would not come before the Lord unless he was called. So he asked the devotees, \u201cAsk the Lord, when He will see me?\u201d The devotees asked the Lord, \u201cYour dear devotee Mukunda is here. He is just nearby, waiting for You to call him.\u201d The Lord said, \u201cOh, that Mukunda! I do not want to see him. He goes and listens to impersonal philosophy from others and when he comes here, he behaves as if he is a devotee. In one hand he holds a lotus flower, and in other hand he holds a mace to beat Me. When he is with us, he is humble, but when he is with the impersonalists, it is like he's holding a mace, to beat Me\u201d\nPrabhupada makes the same point in the commentary. He says, \u201cPerfection is attained only by those who are surrendered souls. Where there is no mention of the Personality of Godhead, where is there surrender? And where there is no meditation upon the Personality of Godhead, where is the yoga practice?\u201d He is saying, \u201cHow can you surrender?\u201d To whom are you surrendering if there is no person? They make the Supreme Lord null and void, so they do not have to surrender. Surrender is to a person. If there is no Supreme Person, then I do not have to surrender.\nSo Lord Caitanya was saying to Mukunda, \u201cWhen you are with the impersonalists, it is like beating Me on the head, saying, \u2018You don\u2019t exist\u2019. Then, when you come here, you are holding a straw in your teeth.\" The Lord concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Mukunda.\u201d Mukunda heard all of this and he asked the devotees, \u201cWhen will I see Him? Will I see Him again? If I will see Him again, when will I see Him?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cHe will see Me again in ten million births.\u201d\nWhat did Mukunda hear? He heard, \u201cHe will see Me again\u201d, and that is all he cared about. He had such firm faith in the words, \u201cHe will see Me again\u201d that He didn\u2019t care for ten million births. All he knew was, \u201cHe will see me again.\u201d He began dancing in ecstasy. He was so ecstatic - \u201cI will see; I will see; I will see.\u201d Seeing the surrender of Mukunda and the faith in the Lord\u2019s words the Lord told Srivasa, \u201cTell Mukunda to come here.\u201d But Mukunda was so ecstatic, he couldn\u2019t even hear them. They called him, \u201cMukunda!\u201d - \u201cI will see; I will see\u2026\u201d They had to bring him before the Lord.\nThe Lord was so pleased because he had firm faith in His words. Mukunda was ready to wait ten million births. He had faith that he will see the Lord after ten million births. The Lord gave him a benediction, \u201cMukunda, you will come with Me whenever I appear in this world, and you will sing for Me.\u201d Ten million births were reduced to a few moments.\nThat is nice, isn\u2019t it, but look what it takes! Be prepared to wait ten million births. In other words, be patient in executing your sadhana. Go on hearing the glories of the Lord, chanting the glories of the Lord, even though you may not be able to give up all sense gratification. This faith will awaken the Lord's pleasure. When the Lord is pleased He will bestow His mercy upon His devotee.\nThis is the understanding we get from this verse of the Bhagavatam. This is the example we can learn from Kardama Muni. The Lord became pleased and He appeared before Kardama Muni, who performed his meditation for ten thousand years.\nBut Prabhupada teaches, \u201cWe should not think that we can meditate for ten thousand years.\u201d Why? Because in this age the mind is always disturbed. People are short-lived, their intelligence is impure, and they are poverty-stricken and embarrassed by so many miserable disturbances. Therefore, Lord Caitanya has given us a great boon. In this age one has to simply chant the holy name of the Lord to attain perfection in the spiritual life. One must simply go on hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord and serving the devotees by hearing from them.\nsusrusoh sraddadhanasya\u2028vasudeva-katha-rucih\u2028syan mahat-sevaya viprah\u2028punya-tirtha-nisevanat\n\u201dBy serving those devotees who are free from vice, great service is done. By that service one develops an attachment for hearing and chanting about Krsna.\u201d Therefore we hear Srimad Bhagavatam, serve Srimad Bhagavatam and serve the devotees of the Lord, nityam bhagavata-sevaya. The result is that all that is within the heart, will gradually become destroyed, and loving devotional service to the transcendental Lord will become established as an irrevocable fact.\nHare Krsna.All glories to Srila Prabhupada \n","nid":"6767"},{

I will read first Sanskrit and I will read the translation and commentary by Srila Prabhupada.\nsri-bhagavan uvaca\u2028idam tu te guhyatamampravaksyamy anasuyavejnanam vijnana-sahitam\u2028yaj jnatva moksyase 'subhat\nSYNONYMS\nsri-bhagavan uvaca\u2014the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; idam\u2014this; tu\u2014but; te\u2014unto you; guhya-tamam\u2014the most confidential; pravaksyami\u2014I am speaking; anasuyave\u2014to the nonenvious; j\u0441anam\u2014knowledge; vijnana\u2014realized knowledge; sahitam\u2014with; yat\u2014which; jnatva\u2014knowing; moksyase\u2014you will be released; asubhat\u2014from this miserable material existence.\nTRANSLATION\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence.\nPURPORT by Srila Prabhupada\nAs a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the Srimad-Bhagavatam: \"The messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees. This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.\"\nThe devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord's service. The Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in Krsna consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of Krsna in the association of devotees. Discussion of Krsna is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization. Lord Krsna, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has already disclosed.\nThe very beginning of Bhagavad-Gita, the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in Krsna consciousness, they are called more confidential. But the matters, which are described in the Ninth Chapter, deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of Krsna is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated. Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-gita, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person.\nNow this first verse has specific significance. The words idam j\u0441anam (\"this knowledge\") refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, Krsna consciousness. When one's heart is thus cleared of material contamination, one can understand this science of Krsna. Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who understands that he is not the body.\nThere\u2019s still a little more in this commentary but I think I should stop here for now, because there is a lot of things are already discussed. I will try to cover that, what we have already read.\nPurport by Niranjana Swami\nom -ajnana-timirandhasyajnananjana-salakayacaksur unmilitam yenatasmai sri-gurave namah\nmukam karoti vacalampangum langhayate girimyat-krpa tam aham vande\u2028sri-gurum dina-taranam\nnama om visnu-padaya krsna-presthaya bhu-tale\u2028srimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine\nnamas te sarasvate deve gaura-vani-pracarine\u2028nirvisesa-sunyavadi-pascatya-desa-tarine\njaya sri-krsna-caitanya prabhu-nityananda\u2028sri-advaita gadadhara srivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrnda\nhare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare\u2028hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare\nFirst I should say that I am very happy to be here. Unfortunately, my visit is a lot shorter than I expected and I hope you will forgive me. I have some immigration issues that I have to deal with immediately, I cannot avoid it. I have an appointment tomorrow morning in Kiev so I have to leave today. But I feel very fortunate that I was able to come for this long and I have to confess it was because of Tarun Krsna's insistence that I didn\u2019t go directly to the airport.\nSo after that brief introduction let us talk about the verse. Yesterday we were at a gathering in Magdalinovka and we were reading one verse from Srimad Bhagavatam spoken by Prahlada Maharaja. He was praying to Lord Nrsimhadeva for all envious persons to become pacified so that they can fully absorb their minds and thoughts in the Supreme Lord and therefore generally think of the welfare of everyone else. We appreciated hearing what Prahlada Maharaja had to say as well as what Srila Prabhupada gave in his commentary. There was one word in the verse, khalah, meaning those who are envious. Srila Prabhupada in his commentary added the phrase, \u201cPractically everyone.\u201d So, when we read and discussed it yesterday, we realized that practically everyone means just that, practically everyone. There may be a few rare souls who are completely devoid of any trace of envy in their hearts. Because their hearts are completely devoid of envy of others and of the Supreme\u2026 Our original envy is directed towards the Supreme. So when a heart is completely free from all envy, as Krsna explains in this verse, \u201cI shall reciprocate with such a clean heart so that you become completely free from all material miseries.\u201d Krsna says here in this verse,\nidam tu te guhyatamampravaksyamy anasuyave\n\u201cBecause you are never envious of Me, I shall impart this most confidential knowledge and realization, by which you will become free from all miseries.\u201d (BG 9.1)\nSo, this quality of non-envy is very important to develop. Just as a person who has a particular type of disease is very eager to take the proper medicine to cure it, in the same way Krsna is explaining in this verse that if one becomes free from envy, not only will he be cured of his disease, but he will have put an end to all of his miseries forever. So sometimes, when the body is in a diseased state, one naturally becomes more overwhelmed by the immediate need to become cured from the physical disease.\nBut an intelligent person who understands the root cause of suffering in this world tries to cure the diseases at the root. Srila Prabhupada used to give the example that if the physical body is afflicted by an infection or boil, one can blow on the boil to try to temporarily mitigate the pain. But an expert physician knows that rather than to treat the symptom, one should go to the source of the problem. Therefore, he understands that there is a need to purify the blood. Or sometimes we may think about how to get relief immediately, so we may lance the boil. But if these toxins are still in the blood, the boil will appear again. Srila Prabhupada uses this analogy to help us to understand the need to look for spiritual solutions for material problems. Krsna is actually suggesting the same approach in this verse. What is He suggesting? He says, \u201cIf you can uproot this envy\u2026\u201d He says, \u201cBecause you are never envious of Me.\u201d Somebody may hear this statement and think, \u201cOh, I am not envious of Krsna.\u201d Or somebody may feel offended. \"Why is Krsna or Prabhupada or anybody else suggesting that I have envy?\" But actually it is described that this envy is the root cause of our existence in this world. Just as Lord Kapiladeva describes in the Srimad Bhagavatam,\nmad-asrayah katha mrstahsrnvanti kathayanti ca\u2028tapanti vividhas tapa\u2028naitan mad-gata-cetasah\nHe says, \u201cAlways engaged in thoughts, hearing, and chanting about Me, such a sadhu never suffers from material miseries because he is always filled with thoughts of my activities and pastimes\u2026\u201d (SB 3.25.23) And so on. In other words, a symptom of a person whose heart is completely devoid of envy is that he accepts that Krsna is the Supreme. He does not argue, he does not protest, he does not look for an excuse to think that maybe he is better than Krsna. He doesn\u2019t contest when Krsna says, \"just serve Me.\" For instance, he does not become disturbed when he hears that Krsna always enjoys. \"Krsna doesn\u2019t suffer from miseries. Why does Krsna not suffer from miseries, but I do? Why is it that Krsna doesn\u2019t have to do anything? He just enjoys. And when I try to enjoy and not do anything else but enjoy, why doesn\u2019t it work? Why can't I always enjoy? Why does Krsna always enjoy? Why does He get away with it? If I have to suffer He should suffer too.\" That\u2019s envy. Just as Krsna says, na mam karmani limpanti na me karma-phale sprha/ Krsna says, \"There is no work that affects Me. Nor do I aspire for any fruits of work.\u201d\nKrsna is self-satisfied. What does He need in this world? He doesn\u2019t need anything in this world. Certainly not any of these physical elements that are perceivable to our senses. There is not anything required by Krsna for His pleasure. Krsna is always transcendental to this material world. Therefore His enjoyment is ananda, on the spiritual platform. He derives great pleasure from associating with those who are non-envious, who want nothing from Him but to serve Him. He is the Supreme; everything in this world is already His own. \u201cI am a source of the material and spiritual world. Everything belongs to Me.\u201d\nA devotee is somebody who says, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from You. I want to be with You and to serve You because of who You are, not because of what You have or what I can get from You.\u201d If we hear about a very wealthy or famous person, we immediately think, \u201cWhy does he have all this wealth? Why does he have all that fame? He has to give something to me.\u201d Don\u2019t we think in that way? We see a very wealthy person who doesn\u2019t give anything to anybody and we become envious. So much wealth!\nIn fact just recently there was a big controversy. One of the wealthiest people in the world, the CEO of Facebook... Anybody heard that? I will not tell you who, I'll let you guess who he is. He recently got married, and while on his honeymoon he was in a restaurant and didn\u2019t give a tip to the waiter. It was big news, everybody was talking about it. They couldn\u2019t understand. This man has billions of dollars and he did not even give a tip to the waiter. \"I hear this and immediately become angry. What kind of person is this? He is simply thinking of his own enjoyment! He has so much...\" People think that way about one CEO of a small company in the material world. Imagine what they think about Krsna? Most people don\u2019t want to think about Krsna because they would become too disturbed. \u201cWho is this person who is the Supreme, who owns everything, who controls everything, and who only enjoys and doesn\u2019t have to suffer? He created this place, He put me here and I have to suffer!\u201d We become indignant. Better not to think about Him. It is too disturbing to the mind. So we may say, \u201cWell, I am not envious of Krsna.\u201d But it is hard to think of Him. Why is it so hard to think of Him? Can anybody tell me? Because usually the tendency is to think, \u201cI have to think of me. I can take care of myself. Nobody else is going to do it.\u201d\nSo someone may say, \u201cI am not envious of Krsna.\u201d But what are the symptoms of those who are not envious of Krsna? The symptoms of those who are non-envious of Krsna are their minds, thoughts, words, activities... Everything is always absorbed in Krsna. It is not because they want something from Him. Sometimes it is very difficult for a wealthy person to know who his friends are. He starts to wonder, \u201cIs this person my friend because he likes me, or because he likes my money?\u201d This is very difficult, so he might associate only with other very wealthy people. But they are envious of each other. So much envy in this world. Somebody is a little bit better than I am, somebody has a little bit more than I do, somebody gets a little more recognition than I do, gets more publicity than I do. Immediately the mind starts thinking, \u201cI am much better than that.\u201d This is envy. Envy means to become absorbed in a discontented way about somebody else who has more possessions or more qualities or even more luck than we do. As soon as somebody gets something that we want, we\u2019ll think, \u201cI deserved that, why did he get it? I will show him, I will get something better than him.\u201d Those attitudes are there in the material world.\nWhen there is envy in one\u2019s heart, it is very difficult to think of the welfare of others. Why? Because we are in need. Therefore, when I need something, as soon as I see somebody, I start thinking, \u201cWhat can I get from that person?\u201d How can I think of their welfare if I am thinking of my own needs first? But Krsna says, \u201cIf you think of Me, I will take care of all your needs.\u201d That is the symptom of a person who is not envious. He is always thinking of Krsna, he is always depending on Krsna, he is always speaking about Krsna, and he always desires to serve Krsna. Krsna says,\nman-mana bhava mad-bhaktomad-yaji mam namaskuru\n\u201cIf you always think of Me, worship Me, offer your homages unto Me, surely you will come to Me.\u201d (BG 9.34)\nAs Krsna says here in this verse, \u201cBecause you are not envious of Me, I shall impart to you all of this wisdom about Me so that you would become completely free from all material miseries.\u201d When we say, \u201cOh, Krsna is wise, He wants me to serve Him, so why is He telling me He will make me free from miseries?\u201d Krsna in many places in Bhagavad-Gita says what He gives to His devotee. He says, \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion, surrender unto Me. I will deliver you from all sinful reactions, do not fear,\u201d and, \u201cThe one who goes to my Supreme abode will never have to return to this material world again.\u201d \u201cOne who simply knows the transcendental nature of My birth and activities in this world never has to take his birth again in this world, but he attains to My supreme abode.\u201d Krsna is actually giving so many very positive indications and reinforcement that, \u201cYes, if you think of Me, serve Me, worship Me, I\u2019ll bring you to Me.\u201d Krsna even says,\nananyas cintayanto mam\u2028ye janah paryupasatetesam nityabhiyuktanamyoga-ksemam vahamy aham\n\u201cThose who meditate upon Me, on My transcendental form, worship Me, for them, whatever they have I let them keep it and, whatever they lack, I give it to them.\u201d (BG 9.22)\nSounds like a really good proposition. Krsna in so many places indicates, \u201cYes, become my devotee\u2026 To those who are always endeavoring, worship Me with love. I give them the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d\nKrsna is trying to attract us in the proper direction. The solution is to think of Krsna, to serve Him. Krsna guarantees, \u201cFor one who even explains this secret to others, devotional service is guaranteed and in the end he comes back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor ever will there be anyone more dear.\u201d (BG 18.68)\nSo Krsna guarantees that He will deliver His devotee and fulfill all his necessities of life. Here again we have to analyze what the necessities for life are. When Krsna says, \u201cI fulfill all his necessities for life,\u201d what He is saying? There are necessities for maintaining life in this body: food, clothing, shelter. But Krsna explains in Bhagavad-gita that life continues to exist beyond the body. So how can food, shelter and clothing be necessities of life? They are necessities of maintaining life in the body. But life has its own necessities. Srila Prabhupada gives the example of the bird in the birdcage. Polishing the cage is very good. If you do it every day, the cage will look very nice. But if you don\u2019t feed the bird, even if the cage looks beautiful, the bird will be dead. Necessities of life are not just those necessities which maintain our life in this body. Life has its own necessities.\nWhat are the necessities of life? How to really live to one\u2019s full capacity? How to live one\u2019s life not only to full capacity, but for eternity? Prabhupada explains this here in the commentary. He says, \u201cWhen one\u2019s heart is cleared of material contamination, one can understand this science of Krsna. Simply to understand that the living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who understands that he is not the body.\u201d In other words, it is not sufficient simply to know that one is not the body. One has to know who one is beyond the body. That connection is established when one establishes his connection with Krsna. Krsna says elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita, \u201cFor one who is not connected to the Supreme, one can have neither a controlled mind nor transcendental intelligence, without which there is no possibility of peace. How can one be happy without peace?\u201d\nKrsna very clearly explains that if you do not establish your connection with the Supreme, the mind will always be agitated and disturbed and the intelligence will not be transcendental. mayayapahrta-jnana - Krsna says, those whose intelligence is stolen by illusion. Therefore, there will be no possibility of peace. How can there be any happiness without peace? Therefore, to know who I am beyond this body is the real necessity of life. I need to establish my connection with Krsna. That is life\u2019s necessity. Until I establish my connection with Krsna, I will have to suffer in this world.\nkrsna-bhakta\u2014niskama, ata eva 'santa'\u2028bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kami, sakali 'asanta'\n(CC, Madhya 19.149)\nThe devotee of Lord Krsna is desireless and can therefore be peaceful. Those who desire bhukti, material enjoyment, those who desire mukti, liberation from suffering, those who desire siddhi, mystic yogic powers, because they are still filled with selfish desires, can never be peaceful. But a devotee has all his desires are fulfilled. How they are fulfilled? Because Krsna fulfills. Krsna makes the devotee happy in any condition of life. A devotee is so satisfied with Krsna that he does not want anything else.\nJust like Dhruva Maharaja. He was angry when he was thrown off the lap of his father, the King. His envious stepmother said to him, \u201cIf you want to sit on your father's lap, you have to take your birth again in my womb. Then you can sit on your father\u2019s lap.\u201d Dhruva was very distressed. This was his father, but it so happened that he took birth from another one of his father's queens. His envious stepmother said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t sit there. Only my children can sit on his lap.\u201d Dhruva wanted to know what he should do. He went to his mother who told him, \u201cYou should go to the forest and seek out the Supreme Lord. He can rectify everything.\u201d As we know, Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest, met Narada Muni, and was instructed by him as to how to get the Supreme Lord\u2019s darsan so he could ask the Supreme Lord for a kingdom better than his father\u2019s, grandfather\u2019s and great grandfather\u2019s - Lord Brahma. Dhruva Maharaja performed very severe austerities as a mere five-year-old boy. As a result of his austerities, he was able to obtain darsan of the Supreme Lord. But his determination was so strong because\u2026 What did he want? He wanted that kingdom. He was told that the only way he can get it is to ask the Lord directly.\nBut after his heart became purified and he established his connection with the Lord by following Narada Muni\u2019s instructions, he realized, \u201cI have come here looking for broken glass, and instead I found the most valuable jewel. I was coming to You with the intent of asking for a kingdom, but now that I have seen You and established my connection with You, I don\u2019t want a kingdom. Why should I want a kingdom? I am fully satisfied simply to serve You.\" That\u2019s the nature of the Lord. If one is very determined to attain His association, even if one has material motives in one's heart, even if one's heart is not completely freed from envy and lust, as long as one simply is determined that only the Lord can cure one's disease\u2026 This is the real medicine. Sometimes we think, \u201cOh, I have to go to a doctor and get medicine.\u201d Or we may hear, \u201cOh, Ayurveda, Ayurveda, yes, good medicine, this can cure your disease.\u201d But to get rid of that disease is only a necessity to maintain life in a body. Life has another necessity. There is a higher necessity. And that higher necessity is to establish our connection with Krsna because it is Krsna that cures the disease of the heart.\nsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnahpunya-sravana-kirtanah\n\u201cKrsna, who is the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul in the heart of all living beings, cleanses desires for material enjoyment within the heart of that person who develops the urge to hear about Him.\u201d (SB 1.2.17)\nFirst we have to recognize what our disease is. Then we have to go to a proper physician who can give the cure. Otherwise, we are simply blowing on the boil and temporarily treating the disease of the material body without understanding the disease of the heart, which is the root cause of all sufferings. Not only the sufferings of the body, but also the sufferings of the mind. Adhyatmika-klesa, adhibhautika-klesa, adhidaivika-klesa - these are the three types of sufferings that one has to be repeatedly subjected to in this material world. What about the medicine to cure the sufferings of the mind? Why is my mind so disturbed when somebody else is happy and I am not? Why is my mind so disturbed when I don\u2019t get what I want? Why is my mind is so disturbed because I can\u2019t control my life? It always seems that somebody else is controlling it. That is the disease! That\u2019s because I am in duality and I am forgetting Krsna. For one who is actually connected with Krsna, his mind is controlled and his intelligence is transcendental. He is peaceful in any condition of life.\nnarayana-parah sarvena kutascana bibhyati\u2028svargapavarga-narakesv\u2028apitulyartha-darsinah\n(SB 6.17.28)\nDevotees who are rendering service to Krsna do not fear any condition of life. Whether they are in heaven, hell, liberated \u2013 for them it is all the same. Why? Because their satisfaction, their happiness, their peace is in serving Krsna. They become so dear to Krsna that Krsna takes care of everything they need. He takes care of all their necessities of life. What is life\u2019s necessity? We need to render service to Krsna. That is life\u2019s necessity, because if we don\u2019t serve Krsna, we still have to serve. And there is only one option. There may be many different shapes, forms and opportunities, but there is only one option. The other option is, if one doesn\u2019t serve Krsna, one has to become subservient to Krsna\u2019s external energy. There are three primary energies of Krsna:\nvisnu-saktih para prokta\u2028ksetra-jnakhya tatha para\u2028avidya-karma-samjnanyatrtiya saktir isyate\n(CC, Madhya 6.154)\nThe potencies of the Lord are summarized in three categories: the spiritual energy; the living entity, who belongs to the spiritual energy but can come under the influence of the Lord\u2019s third energy, the material energy, which is visible in fruitive activities. To continue to serve the illusory energy is not a very good proposition because it only means more suffering in this material world. Therefore, life\u2019s necessity is service to Krsna.\nWhen the devotee experiences that connection of service to Krsna, his mind becomes satisfied. He is not envious of anybody else no matter what they have. He can be a true well-wisher of others. He can think of the welfare of others, because he doesn\u2019t see anything that he wants from them for himself. This is the vision of one who is in Krsna consciousness. \u201cOne who sees all living entities as spiritual sparks in quality one with the Lord becomes the true knower of things. What then can be illusion or anxiety for him?\u201d This is from Isopanisad. One sees all living entities as spiritual sparks in quality one with Krsna. He sees that everyone belongs to Krsna. Everyone should be serving Krsna. Everyone will be happy by serving Krsna. He doesn\u2019t want anything from them for himself. Let them be connected to Krsna. Let them get the real cure of their diseases. And therefore, he can be a genuine well-wisher of others. A devotee is one who, if there is any trace of envy, lust, or greed within the heart, wants to become free from these obstacles on the path of devotional service. He sees, \u201cThese are my real diseases, and I must seek out whatever medicine I can obtain to cure them. Because until I can cure that disease, I cannot help anyone else, not even myself.\u201d This is the faith. One who doesn\u2019t endeavor to establish his connection with Krsna can\u2019t even take care of himself. How can he take care of others? Therefore Krsna is instructing Arjuna in this verse:\nidam tu te guhyatamam\u2028pravaksyamy anasuyavejnanam vijnana-sahitamyaj jnatva moksyase 'subhat\n\u201cBecause you are never envious, I\u2019ll give you this most confidential knowledge about Me.\u201d Previous knowledge was partially confidential. This is the most confidential knowledge.\nWhat is most confidential? The most confidential is bhakti. It\u2019s hidden in the middle. When something is very valuable, you don\u2019t display it to everybody. You have to find it if it\u2019s hidden in the middle. So this bhakti is hidden in the middle of Bhagavad-gita. The middle chapters are elaborating on bhakti. Of course, Srila Prabhupada is so merciful, so kind, so compassionate, that in his commentaries he has put bhakti on every page. That is his mercy. He broke open the storehouse. But Krsna in his teachings to Arjuna put this most confidential knowledge right in the middle of his teachings. Therefore for those who are aspiring to obtain knowledge\u2026 There are so many kinds of knowledge, and we can give a very long list of all different kinds that one can seek. To temporarily pacify one\u2019s mind and to potentially increase one\u2019s pride is also one of the dangers of knowledge. The more I know, the more I think I\u2019m better. Therefore Prabhupada would often times quote the verse,\nbhagavad-bhakti-hinasyajatih sastram japas tapahapranasyeva dehasya\u2028man\u1e0danam loka-ranjanam\n\u201cFor a person who is devoid of devotional service, even if he is an expert in reciting all kinds of Vedic mantras, even if he can perform all kinds of austerities, even if he takes birth in a great family or nation, or if he is fully conversant in the scriptures, if he is devoid of devotional service, these are all like ornaments on a dead body. He has simply served the concocted pleasures of the general public.\u201d (Hari Bhakti Sudhodaya 3.11)\nWhat is the value of knowledge that does not lead one to the lotus feet of Krsna? Therefore, Krsna is giving us this most confidential knowledge. He is telling Arjuna right now, \u201cJust don\u2019t be envious, go on hearing about Me. There are many topics you can talk about, but those who are only interested in hearing about Me and go on endeavoring to hear about Me\u2026\u201d Krsna says, \u201cThen I will impart to you everything you need to become free from all material miseries in this world.\" That is the essence of this verse of Bhagavad-gita. Thank you very much.\nAny questions?\nQuestion: In the Bhagavad-gita, in the purport of this verse Srila Prabhupada speaks that jnana automatically means experience. Here it means of course bhakti-jnana? But what experience one does obtain in impersonal jnana?\nAnswer: What is experience obtained by jnana, impersonal knowledge?\nAs we hinted at before, by impersonal knowledge one can achieve partial realization of the Supreme, but partial realization is only one aspect at the Supreme. Krsna says, \u201cI pervade this entire cosmic manifestation through My energies.\u201d So Krsna\u2019s energies are pervasive throughout entire creation.\neka-desa-sthitasyagnerjyotsna vistarini yatha\nAs explained in Vishnu Purana, \u201cJust a sun is situated in one place but spreads its light everywhere throughout the universe, similarly Krsna is situated in the spiritual world but He is pervasive throughout the universes through His energies.\u201d Prabhupada gives the example of how a wealthy businessman may have many buildings and departments in many places throughout the country or world. He has influence on everything by his energy. You go to the plant where they build things, you go to another building where he has his offices, and you go to another plant where they do marketing. His energy spreads throughout all his places of work, his business. Still he is in one place. It is one thing to know the energies of the Supreme, but it is another thing to know the source of the energy. The impersonal aspect is simply one aspect of the Lord through the manifestation of His energy while there are higher stages of realization. In Bhagavatam first Canto there is the verse,\nvadanti tat tattva-vidastattvam yaj jnanam advayam\u2028brahmeti paramatmetibhagavan iti sabdyate\n\u201cLearned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.\u201d (SB 1.2.11) Their knowledge is knowledge of the Brahman aspect of the Lord. But Krsna clearly states in Bhagavad-gita, brahmano hi pratisthaham \u2013 \u201cI am the source of Brahman.\u201d There is a prayer in Isopanisad where the devotee prays, \u201cPlease remove that dazzling effulgence so that I can see Your form of eternity, bliss and knowledge.\u201d Smiling face. Krsna only reveals that to his devotee.\nQuestion: In this verse Krsna says that since you are not envious of Me I will reveal to you this most confidential knowledge. Does that mean that one can understand previous chapters even if he is still partially envious of Krsna?\nAnswer: Point is that even if one has envy, he can comprehend. Actually there is an interesting verse in the Bhagavad-gita, chapter 3.31,\nye me matam idam nityam\u2028anutisthanti manavahsraddhavanto 'nasuyanto\u2028mucyante te 'pi karmabhih\n\u201cThose persons who execute their duties according to My injunctions and who follow this teaching faithfully, without envy, become free from the bondage of fruitive actions.\u201d\nPrabhupada makes a very important point in the commentary. There is a lot in the whole commentary, but since we are limited in time, I will go right to the point. Prabhupada says, \u201cIn the beginning of Krsna consciousness one may not fully discharge the injunctions of the Lord. But because one is not resentful of this principal and works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely be promoted to the stage of pure Krsna consciousness.\u201d Prabhupada is saying that in the beginning he may not be completely free from envy. But if he simply follows his duties faithfully and does not become resentful that Krsna is asking him to do his duties... Just don\u2019t become resentful. \u201cOh, why do I have to do it? Krsna has no duties to perform. Why do I have duties?\u201d But Krsna even says later, \u201cAlthough I have no duties to perform, when I come, I do them, because if I didn\u2019t, others would follow my example.\u201d So Krsna performs His duties even though he doesn\u2019t have to do it. But we do. Just don\u2019t be resentful, that\u2019s all. Just be hopeful, just go on with hope. If I just go on and do my duty and I don\u2019t resent it, I have hope. Surely I would be promoted to the stage of pure Krsna consciousness, Prabhupada said. If Prabhupada said it, Krsna will keep his words true.\nQuestion: I have a request. I am requesting you as a disciple of Prabhupada. Please clean my heart from envy. I am envious of Srila Prabhupada. Therefore my mind is always restless, when I hear that Srila Prabhupada is our grandfather, that Srila Prabhupada is a position, that we are distributing books because we bring knowledge to the demons. My mind catches these ideas and holds to it. I believe sincerely that Krsna will help you to teach all those who listen to you, that Prabhupada is not grandfather, that it is not a position. He was teaching us compassion and how to distribute books. And I will associate with such people and it will save my spiritual life.\nAnswer: Well. You are half way there, because at least you know what your disease is. Most people don\u2019t know what their disease is. Therefore, they don\u2019t know what to ask Krsna for, or to ask his devotees for. Therefore they make the mistake of coming to Krsna to ask Him for some material benediction. But you are asking for a benediction to remove all your obstacles so you can serve Krsna. You have my blessings.\nHaribol.\n","nid":"6682"},{
"title":"Transcription of a Lecture Given on January 6, 2013 on the Occasion of Vyasa Puja","ref":{"target_id":"6523"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Thu, 2013-02-14 23:02","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"1","body":"The following is an edited transcription of a lecture given on January 6, 2013, on the occasion of Vyasa Puja\n \nJanuary 6, 2013 - Kiev - Vyasa Puja Lecture\nI\u2019m going to read and speak a little bit this evening from some quotes from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura and Srila Prabhupada. I was thinking about different topics I could speak on today and decided to look up some references from \"Amrta Vani\" on the topic of spiritual master. I found some interesting quotes especially one which I wanted to begin with. I\u2019ll read it and then I\u2019ll explain why I wanted to begin with it. \n\"Those who think themselves Vaisnavas are not Vaisnavas. Those who think themselves gurus or great personalities are not qualified to become gurus. Those who consider themselves disciples of a disciple are qualified to become spiritual masters. Only one who has an unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord and the spiritual master is able to act as a guru.\"(Amrita Vani)\nI thought it was appropriate, considering the references I\u2019m going to speak from tonight, to begin with this one. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura is setting guidelines in this reference and setting guidelines for the references I'll read later which describe the characteristics of a spiritual master. \nIn many of these references Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura sets the tone of the proper consciousness required to be sitting here speaking to you. Therefore, it\u2019s important for you to understand that I am not speaking about myself. I am speaking about my spiritual master, my relationship with my spiritual master and how I perceive my spiritual master.\nThe first reference is that one who thinks himself to be a guru is not qualified to be a guru and one who thinks himself to be a Vaisnava is not a Vaisnava. In fact, Srila Prabhupada once emphasized this point to a disciple. He said, \"I appreciate the poem you have written but I need to correct one small point. You refer to yourself as a Vaisnava.\" Prabupada corrected him saying that we are aspiring Vaisnavas and we should not think of ourselves as Vaisnavas. \nIn fact, even Lord Brahma, who is the head of our sampradaya, in his prayers to Lord Krsna says, \"I pray that someday You may recognize me as Your devotee.\" He was thinking, \"I\u2019m not a devotee. So please now, or in some other birth, just please consider me as someone who is Your devotee.\" \nTherefore, it is very dangerous to become proud or to be absorbed in guru abhimana. \"Guru abhimana\" means to be absorbed in the mentality of thinking oneself as guru. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta states that the person qualified to be guru is one who always thinks himself to be a disciple, at all times, in all circumstances. \nThe consciousness one must be in, while performing the service of inspiring others in Krsna consciousness, is as a disciple. This is not just something practiced. It has to become realized. It begins by practicing. But by practicing, gradually if we always force our mind to that state of consciousness, then by keeping ourselves in that state of consciousness, as a subordinate, the potency of the parampara will come through. \nIf one thinks, \"I\u2019m a guru, I\u2019m a Vaisnava, an advanced devotee,\" the mercy will not flow through. Prabhupada gives the simple example of a raincloud. When the raincloud pours water to extinguish a forest fire, the cloud does not distribute its own water\u2014it has collected the water from the ocean and then redistributes it. The water is not its own possession. It is coming from another source. He says that similarly mercy is coming from the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master doesn\u2019t think, \"This is my mercy.\" It is the mercy of the Supreme Lord which is manifested through a spiritual master who is always conscious of his subordinate position to his spiritual master or to guru-parampara. In that consciousness mercy will flow.\nTherefore, in order for that mercy to continue to flow, anyone who is a recipient of that mercy has to capture the essence of those instructions and act in the same consciousness. As the beginning of this quote states, that one should not think that he is a great Vaisnava\u2014actually not think himself as a Vaisnava, what to speak of a great Vaisnava. And those who consider themselves a disciple of a disciple are qualified to become spiritual masters. Only one who has the unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord and a spiritual master is able to act as a guru. With that introduction we are going to read other references so that you properly understand the mood in which I\u2019m presenting these instructions.\n\"However learned or thoughtful a person may be, until he takes shelter of an acarya, whose qualities personify Vaisnava philosophy, he cannot understand Vaisnavism. The Bhagavad-gita states, tad viddhi pranipatena, pariprasnena sevaya/ upadeksyanti te jnanam, jnaninas tatva-darsinah. \"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth.\" (BG 4.34)\nWe can understand the Vaisnava philosophy if we possess three specific qualities: unconditional surrender, honest inquiry and a serving temperament. The teachers of Vaisnava philosophy instruct those who approach an acarya to render these three qualities as daksina. The acaryas are not tempted by mundane daksina.\"(Amrita Vani)\nHere Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura is explaining what qualities are required to understand the Vaisnava philosophy. As we said, the topic tonight is to understand the message of guru parampara. The qualities required for understanding this message are described as three: unconditional surrender, honest inquiry and a serving temperament. \nOf course, this is in reference to the verse spoken by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita, tad viddhi pranipatena. First is unconditional surrender which is tested throughout one\u2019s life in Krsna consciousness. \nSrila Rupa Gosvami defines devotional service as free from all conditions. Until one becomes free from all conditions one cannot even come to the platform of devotional service. Devotional service of course may be mixed with other motives. But ultimately pure devotional service must be rendered. In order to achieve this state of pure devotional service, the surrender must be unconditional or free from all other conditions.\nTherefore, Krsna states in the verse tad viddhi pranipatena that one has to submissively inquire. Here that is described as \"honest inquiry.\" In other words, \"honest\" means I have to be honest about my own level of advancement in Krsna consciousness and I have to be honest about the direction I want to go in Krsna consciousness. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada oftentimes uses the word \"relevant\" in place of the word \"honest.\" Relevant inquiry means to ask questions about how to progress in spiritual life. \nAnyone who studies the conversations of Srila Prabhupada will discover that Prabhupada often dismissed questions which he considered irrelevant. He could see when devotees would ask questions born of pride. It wasn\u2019t an honest question. An honest question is asked in complete honesty, \"I want to know the answer so I can advance. I need to hear the answer so that I can overcome the obstacles I face. I need to move beyond this stage to go to the next stage, always moving towards pure devotional service.\" When inquiries are made with honesty then what happens is that one generally will get an answer which will help one and will give one strength to overcome obstacles. \nIt\u2019s interesting that in the original quote I gave, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta says that those who consider themselves disciples of a disciple are qualified to become a spiritual master. This can be taken in different ways. In other words, it can be taken that a disciple thinks himself as a disciple of the spiritual master who is also a disciple. But it can also be taken as one who submits himself to a disciple of the spiritual master and considers oneself to be disciple of a disciple. \nWe find many, many quotes that Prabhupada gave in this connection. If any of you have read the book \"Taking care of Krsna\u2019s devotees,\" you\u2019ll find that right in the beginning of the book there are many quotes Srila Prabhupada gave on how important it is for a disciple to take shelter of a senior disciple. Of course, this is the whole mood of Vaisnava philosophy\u2014gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah\u2014that the best position to be in is to place oneself as the servant of the servant of the servant. \nI also have my own personal realization and experience of this in many respects. In fact, I was speaking about this recently in a talk that I gave at the Bhakti Sangama festival, though very few devotees were present. Nonetheless, I think the talk has been transcribed. I was explaining how, during Srila Prabhupada\u2019s presence, I never got the opportunity to sit at Prabhupada's lotus feet to ask him a question. Although opportunities could have been there, by circumstances \u2026 it just never happened \u2013 ne paluchilis (Guru Maharaja is saying in Russian).\nThroughout many years I was feeling how it would have been if I would have had that opportunity. In that talk, I was explaining how one time I was sitting at the feet of a Vaisnava, a godbrother of mine, and I was listening to him explaining his own realization to me. He was quoting a reference from a book which I thought he said was Prema-vivarta though later I wasn\u2019t able to find the reference there. He was explaining how after the spiritual master departs, he can speak through the mouths of other Vaisnavas. \nSince this Vaisnava was a very elevated Vaisnava, he was speaking from realization. Even though this Vaisnava did speak to Srila Prabhupada, he was explaining how by speaking to another Vaisnava he experienced Srila Prabhupada speaking to him through this Vaisnava. As my godbrother was speaking to me about his realizations of this Vaisnava principle, I experienced Srila Prabhupada speaking to me. I saw how the mercy was flowing. I felt, \"Here is a fit conduit who is giving me the opportunity to make an honest inquiry.\" \nAlthough I\u2019ve seen Srila Prabhupada many times I never physically sat before Him to make an honest inquiry. Srila Prabhupada, by His causeless mercy, chose to speak to me through the mouth of this Vaisnava. \nTherefore, I could understand that this is the type of mentality we should have in the presence of advanced Vaisnavas. Why not consider oneself as a disciple of a disciple? Why not submit to another disciple and make an honest inquiry to them? Since that time I\u2019ve also had other experiences when I really wanted to have an answer while sitting in the presence of a godbrother, submitting myself with an open heart, honestly, and hearing Prabhupada answer my question. Prabhupada answered my prayers. This is honest inquiry which a disciple must continue throughout his devotional life.\nThis is the second quality required \u2013 first, unconditional surrender, second, honest inquiry and the third is a serving temperament. A serving temperament means that we have to think of ourselves as servants; not as masters. We have to approach everyone with this proper service attitude. In fact, there is another very nice quote which I wasn\u2019t going to speak about but since it\u2019s closely connected, I\u2019ll read it.\n\"I have not made anyone my disciple. Those who are considered my disciples by others are actually my spiritual masters. To associate with others means to accept something from them. I do not accept anything from anyone except that which I received from my spiritual master. I do not engage in any activity under anyone's order except the order of my spiritual master. We should not accept anything from anyone for ourselves. If anyone faithfully and gladly gives us something we can use to serve guru and Krsna, we should happily accept it and then use it for the Lord's service. Then we will achieve auspiciousness. If we learn the mystery of engaging everything in the Lord's service without looking at it with an enjoying spirit, we can enter the kingdom of God.\"(Amrita Vani)\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura is explaining here, \"I haven\u2019t made anyone my disciple.\" He says, \"To associate with others means to accept something from them, but I don't accept anything except that which I received from my spiritual master.\" In other words, again the consciousness is that I am not a spiritual master I haven\u2019t made anyone my disciple. \nPrabhupada would say the same point, \"My spiritual master has sent you to me. It was his desire that Krsna consciousness would spread all over the world and He sent you to assist me.\" He saw his disciples as sent to Him by his spiritual master and therefore, He considered Himself a servant of His disciples. \nHe was also completely transcendental to guru abhimana. He was always thinking how to instruct, to teach, to set an example, to encourage others to serve the higher order which had been coming down to Him through disciplic succession. \nSrila Bhaktisiddhanta states here, \"I wouldn\u2019t accept anything from anyone if my spiritual master hasn't given it to me.\" Just as Srila Prabhupada would say, \"Srila Bhaktisiddhanta sent you, my disciples, to me to give me your assistance.\" He sees us coming from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta. \"I must accept and engage you in serving Him. I should not accept anyone or anything for myself. I only accept that which I can use for the service of my spiritual master and for serving the Lord.\" \nIn the quote we read before this, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura was saying \"the teachers of Vaisnava philosophy instruct those who approach an acarya to render these three qualities as daksina. The acaryas are not tempted by a mundane daksina.\" What is the \"daksina\", real daksina that should be given? Mundane daksina, of course, can be spiritualized if it\u2019s used for the service of the spiritual master and for the service of the Lord. On that basis the disciple may accept it, but he says the acaryas instruct to render these qualities as daksina. In other words, the daksina I have to submit to my spiritual master is to manifest unconditional surrender, to continue making honest inquiries to his disciples and to have a serving temperament. That is daksina. \nJust like the story we\u2019ve been speaking about a lot lately. I won\u2019t repeat the whole story. I\u2019m sure many of you already heard it. When Govardhan Majumandara sent Raghunatha dasa to get a blessing from Haridas Thakura, Govardhan sent a cartload of opulent gifts to Haridas Thakura thinking that he would be inspired to give a nice blessing. But the namacarya, Srila Haridas Thakura, was not the least bit tempted by that daksina. Govardhan was thinking that Raghunath would get a wonderful benediction as soon as Haridasa saw all the opulent gifts. But Haridasa wasn\u2019t interested and didn't even look at them. He spontaneously gave his benediction. \"I bless you to be completely renounced from this whole material world.\" Haridas Thakur was not tempted by mundane daksina. \nWe told this story to elaborate on the point Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura makes in Sri Bhaktyaloka\u2014that it is the duty of a Vaisnava to first control himself and then he can control the whole world. Only those who can tolerate the urge to speak, the mind\u2019s demands, the actions of anger and the pushing of the tongue, belly and genitals\u2014only they will not be influenced by the temptations of this material world. Therefore, Srila Rupa Gosvami says, \"Those who tolerate these urges can make disciples all over the world.\" \nSo one who is not tempted by mundane daksina is very eager to see the daksina of honest inquiry, unconditional surrender and a serving temperament. I never got the opportunity to place daksina in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s hands\u2014although I did write him a letter and he read it. But other than that, I never placed anything in His hand. Nonetheless this was my aspiration\u2014to offer this daksina to His lotus feet. By this method of submissive inquiry, service and surrender it is my hope that the mercy which comes through Srila Prabhupada to those who have surrendered to His lotus feet will remain open to me. \nTherefore every day there is an opportunity to give daksina to the spiritual master. It's not that the quality of our surrender is determined by the amount we give him on one day a year. But it\u2019s the sacrifice and the meditation that went into the offering. It\u2019s the service attitude, the unconditional surrender behind it. These are the qualities which are the true manifestations of the offering of daksina. \n\"By taking shelter of the spiritual master\u2019s lotus feet we become fearless, free of lamentation and happy. When we serve Him, we gain his association. If we serve the spiritual master with body mind and speech, we quickly attain his mercy. When he is pleased, we\u2019ll find that our inclination to serve him progressively increases. This is the highest form of auspiciousness and the only gain.\"(Amrita Vani)\nHere is the real manifestation that should come from taking shelter of the spiritual master\u2013 to become fearless, free of lamentation and happy. This is the symptom of surrender. I often quote that verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, \"In the place where pure devotees meet, following the rules and regulations if one gets the chance to hear the descriptions of the Supreme Lord which continuously flow like the waves of a river, one will get caught up in that flow of nectar and will forget about the necessities of life such as hunger and thirst, and one will become free from all kinds of illusion, lamentation and fear.\" (SB 4.29.39-40)\nThis verse also illustrates the same point made here in this quote from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta. One who takes shelter in the process of hearing, always lends his ear in submissive inquiry to the transcendental topics which are flowing from the mouths of Vaisnavas. The result is that one forgets about the necessities of life and becomes free from illusion, fear and lamentation. This is real shelter. If one wants to achieve this shelter, one has to go on with the process of hearing. If one diminishes in some way the necessity of hearing or becomes illusioned into thinking that there are higher priorities than hearing, or if one simply goes on in forgetfulness expecting that he\u2019ll always be strong in spiritual life, the result of that neglect will be that he will not feel that happiness. One will be filled with lamentation and will be fearful about every decision one has to make in his life. That\u2019s the consequence of not hearing transcendental sound vibration. Although one may think, \"In my case I need special mercy. I don\u2019t have time to hear. I just need special mercy.\" But special mercy means developing the desire to hear. \nsusrusoh sraddadhanasya\u2028vasudeva-katha-rucih\u2028syan mahat-sevaya viprah\u2028punya-tirtha-nisevanat \n \"By serving devotees who are freed from vice great service is done. And by that service one develops an attraction for hearing.\" (SB 1.2.16)\n\"Mercy\" means developing attraction to hearing. Until I develop the attraction for hearing, I should be praying for that mercy and serving with that intention in mind. \"Let me serve so that I can develop an attraction to hear.\" Otherwise one will find that the ability to maintain that serving temperament, which is required for the proper offering of daksina, will slacken.\nSo the real test of being sheltered, genuinely sheltered, is when one feels some happiness. Even in the midst of suffering there is always hope and that hope makes one happy. Although it may be difficult to understand, but that\u2019s exactly what's stated in the eleventh canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam where Krsna says, \"Having awakened faith in the narration of My glories, being disgusted with material sense gratification and knowing that all sense gratification leads to suffering and still not being able to give it up, My devotee should continue to worship Me with faith and love and be happy. Because he knows that even though sense gratification leads to suffering, he can\u2019t give it up, but he sincerely repents for that sense gratification.\" (SB11.20.27-28) \nTherefore, he has such faith\u2014that by going on with his hearing, his suffering will lead to happiness. He voluntarily accepts it, because he has awakened faith in hearing about Krsna. \nSo even though we may feel unhappy, but because we have faith in Krsna\u2019s words, we have faith in the words of spiritual master, we have faith in the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we have faith in the potency of Krsna\u2019s Holy name, we have faith in the potency of the association of Vaisnavas and the powerful effect all of these will have upon my conditioned existence, we know that someday our suffering will lead to happiness. I will remain patient and will go on serving Krsna\u2019s lotus feet. I\u2019ll expect that mercy will come either now, ten years from now, a hundred years from now, or in some future birth, but I\u2019ll never give up serving Krsna\u2019s lotus feet. That faith will lead to happiness. That\u2019s the symptom of taking shelter. And that faith one gets by taking shelter at the lotus feet of one\u2019s spiritual master. One becomes fearless, free from lamentation and happy. It may not manifest immediately. But sometimes we may get glimpses of it. \nI've often told this story about the experience I once had with my godbrother, Tamal Krsna Gosvami. He said something to me which meant so much to me that I was never able to forget it. \nI was sitting with him in 1980 in Mayapura. we were taking prasadam in a group. Nineteen hundred and eighty was only two and a half years after Srila Prabbhupada had departed, but I always saw Tamal Krsna Goswami as someone who associated a lot with Srila Prabhupada. \nWhile we were taking prasadam together, he all of a sudden spoke a few words to me. \"You are just the kind of brahmacari Prabhupada would really be pleased with.\" I said, \"Why do you say that, Maharaja?\" He said, \"Because you are happy with the simple things that Prabhupada gave us.\" It meant so much to me that my heart just melted. Then he said, \"You are happy reading Prabhupada\u2019s books, you are happy doing kirtan, you are happy taking prasadam, you are happy associating with devotees. These are the things Prabhupada came to give us and you are so happy with these simple things.\" It meant a lot to me, I felt like Srila Prabhupada was actually giving me some encouragement. These are the things Prabhupada came to give us. \nWe don\u2019t need to complicate things, it\u2019s very simple \u2013 chant, dance, take Krsna prasadam, then hear Krsna-katha \u2013 all these are meant to bring about our real happiness. Srila Prabhupada repeatedly stated it in many discourses that it was his mission. \"Our mission is to make others happy.\" That is real happiness, genuine happiness, not the kind of happiness that is \"capala-sukha\" flickering. We need to be genuinely happy with the simple things Srila Prabhupada so kindly came to give all of us. \nTherefore, in gratitude to him I\u2019ve spoken these few words tonight and how much it means to me to have the opportunity to serve him. I pray that someday he will accept me as his eternal servant and that I always remain eternally his disciple. Thank you. Hare Krsna.\n \n","nid":"6674"},{

As I mentioned yesterday, I don\u2019t travel as much I used to any more. And I don\u2019t have any future plans to resume traveling like I used to. I\u2019m not saying that I won\u2019t come back again. I just can\u2019t travel extensively. \nI thought that I would take advantage of this opportunity to have this personal meeting with you to try to discuss something relevant to your spiritual lives, possibly by taking a cue from a point that Sadhu Maharaja made yesterday. Maybe you\u2019d like to expand upon what you mentioned yesterday in the beginning of the talk? \nBhaktivedanta Sadhu Maharaja: When the disciples accept the spiritual master, they have a particular expectation of him. Oftentimes these expectations are based on the presumption that the spiritual master will be personally present in their lives and will give them his shelter and instructions personally. Even though you have so many times emphasized that the real shelter for your disciples is in your instructions, I have nevertheless, in most cases, seen that your disciples are not experienced enough to live according to your instructions. Especially, taking into consideration that our lives are increasingly complex, that\u2019s why we need more instructions, which will explain to us how to live in accordance with the previous instructions. (Audience laughs)\nNiranjana Maharaja: Which previous instructions are referring to? There are many of them.\nSadhu Maharaja: For example, one of the instructions you gave us, which has made a deep impression on my heart, is to serve the devotees, associate with the devotees, and stay with the devotees. Now we have to understand how to apply that in our lives. It\u2019s not so often we can see the examples of such devotees who are always in the association of other devotees and who feel inspired being around them, who feel they are in a real spiritual family. When I see devotees who are firmly situated in the association of the devotees, and take good association from them, I see they are firmly grounded and protected. They have the connection that you talked about yesterday. And I feel that you are satisfied with a disciple being protected and connected. (Audience laughs)\nNiranjana Maharaja: Nobody is trying to satisfy me in that way?\nSadhu Maharaja: That\u2019s a problem. And instead of getting protection in this way, the disciples tend to shift that responsibility on their spiritual master, blaming him for not giving enough shelter. The more instructions they get, they feel the connection less and less. \nNiranjana Maharaja: When you were saying that, I was reflecting on the 1970s, when Srila Prabhupada was present, and when we all personally felt how Prabhupada made the same emphasis for his disciples. Those of us who were present during Prabhupada's manifest pastimes have that advantage. We experienced how much Prabhupada emphasized that point also. Because Prabhupada not only had a vision of the movement during his presence but he also had a vision of the movement during his absence. The advantage\u2026Of course it was a disadvantage for us because Prabhupada was already quite old when he started this movement, but because he knew he wasn\u2019t going to be around for long, he saw that he needed to emphasize that point. Therefore it was also an advantage because it meant that we were able to realize this point. I remember three times Prabhupada was very ill since the time I joined. And each time he was very ill we had to engage in deep prayer and meditation to protect Prabhupada. He took advantage of that to emphasize to devotees how much they needed to associate with each other.\nPrabhupada gave very, very deep and strong support to his senior disciples. He didn\u2019t simply establish his senior disciples\u2019 seniority by dint of their managerial positions. He did so by dint of their faith. And Prabhupada emphasized that point again and again and again \u2013 that to the degree the devotees had faith in the ultimate goal of pure devotional service, to that degree there was a proper representative of the disciplic succession. Then Prabhupada empowered them to share that faith with others, and he strongly encouraged the younger devotees to see the senior disciples as representing Prabhupada on the strength of their faith in his instructions. Prabhupada taught us not to blindly accept those devotees simply because they were appointed. I could cite several instances when Prabhupada was very disturbed that devotees had blindly accepted the leaders and didn\u2019t speak out about them because their example was contradictory. \nHe gave us the foundation on which we should build our faith in the power of associating with devotees. That foundation was to the degree that we see others setting an example of chanting sixteen rounds, following the regulative principles, sharing Srimad-Bhagavatam, speaking Srimad-Bhagavatam, worshipping the Deities in the temple, and so on. Prabhupada would sometimes have his own disciples give Bhagavatam class in his presence. And he would personally display relish and pleasure upon hearing their realizations. He was teaching us by his example how to associate with each other. \nOne way to associate with each other is to actually become the type of internal devotees that we were speaking about yesterday and not to be external devotees who are looking for a position or a designation for themselves, who are not looking for external recognition from the spiritual master. Such external disciples are always trying to create an image of their spiritual lives when the spiritual master visits. They are the ones who always present themselves as if \u201cEverything is fine in my spiritual life.\u201d But when the spiritual master leaves, they disappear and get overwhelmed with their external lives, their obligations, and their commitments for survival. They make friends with people who can\u2019t really help them and avoid the association of those who can. \nThe result is that devotees don\u2019t actually capture the essence of what it means to associate with each other, because they base their association upon something external and are incapable of looking within their own hearts and observing what they actually need to advance in devotional service or what qualities in themselves they need to improve. These devotees tend to think, \u201cI don\u2019t need the association of other devotees. When I associate with other devotees, they don\u2019t appreciate me. Sometimes they point out certain characteristics in me that I don\u2019t like to hear about, and I would rather associate with people who don\u2019t point those characteristics out. Then it\u2019s easy to avoid having to look within myself when I associate with those types of people, and it\u2019s easier to find fault in the people who do point those things out.\u201d\nI often talk about these points in my lectures: How it\u2019s necessary to be internal in the spiritual life and to see whatever happens to us in the association of devotees as Krsna\u2019s arrangement. I can remember in 1975, in my own personal experience\u2026I told this story recently, but I\u2019ll tell it again because I think it\u2019s relevant. I was a sankirtana leader in the Boston temple. I was distributing books every day, taking out sankirtanaa devotees and organizing all the sankirtana in the temple. The temple president at that time\u2026I won\u2019t mention his name, but it wasn\u2019t Trai Dasa. The temple president for some reason had this fascination with insulting me publicly. It was difficult. Obviously. I was the sankirtana leader. I was organizing all the sankirtana. I was thinking, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he support me? Why does he insult me?\u201d I couldn\u2019t understand it, and I was becoming increasingly discouraged.\nBut in those days Prabhupada taught us that devotees like that, temple authorities, they were his representatives. This devotee was chanting sixteen rounds, he was following the principles, and he was really attached to Prabhupada. He was always talking about Prabhupada. He had many good qualities. But somehow he liked to insult me. (Maharaja laughs) He didn\u2019t do it all the time, but he did it at the times when he knew he would get the most advantage, the maximum reaction to the insult. I remember I was just praying to Prabhupada, \u201cPrabhupada, what are you trying to tell me? What am I supposed to learn from this?\u201d \nI didn\u2019t give up my service. Then, it was right at that time the temple president went away for a week, and I happened to be back in the temple, not on traveling sankirtana. I was usually always out traveling, but I happened to be back at the temple. I was asked to give Srimad-Bhagavatam class and, as it turned out, that week I gave several Srimad-Bhagavatam classes. The verses were exactly at the point in the Bhagavatam that Maharaja Rahugana insults Jada Bharata. The temple president didn\u2019t ask me to give classes on these verses. He wasn\u2019t there. The devotees in the temple said, \u201cYou\u2019re back from sankirtana. Would you please give class?\u201d Prabhupada was doing something. And there I was, sitting in Srimad-Bhagavatam class, speaking about an enlightened soul, Jada Bharata, and how he was totally unaffected by the insults of Maharaja Rahugana and how he had explained to Maharaja Rahugana that he was unaffected by the insults because he didn\u2019t identify with the body and therefore he didn\u2019t identify with the insults. The verses were very, very relevant and very, very poignant to what I was going through at that time. I remember sitting in class, speaking, and feeling overwhelmed in my heart. Not only was I overwhelmed by the arrangement Prabhupada and Krsna had made for me to speak on this topic but, because I was seeing it all in a very clear perspective, I also was feeling overwhelmingly grateful to the temple president. I just thought, \u201cHow would I ever be seeing this? How would I ever have been able to speak on these verses with such clarity if the president hadn\u2019t helped me?\u201d Krsna arranged the whole thing. And I continue to feel grateful to the president. Even after he returned, I continued with sankirtana and just accepted his insults. But it didn\u2019t last long. I never said anything to him. All of a sudden, one day it just stopped. He stopped insulting me, and I just continued doing my service.\nActually, it wasn\u2019t until about twenty-five years later that I happened to see that temple president. It was the first time I had seen him since that time in Boston, because he didn\u2019t stay the temple president. I was a sannyasi at that time in Moscow, and he came up to me. He was visiting Moscow. I can\u2019t remember why he was there. Probably it was the only time he was ever in the Soviet Union. It was in Begovaya. Now you\u2019ll probably try to figure out who it is. He came up to me, dropped down in front of me, and tried to touch my feet. I said, \u201cWhat you are doing?\u201d He said, \u201cPlease forgive me.\u201d I said, \u201cFor what?\u201d He said, \u201cI remember that I used to insult you. Here you are now a sannyasi. Just look at who you are and look who I am. I\u2019m completely trapped in materialistic life.\u201d And he said, \u201cPlease, forgive me for all that I did when you were the sankirtana leader.\u201d I said, \u201cForgive you for what? I was grateful. I have always kept that gratitude.\u201d He said, \u201cI can\u2019t live unless you say you forgive me.\u201d So I said, \u201cOK. I forgive you.\u201d I just embraced him. \nThat was what Prabhupada taught us. Prabhupada taught us how to live in the society of devotees. Prabhupada taught us how to accept, how to see Krsna in everything. Prabhupada taught us how to have faith that Krsna is actually very much a part of our lives and that the best way to see how Krsna is a part of our lives is to stay in the society of devotees, because it\u2019s the devotees who will help us in this way. It\u2019s the devotees who will actually help us to develop the qualities we need to become internal devotees. And it\u2019s the duty of the spiritual master to help the devotees realize the need for this association. If they don\u2019t understand, they will stay external devotees. If they don\u2019t understand that point, then they\u2019ll start thinking non-devotee qualities are more attractive. \nTherefore, how do we associate with the devotees? How do we break down our designations of devotees so that we can appreciate those devotees as we are serving Krsna? We have a tendency to play external roles in the association of devotees. \u201cI\u2019m a leader.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m a businessman. I give money. My service to my guru is to give him money when he comes. I have my service. I give him money and I don\u2019t have to do anything else. I don\u2019t have to worry about chanting my sixteen rounds, following the principles, associating with devotees.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m a bhakti-vrksa leader,\u201d and then I start thinking it\u2019s my job to control other people. Or we can think, \u201cI want to become a bhakti-vrksa leader,\u201d \u201cI want to become the temple president,\u201d \u201cI want to become a senior disciple so that everyone will respect me,\u201d \u201cI want to be seen as somebody who is close to the guru so that people will want to associate with me and serve me.\u201d\nEverybody plays these roles, and everybody tries to identify themselves in terms of external roles. They also deal with each other in terms of their external roles. But what\u2019s the one activity that when done together breaks down these designations? What\u2019s the one activity that Prabhupada hammered into our heads to do every day? Hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam, speaking about Srimad-Bhagavatam, chanting Hare Krsna together, and associating with each other. It\u2019s the process of purification. It\u2019s what cleanses the heart.\nSomeone may say, \u201cWell, I can do that only when there is a highly elevated devotee present. Otherwise I don\u2019t have the inspiration. I can\u2019t appreciate what this person has to offer to me.\u201d That\u2019s generally how devotees start labeling everybody in terms of their advancement in Krsna Consciousness. But a devotee is one who is adosa darsi \u2013 he doesn\u2019t look for the faults in others. He is not interested in seeing others shortcomings. He is interested in simply seeing the good qualities in others and appreciating their sincere desire to speak about Srimad-Bhagavatam. The best way to break down all these roles and to break the paradigm of seeing everybody in terms of external roles is to come together to hear and chant.\nBut we think we have more important things: \u201cI\u2019ve got my role, let me stick to it. These things are more important.\u201d But what makes a sadhaka \u2013 a devotee who is actually following the instructions of the spiritual master \u2013 is to see that the first and foremost instruction of the spiritual master is to be a sadhaka. First and foremost \u2013 everything else is secondary. Keep your laksmi. If you think that\u2019s important to me, keep it. Work less and spend more time hearing and chanting in the association of devotees. This is what our movement is all about. This is what Prabhupada wanted. He wanted a society of devotees who hear and chant the glories of the Supreme Lord together. \nAnd when devotees are doing that, what happens? They begin to appreciate each other. \u201cOh, just see how much they are trying to follow the instructions of the spiritual master.\u201d They want to hear from each other. When they have difficulties, they go and associate with those who inspire them. That\u2019s Rupa Goswami\u2019s instruction: dadati pratigrihnati guhyam akhyati pricchati. It\u2019s Rupa Goswami\u2019s instruction in Upadesamrita. He tells us that this is what it means to associate: to reveal one\u2019s mind in confidence and to inquire confidentially. Not to simply become absorbed in our own orbit and to think, \u201cMy service is the only important service. It\u2019s my connection with my spiritual master. I will do that service and neglect everybody else.\u201d\nThis is that example that I oftentimes give: When you are looking from a distance at the Himalayan Mountains, from a distance you just see Mount Everest. But when you get closer, you will see that there are many other subordinate mountains and many valleys, gorges, and other terrain. But when we are far away, we don\u2019t see them. We simply see Mount Everest. In a similar way, sometimes we think, \u201cOh, yes. There is just me and my spiritual master.\u201d But that means we are far away. We are not close. If you can only see the spiritual master and you don\u2019t see all the other devotees that are there serving, associating, hearing, then it means you are far away from the spiritual master. You are not close to him. If you want to become close to the spiritual master, you have to become close to everyone else who is serving the spiritual master.\nAnd in our movement, Srila Prabhupada is the founder-acarya, and everybody is serving, assisting his mission. And his mission, as he emphasized, was how to associate with each other in these ways. Personally, that\u2019s why I go and hear the Srimad-Bhagavatam classes of my godbrothers. I\u2019m very eager to sit and to hear them speak, to take part in kirtans with them. For me, it\u2019s the way I survive. If it was just me and my disciples, I don\u2019t know how I could survive. (Everybody laughs) Please don\u2019t take that in the wrong way. My association with my godbrothers means more to me than my life. I don\u2019t think I could live without them. When I see them leaving the planet, it\u2019s so painful, I\u2019m thinking I don\u2019t want to be around when they are all leaving around me. Anyway, these are some thoughts I can share on the topic. \nAnybody want to ask questions? I can go on speaking for a long time.\nDevotee: As Queen Kunti said, our problems are actually advantages, and we should take advantage of them. Our problems are nectar. Is it right that if we don\u2019t go to senior devotees and share our problems with them, then our problems are not instructive to us and we won\u2019t learn any lessons from them?\nNiranjana Maharaja: In one sense it\u2019s correct, yes. But the point is that everybody needs shelter. And for those who actually find shelter in the instructions of the spiritual master, those who have faith in the instructions of the spiritual master, those who remain undisturbed in the face of difficulties because of their faith in the spiritual master, then in due course of time they will also be helped. It\u2019s just like the example\u2026When that happened to me, when the temple president was insulting me, I never told anybody. To this day, the devotees who lived in the temple at that time don\u2019t know what was happening. They didn\u2019t know I was disturbed by those insults. Because I didn\u2019t go to anybody to complain about it. I never said anything to anyone.\nNow, someone may say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you complain? How could you let the temple president do something like that to you?\u201d I had enough faith, and I felt such a strong connection to Srila Prabhupada, that somehow I knew it was for my purification. I thought, \u201cLet me try to understand it.\u201d So I got help from Srila Prabhupada and Krsna in the heart. And everything was dealt with. I got the shelter that I needed. The difficulty is when we don\u2019t have shelter. And when we don\u2019t have faith, we start placing our faith in external things. Instead of placing our faith in the association of devotees, we start placing our faith in material enjoyment. We start placing our faith in our material comforts. Sometimes devotees start placing their faith in intoxication. Obviously they don\u2019t have shelter. If there is no shelter, then they have to see how shelter is available in the society of devotees and they should take advantage of it. They have to make the effort, thinking, \u201cI want to be helped.\u201d And then Krsna will help. If they don\u2019t make the effort, then they will be outside of the society of devotees. \nSo, yes. The devotee has to take that initiative and go to somebody who can help him or her. Every devotee should have somebody close to them, somebody in their circle that they can reveal their mind to \u2013 a confidential friend who is not going to just encourage them to take shelter in intoxication and sense gratification but who is actually going to encourage them to take shelter in the holy name and in the association of devotees. Everybody needs that. If we can\u2019t appreciate, if we can\u2019t see that there is somebody who is capable of giving that association, then we have to consider that maybe there are some faults in our own hearts and that's why we can\u2019t see. Even if we can\u2019t immediately see devotees who we think are more advanced, then we should approach our equals and present ourselves as less advanced. Krsna can speak through them too. If we are actually praying to Krsna, \u201cPlease, I have no shelter. I need the association of devotees. Please help me. I'm going to go to this devotee. Let me see You through the words of this devotee so I don\u2019t have to listen to my crazy mind and look to sense gratification for shelter.\u201d Approach even a devotee who is your equal, but place yourself lower than him or her. Krsna can speak through anyone; in fact, He may say something very relevant. \nDevotee: Probably due to a lack of good association, as you said, I had a difficult time with my sadhana for the last few years. I want to take this advantage to ask your blessings for renewed strength in maintain my sadhana: to chant sixteen rounds every day, to read Srila Prabhupadaa\u2019s books every day, and to associate with devotees.\nNiranjana Maharaja: I give my renewed blessings. (Maharaja laughs)\nDevotee: By associating with devotees, I came to the conclusion that Maya acts through devotees, not just Krsna. Is it correct to think in this way, or should we think that only Krsna \u2013 not Maya \u2013 acts through His devotees?\nNiranjana Maharaja: Well, to answer your question in relationship to yesterday\u2019s talk, in which we heard that even Maya helps the devotees\u2026Because, when we see something is Maya, that pushes us towards Krsna. When [we choose Krsna over Maya,] we want only Krsna. In other words, yes, sometimes a devotee may be representing Maya in his dealings, and therefore we may choose to associate with such a person at a distance. But when we see that \u201cI need to avoid the illusion that I\u2019m getting from this devotee,\u201d then we look for those who will give us Krsna. Maya helps us also. She helps us by tempting us, so that we actually have to use our discrimination to turn away from Her and take shelter of Krsna. For one who is always in Krsna Consciousness\u2026Krsna surya sama, maya haya andhakara: \u201cWherever there is Krsna Consciousness, there is no Maya.\u201d But for those who are not always in Krsna Consciousness, we have to discriminate what is Krsna and what is not Krsna, so that when Maya is tempting us, we turn to Krsna. In this way, such devotees may help us to understand who we should avoid and who we should associate with. \nDevotee: I want to thank you, Guru Maharaja, for participating in my life, not directly, but through those devotees who you have trained. So many things in my have life changed [because of them]. Thank you very much. \nNiranjana Maharaja: That is my aspiration. That\u2019s one reason why I have been accepting fewer disciples, because I believe it\u2019s more important to place emphasis on devotees who can help the younger devotees. I just came from Moscow. Now when I visit Moscow I\u2019m not giving so many public lectures. I\u2019m not spending so much time in general meetings personally meeting with disciples. Still, I go there for sometimes two weeks at a time. And the devotees wonder what I\u2019m doing. Why am I not sitting on a stage with throngs of people in attendance? Everybody applauds my lecture, and then everybody leaves, and nobody is changed. I\u2019m not very inspired to speak to large crowds of people when everybody claps their hands at the end of the lecture and then they go away and nobody changes. I don\u2019t come to entertain.\nSo I minimize those kinds of functions, and I\u2019m spending all my time with older devotees, helping them to understand how they can associate with each other, whether they are my disciples or not my disciples. It\u2019s irrelevant. We shouldn\u2019t have guru clubs in this movement. We associate with each other because we are all under Prabhupada's shelter. So I\u2019m meeting with the senior devotees day in and day out and having meetings to teach them how to associate with each other, how to become inspired in the association of each other, and how to share the inspiration they get from each other with the devotees under their care. That\u2019s the focus of my energy. And sometimes disciples feel like, \u201cWe\u2019re being neglected.\u201d But they don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m not intentionally neglecting anyone. I\u2019m trying to help you to see that there is more to association than just simply coming and clapping at my lectures and then, when I go away, your life goes back to exactly the way it was before. What kind of guru is that? Satisfied with a show? If he really cares, he wants to create the sort of society you feel sheltered in. There is nothing more painful to me than when a devotee comes and takes shelter of Prabhupadaa\u2019s lotus feet, sacrifices so many years of his life, and then leaves the society of devotees. I can\u2019t tolerate it. There is nothing more painful. \nDevotee: Guru Maharaja, I want to thank you for your wonderful disciples who help me very much in my life. You are so good at training them. In Yekaterinburg, my godsisters support me so much. Ratnavati always asks me how my japa is and it gives me proper focus. She is such a wonderful devotee. You know, she is conducting cooking classes, and many people who were taking her cooking classes became devotees, became initiated and practice very seriously. Her energy is enough for everybody. She takes such great care of others. And she is always inspired and is always doing service. And also Vrajabhumi inspires me very much. We are always communicating on the phone with each other, and she always shares her realizations with me. And I like when Rasalika speaks about the Holy Dhama. She has a passionate character, and when she applies her passion to spiritual life, she gets completely absorbed in it. Despite her difficulties, she always tries to place her heart in the proper place, and that\u2019s a good example for me. I don\u2019t have such close association with my other godsisters, but when I associate with them, it always gives me inspiration in spiritual life. Thank you very much, Guru Maharaja. \nNiranjana Maharaja: I answered your letter two days ago about Rasalika.\nDevotee: In yesterday\u2019s lecture you said that materialists daydream about material enjoyment. But a devotee also has dreams. In the case of materialists, the realization of those dreams is very easy for them: \u201cJust do it.\u201d But in the case of devotees, sometimes these dreams that devotees have become aspirations, but when it comes to realizing them there is no short cut. Is there any way to help devotees make their dreams reality?\nNiranjana Maharaja: Prabhupada gives an example in the Bhagavatam about material desires being like the flow of a river. He says that trying to stop our material desires is like trying to enter the river and stop it from flowing. But he also says that a river eventually enters the ocean. And when the river enters the ocean, the ocean being more powerful than the river pushes back the flow of the river. He gives that as an analogy, saying that, in a similar way, our material desires maybe very difficult to control. But if we fill our mind and heart with desires to serve the Lord, that will push back the influence of material desires. Prabhupada explains that means we should always be making plans for Krsna\u2019s pleasure. We also have to make plans. We also should have dreams. But those dreams should be not our own. If we want to be successful in our endeavors, we have to make sure that our dreams are completely connected to the instructions coming down through parampara. Even though our dreams may not be realized so quickly, we should have faith if we see that those dreams are connected [to the desires of the parampara]. \nI oftentimes quote the verses in the Bhagavad-Gita in which Krsna says, \u201cIn all activities just think of Me and work under My protection. In such devotional service you should be conscious of Me. If you become conscious of Me, you\u2019ll cross over all the obstacles of conditional life by My grace. But if you are not conscious of Me and act out of false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.\u201d (BG 18.57\u201358)\nTherefore, a devotee must always be conscious of his subordinate position to superior instruction. If he is conscious, then he can remain patient and have faith that he\u2019ll realize his dreams, because he will understand that he is not realizing his dreams. The seed for realizing his dreams has already been planted in the order [of the spiritual master or the parampara], and he has faith that because the order is there it will manifest. That\u2019s how to realize one\u2019s dreams, to always remain conscious of that. But if you are not conscious of that \u2013 if you have big dreams and you think you are the doer \u2013 then even if you realize your dream, it will turn into a nightmare. \nDevotee: This is a continuation of the same question: How can we feel personal responsibility for executing the higher order? \nNiranjana Maharaja: We take the order from those in whom we have faith that the parampara is being represented. For instance, Prabhupada never gave me any orders to preach in the Soviet Union. All the instructions Prabhupada ever gave me came from my temple president \u2013 a different temple president. (Maharaja laughs) Prabhupada told that temple president to take care of me. (Everybody laughs) He said something like \u201cTake good care of him\u2026Devotees are very important,\u201d something like that. But Prabhupada never gave me any direct order to preach in the Soviet Union. Still, it was clear to me that Prabhupada wanted me to preach, and I saw \u2013 by coming here and preaching here \u2013 I saw that it is connected to Prabhupada\u2019s instructions. And I have faith that by following these instructions, it will help deepen my attachment to Prabhupada. I didn\u2019t see anything separate from Prabhupada\u2019s wishes. That meditation is what gave me the faith and determination to continue to do it. \nI have not just one example, I have many examples of similar experiences. Without seeing it connected to Prabhupada's wishes, it would have been very difficult to continue. I can tell you many other stories about things I was asked to do by one person, even though there were obstacles I faced because of so many others. But because I had faith that what I was asked to do was connected to Prabhupada\u2019s desires, it helped me to meditate on Prabhupada and to depend on him. Therefore it gave me the determination and strength to go on in the face of obstacles. That\u2019s what gives us the strength to overcome obstacles. But if we don\u2019t have that connection, and if we don\u2019t have faith that [a particular course of action] is something that the spiritual master wants us to do, it\u2019s very easy to give it up. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult. I\u2019ll give it up and do something else.\u201d\nBut if we have that faith that \u201cNo, this is what my guru\u2026siksa- or diksa-guru, whoever is the guru in my life who awakens faith in my heart\u2026\u201d And if we actually make that connection\u2026Then we can overcome all obstacles and difficulties and continue to serve, and not simply accept and reject on the basis of some whim. It\u2019s not artificial, making that connection. It depends on our faith. To the degree that our faith is strong in pure devotional service\u2026You\u2019ll know, It will be tangible. You\u2019ll feel connected. And when faith is weak, then you have to associate with those who help you make that connection. Without faith, it\u2019s very difficult. \nDevotee: Are there conditions to be fulfilled in the association of devotees that will invoke Krsna\u2019s presence. Is it sufficient to bring our bodies and our gross senses into the association of devotees, or is there something else required? Is it sufficient to use our mind to invoke Krsna\u2019s presence without bringing our own perception of Krsna.\nNiranjana Maharaja: I\u2019m not sure that I fully understand the question, but let me start, and you can tell me if I\u2019m connecting to your question. You ask is there a way to invoke Krsna\u2019s presence by the collective endeavors of the devotees. Essentially, is what you are asking? \nTranslator: She is asking about the conditions that have to be fulfilled.\nNiranjana Maharaja: The condition is that the devotees are united in their purpose to make Krsna present. In the Fourth Canto of the Bhagavatam, Prabhupada talks about this in the story of Pracetas and how the Prachetas performed austerities. Because they were united in executing their austerities, the Lord was very pleased to bestow benedictions upon them. They were all united in their purpose. Not only did they give their bodies but they gave their minds as well. Therefore, on that basis they were united. There are different types of austerities. There are austerities of the body, but there are also austerities of the mind. Our austerity of the mind is to be united in service to Krsna. That\u2019s our austerity.\nAnd therefore the devotees who are gathered to perform that sacrifice have a responsibility to invoke Krsna\u2019s presence by His words and by His instructions so that they can all be united in purpose. Just like the sages assembled in the forest of Naimisaranya \u2013 immediately the proper mood was set. Suta Goswami immediately established the proper mood in which the sacrifice was to be performed. He said, \u201cO sages, I have been justly questioned by you. Your questions are glorious because they relate to Lord Krsna, and only questions of this nature can satisfy the self.\u201d So, to satisfy everybody\u2019s united purpose, he spoke the Bhagavatam. And they were all there for that reason. \nnaham tisthami vaikunthe\nyoginam hrdayesu va\ntatra tisthami narada\nyatra gayanti mad-bhaktah\nKrsna told Narada, \"I am not in the hearts of yogis. I\u2019m not in the Vaikuntha planets. But I go to that place wherever My devotees are discussing My glories.\" (Padma Purana)\nSo Krsna appears wherever the devotees are united in purpose. And our austerity of the mind is to be united in purpose, because it is Kali-yuga, and the nature of Kali-yuga is to be disunited. That is Kali. That is what Kali does. Kali creates disunity. \nDevotee: I want to ask you, What does my spiritual master want from me? You said that because it became clear to you what your spiritual master wanted from you, the path was clear and you were determined to aspire for the goal. \nNiranjana Maharaja: I want you to repeat my instructions and teach by your example. \nSame devotee: I have had to leave Omsk for five months each a year for the last four years and stay in the village, where there are no devotees. This is a circumstance of my life. It\u2019s very difficult to tolerate. There I don\u2019t have a connection with the devotees. The only way is to communicate over the phone. Because I have to live there for so long every year, all my connections that I have established with the devotees break. And when I come back, I\u2019m like a newcomer. \nNiranjana Maharaja: That\u2019s your obstacle. That\u2019s the obstacle you need to overcome on the strength of your faith in the power of association with devotees. Everybody has his or her obstacles.\nAny quick questions?\nA Devotee: I want to ask about the balance between material duties and spiritual practice. \nNiranjana Maharaja: That is not a quick question. Do the devotees know about the website? All these questions are answered in lectures. I must have given a hundred lectures about how to balance spiritual life with material obligations. \n \n","nid":"6659"},{

Included is an introductory talk by Bhakti Vijnana Goswami.\nThe file is available for downloading at the bottom of the page.\n\nBhakti Vijnana Goswami:\nyo \u2018ntah pravisya mama vacam imam prasuptam\nsanjivayaty akhila-sakti-dharah sva-dhamna\nanyams ca hasta-carana-sravana-tvag-adin\npranan namo bhagavate purusaya tubhyam\nHare Krsna\nSrila Niranjana Swami asked me to start this program, so I will speak for a few minutes about what is in my heart. Before starting, I would like to apologize; at about five o\u2019clock I have to leave you because at six o\u2019clock there is another program starting at another place. Therefore, at that time I will leave you alone with Maharaja, which I am sure is what you all want. \nI will speak few words about the importance of associating with a sadhu. Again and again in Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures, sadhu-sanga, association with sadhus, with people who have dedicated themselves to Krsna, is glorified as the most powerful method for transforming the heart. Sri Caitanya-caritamrta stresses this and tells us that all perfection and any success in life can be achieved by even one moment\u2019s association with a sadhu. Therefore one moment of associating with a sadhu \u2013 lava matra sadhu sanga \u2013 which brings one all perfection, first of all means that faith may appear in the heart. One should know very well that when the Caitanya-caritamrta speaks about \u201call perfection,\u201d sarva siddhi haya, it does not mean all types of mystic perfection, nor does it refer to different miracles. Sometimes people seek association with holy men, sadhus, to see miracles, to become objects of those miracles, and to get some tangible benefit from those miracles. But the actual miracle, the real miracle that happens as a result of hearing from a sadhu is sraddha, \u201cfaith,\u201d which appears in the heart of one who has associated with a sadhu. \nThe whole material world tries somehow or other to destroy our faith in God. The material world is a place for people who don\u2019t believe in God. And we will always, somehow or other, have to meet and interact with such people. However, one moment\u2019s association with a pure person can awaken our faith. And this faith, when deepening in the process of hearing, will finally bring one all perfections. All of these perfections do not come at once, but they definitely will come if we succeed in protecting the creeper of this faith. Srimad-Bhagavatam stresses this point: \nsatam prasangan mama virya-samvido\nbhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah\ntaj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani\nsraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati\n(SB 3.25.25)\nSrimad-Bhagavatam stresses that definitely everything we want in life will come as a result if we open our heart to a sadhu. The words of Srimad-Bhagavatam that emphasize this point are satam prasangan. Not simply sanga. Sanga means sa-anga; it means that physically we may be close to each other. But prasanga means that we succeeded to bring our heart in touch with the heart of sadhu, which is where Krsna stays. This is the only way to get in touch with Krsna in this world because Krsna lives in the heart of the sadhu. If somehow or other we can arrange that our heart comes in touch with the heart of a sadhu, we will touch Krsna directly. And the result will be that our spiritual life will go deeper and deeper with each moment. \nFaith is the first step, the first effect of transformation of the heart, and this is already a big step. A nonbeliever, who never had faith, at once becomes a believer. Sometimes people write me about this transformation, how after meeting a book distributor in the street they got this faith. One man wrote me that when he met a book distributor \u2013 in his head there was so much nonsense and garbage, as he himself wrote \u2013 and he met this book distributor, who very humbly offered him a book. And he started to throw away, to unload all his garbage on the head of this book distributor. \u201cAs a result,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I unloaded all my garbage on him, I took a book, because I felt obliged to him. He listened to me with patience for so long. I started to listen to a recording that came with the book.\u201d And he said, \u201cA miracle happened. Everything in my heart transformed because of this short meeting with a person who has faith.\u201d \nOur life may turn around, 180 degrees. But we want exactly this. We don\u2019t want superficial religiosity. We don\u2019t want to simply come here and perform rituals. We want that our heart becomes deeper and deeper and deeper. Now our heart is very shallow and therefore periodically in there is a storm. But generally these are like storms in a glass of water. Because of some small thing, or even nothing: \u201cSomebody looked at me the wrong way!\u201d Again, storm. \u201cSomebody didn\u2019t look at me! He passed me by.\u201d Again, storm. And if somebody says the wrong word, this is not a storm anymore, it is a hurricane that does not subside. Why? Because our heart is so small; a small heart is very easy to disturb. This shallow, not deep, heart is the cause of all our problems. \nBut after getting in touch with the bottomless heart of a sadhu, a heart where the endless Supreme Lord lives, then we can feel what it means. As Krsna explains in the Bhagavad-gita, when one\u2019s heart is as deep as the ocean, it becomes calm, immovable. No matter how many different things \u2013 rivers, desires, or something else \u2013 falls into this heart, it remains immovable because of its depth. When it is like samudra \u2013 samudra means something very deep, having depth \u2013 then the heart remains calm and happy. This is the result, this is what we are looking for, this is what we want to find after meeting sadhu. In this deep heart gradually Krsna starts to live. \nBefore I end my short introduction and give you an opportunity to feel all the benefits of associating with a sadhu in the form of the words of Srila Niranjana Swami, I would like to tell you one more important thing. When a person becomes deep inside, Krsna explains what happens in his heart. He starts thinking about Krsna in his heart. In a small heart there is no place for thoughts about Krsna, because thoughts about Krsna cannot fit there, cannot even enter there. What I would like to say is that as a result of all our practice finally we should come to this state in which we remember Krsna. \nTuesday, the twenty-fourth, we will have a special program, about which I want to tell you. Srila Niranjana Maharaja will take part in this program. Essentially it will be a kirtan. This program will be dedicated to a wonderful event. On April 24th in India, sthapatis, people who know the art of making the form of the Lord, will start inviting Sri Sri Radha and Krsna to come here, to Moscow. But actually we need to understand that they will be able to make only those Deities whom we ourselves invite. Our meditation is the most important part. I was told, when meeting with these people, that they never know what will appear under their cutting tool. They told me that this is a completely mysterious process. \u201cOnce,\u201d he said, \u201cwe got an order to sculpt Radha and Krsna. Afterwards, Radha and Krsna appeared to have slightly Chinese eyes. We were somewhat disturbed. We thought that, who knows, maybe they will refuse. Maybe they will not like Them. But when our customers came, they said, \u2018This is exactly what we need, because our people have such eyes. This is exactly what we required.\u2019\u201d How did that happen? This is the result of a mystical process. \nRadha and Krsna appear in a particular form in response to our desire to serve. Therefore we would like to invite you all to this program, to this kirtan Tuesday evening at six o\u2019clock, when we will meditate on inviting Radha and Krsna, when we will try to make our hearts as deep as possible. We will try to do something so that the forms of Radha and Krsna appear in our hearts and so that They believe us \u2013 because They will come here only if They believe that we will serve Them. If They do not believe, They will not come. \nI just wanted to tell you this in relation to today\u2019s program: to invite you to that program, and once more rejoice with you about this visit of Srila Niranjana Maharaja, whom we are always so anxious to see. Please, let\u2019s welcome him with a loud \u201cHaribol!\u201d Thank you very much.\nNiranjana Swami:\nom ajnana-timirandhasya\njnananjana-salakaya\ncaksur unmilitam yena\ntasmai sri-gurave namah\nmukam karoti vachalam \npangum langhayate girim \nyat-kripa tam aham vande \nshri-gurum dina-taranam\nnama om visnu-padaya \nkrsna-presthaya bhu-tale\nsrimate bhaktivedanta-\nsvamin iti namine\nnamaste sarasvate deve \ngaura-vani pracarine\nnirvisesa-sunyavadi-\npascatya-desa-tarine\n(jaya) sri-krsna-caitanya\n prabhu-nityananda\nsri-advaita gadadhara\nsrivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrnda\nHare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare\nFirst I\u2019d like to thank Bhakti Vijnana Maharaja for being here, even for the short time that he\u2019s able to stay.\nHe just said, \u201clava-matra.\u201d [Maharaja laughs.] Confirmed. [Maharaja laughs again.] \u201c\u2018Sadhu-sanga\u2019 \u2018sadhu-sanga\u2019\u2014sarva-sastre kaya.\u201d\nI thank you all also for coming to take part in our Sunday program.\nBhakti Vijnana Maharaja\u2019s introductory words about the importance of associating with a devotee are universal. He certainly wasn\u2019t speaking about me. He was speaking about the importance of associating with Vaishnavas. I am an aspiring Vaishnava. Someday I hope to be able to fit the bill that he described. But certainly all that he explained is essential for our development in Krsna consciousness.\nWe\u2019ll speak a little bit more about that, but first I wanted to touch upon the last point that Maharaja mentioned. It came to my mind as he was talking about welcoming Radha and Krsna here in Moscow. I was recently just reading Sri Chaitanya-bhagavata, in which Srila Vrindavan Das Thakur explains that the Supreme Lord manifests in this world in five forms. He manifests in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Ganges, Tulasi-devi, and the Vaishnavas. He said that the Lord immediately appears in these four forms. In the fifth form He also appears, but only after He\u2019s welcomed. The words are prana pratistha, actually, which refer to when the Lord\u2019s presence is invoked by the intense prayer of a Vaishnava. So Bhakti Vijnana Maharaja is giving you all that opportunity to take part in that process.\nPrana pratistha is usually done at the time when the Deities are installed. I remember actually in\u2026I think it was 2004, when Sri Panca-tattva were installed in Mayapur. I was asked to come on the altar to take part in the prana pratistha of the Panca-tattva. Many devotees were, not just myself. But we all took part simultaneously in the process of inviting the Panca-tattva to appear with prayer and with mantras and, with kusa grass, touching the forms of the deities. And all of us were meditating simultaneously on performing that service on behalf of Srila Prabhupada to invoke the Lord\u2019s presence to manifest in that arca form. But now Maharaja has very mercifully extended that by having you all participate in inviting Them to come as well. \nThe power of prayer can never be minimized, especially when it\u2019s done with the collective desire of the Vaishnavas. I can understand that the purpose of this gathering is actually to make all of you aware of the need to invite Them, Radha and Krsna, into your lives. Not just so that you can do it on the evening of the 24th. But also you should continue the process of hearing and chanting Their glories to deepen your attachment to having Their presence in your lives in the ways that Maharaja described in the other part of his talk. If you want to be consistent with your desire to invite Them, then you should also continue, in your talks and in your discussions amongst Vaishnavas, to draw the attention of the Lord to appear in that form by discussing topics about Him. And certainly that will make the Lord and His consort very much inclined to appear for the benefit of all of you, not just in the form of stone but also to manifest Themselves in those forms so that you can render service to Them.\nThere are many examples. Srila Prabhupada spoke on this topic when he installed Deities in various places throughout the world, when Srila Prabhupada would place that \u201cburden\u201d of responsibility on the devotees after the Lord appeared. Of course it\u2019s a burden of love, but Srila Prabhupada emphasized, \u201cNow I have called Krsna to come for all of you. You should never think that \u2018My spiritual master has given us a burden around the neck.\u2019\u201d He was aware that devotees may think, \u201cOh, so many more things need to be done.\u201d Where Radha and Krsna are installed there are seven offerings a day, and so many other services are required for Their pleasure. You should all pray for the opportunity to take part in that service. \nThese are just a few thoughts that came to my mind when Maharaja made that announcement at the end. I wanted to share them with you. Please don\u2019t just come on the 24th and think your business is finished. That will be the beginning of your seva to Their Lordships before They manifest here. Please be conscious and aware of the opportunities to continue that seva. \nSo\u2026The association of a Vaishnava, and how the association of a Vaishnava deepens one\u2019s attachment to the Lord\u2026Last night we gave a program at \u2013 they call it \u201cGoloka Family\u201d \u2013 and to all those who gathered there we spoke about the Holy Name. And we spoke a lot about the importance of establishing our connection with the Supreme, and how chanting the Holy Name of the Lord is the means for making this connection. We also spoke about how, when one establishes a connection with the Supreme, one transcends the dualities of this temporary world on the strength of that connection. We have temporarily established a connection with this temporary world. But the primary goal of life is to establish our connection with the Supreme. And once that connection is firmly established, one transcends\u2026One does not have any contact with this world.\nJust as the lotus flower may sit on the water but is never in the water \u2013Srila Prabhupada explains that the lotus flower has a film protecting it from being submerged in water \u2013 that\u2019s why when we refer to the spiritual master, we often refer to the lotus feet of the spiritual master. Every day we pray to Srila Prabhupada, to \u201cthe lotus feet of our spiritual master,\u201d because he\u2019s not in this world. He always remains \u2013 although in contact with this world \u2013 never influenced by this world. So that is the symptom of somebody whose connection is complete. \nI was thinking recently (I was also discussing this today with Bhakti Vijnana Maharaja), I was remembering a quote that Srila Prabhupada once wrote to one devotee. I think it was in 1972. It was something that he said many times. But the first time he said it was in 1972. It was just prior to my moving into the temple. In this letter to this devotee, Srila Prabhupada said, \u201cNow we should concentrate on increasing the Krsna consciousness of our devotees and increasing the Krsna consciousness of ourselves. And we should not be so much concerned about expanding our propagation everywhere at the risk of reducing the spiritual content of our message.\u201d He said, \u201cJust like milk, when it\u2019s boiled. When we are boiling milk, it becomes thicker and sweeter.\u201d He said, \u201cNow is the time to boil the milk.\u201d That was 1972.\nPrabhupada was writing to this devotee who happened to be my GBC at the time. And, as I said, he repeated it more than once to other devotees as well. And, when he talked about this process of \u201cboiling the milk,\u201d he specifically said, \u201cNow we should be very concerned about increasing the Krsna consciousness of the devotees and ourselves.\u201d He was speaking about the general devotees and the leaders who are\u2026taking care of the general devotees.\nWhat does this actually mean? How is it applied? When is it applied? How do we know\u2026Prabhupada said it in 1972\u2026How do we know when we should apply it and when is it not really the time to apply it? After all, Prabhupada gave different instructions at different times. \nI remember when\u2026very, very clearly\u2026when Prabhupada was speaking so much about how wonderful it was that the devotees were getting married and being very active preachers in Krsna consciousness and proving that householders could be just as effective in spreading Krsna consciousness as those who were renunciants. But there was also a time\u2026I remember in 1975\u2026when Prabhupada actually said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to have anything to do with this anymore.\u201d [Meaning getting devotees married.] He said it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take part. I am finished.\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t keep that position. At a later time he came back and started encouraging the householders again.\nObviously, because persons whose vision is very deep can actually see things from a proper perspective, they may have to adjust things according to time, place, and circumstances. Therefore as followers of Srila Prabhupada we have to be very careful not to extract a particular instruction according to time, place, and circumstance and make it universally applicable at all times.\nAnother example I can remember is from 1975, when Srila Prabhupada sent a letter to the temple president in Chicago and said that he wanted all the devotees out of the temple to distribute books. He wanted one devotee left in the temple to worship the Deities all day long. In 1975, Prabhupada wrote that to my godbrother Sri Govinda, and that letter was circulated everywhere. Temples were emptying out. Very few devotees were staying back. So, of course, Prabhupada adjusted things again, as he many times did while he was physically present.\nPrabhupada used to give the example that the spiritual master, because he has the perspective, he knows how to give instructions when they are needed. Prabhupada explained that a captain in charge of a ship may tell the navigator to turn to the left to avoid an iceberg. And then he may say, \u201cNow turn to the right! Now turn to the left!\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? You just told me to turn left! Why did you tell me turn right? Now you\u2019re saying turn left, turn right \u2013 which direction do you want?\u201d So, Prabhupada used that example also \u2013 that when navigating a ship sometimes it\u2019s necessary to make adjustments to avoid catastrophe. Just recently there was one catastrophe off the coast of Italy; the captain wasn\u2019t there to give appropriate instructions at the appropriate time.\nTherefore, in 1972, Srila Prabhupada gave this instruction: \u201cIt\u2019s time to boil the milk. And we have to be very careful now that we don\u2019t concentrate on simply expanding at the risk of losing our spiritual content. And we should be very conscientious about increasing our own Krsna consciousness.\u201d \nWe should take a look at that. Does that mean that we should\u2026We can sometimes take part of that message\u2026Like, for instance, \u201cOkay, we shouldn\u2019t focus on expanding at the risk of losing our content.\u201d We can take one part of the instruction and think that there may be times when we don\u2019t have to worry about increasing our Krsna consciousness or the Krsna consciousness of others. In the same way, we shouldn\u2019t just take one part \u2013 to not focus on expanding \u2013 but then we don\u2019t do anything to increase our Krsna consciousness. No, increasing our Krsna consciousness and the consciousness of all the devotees is an instruction that always has to be there.\nSrila Prabhupada said this because he wanted to emphasize it at that point in time \u2013 that we should pay exclusive attention to increasing our Krsna consciousness. But does that mean, after we\u2019ve done that, \u201cOkay, I can neglect that. I paid attention on my Krsna consciousness, so now that I\u2019ve done that I can neglect it and think about something else\u201d? No, that instruction is for all time. It is the responsibility of every one of us to be thinking how to increase our Krsna consciousness and Krsna consciousness of others. \nBecause, as we said, in connection to the topic about being connected to Krsna: On the strength of our connection to Krsna in Krsna consciousness\u2026To the degree we are connected to Krsna, to that degree we are disconnected from this temporary material world and our identification with this material world, which is filled with so many external designations. There\u2019s really only one designation for every living being. But to be in this material world means that designation has been covered by so many other temporary designations. Srila Prabhupada would oftentimes speak about what those designations are. They are the designations connected to this physical body: man, woman, husband, wife, father, son, boss, employee, president, citizen. There are so many designations.\nWhen Lord Caitanya instructed Srila Rupa Goswami he gave many essential instructions to Rupa Goswami about characteristics of devotional service. Lord Caitanya met Rupa and Sanatana first in Ramakeli and then later Rupa Goswami met Lord Caitanya in Prayag while the Lord was travelling to Vrindavan. For ten continuous days Lord Caitanya instructed Srila Rupa Goswami on the science of devotional service. Contained within those instructions were very essential verses that Rupa Goswami included in his Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu.\nI\u2019m sure everyone knows at least some of these verses. Those of you who are practitioners, sadhakas, must have heard some of these verses before. But even those who have not heard these verses before, when we quote them to you, we\u2019re sure you will be able to understand essence of their meanings. The first verse is a well-known verse:\nanyabhilasita-sunyam\njnana-karmady-anavritam\u2026 \n(BRS 1.1.11)\nFirst-class devotional service develops when one becomes free from all material desires, when one becomes free from the knowledge obtained by monistic philosophy, and when one becomes free from fruitive action. Devotional service must be rendered constantly, in a favorable way, according to Krsna\u2019s desire. These are the characteristics of bhakti. Bhakti means devotional service rendered with the intention to please Krsna. It must be performed constantly, and it has to be free from all material desires, including the desire for liberation and the desire for fruitive gain.\nThe next verse in Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu Rupa Gosvami quotes from the Caitanya-caritamrta, but it was because it was Lord Caitanya instructed him in this verse.\nsarvopadhi-vinirmuktam\ntat-paratvena nirmalam\nhrsikena hrsikesa\nsevanam bhaktir ucyate\n(Cc. Madhya 19.170)\nBhakti, or devotional service, must be rendered to satisfy the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; it must be rendered with all of one\u2019s senses, to satisfy the Supreme Lord Hrsikesa, who is the master of the senses. \nWhen the living entity renders service to the Supreme Lord in this way there are two by-products. The first is that one becomes free from all material designations. And the second is that one\u2019s senses become completely purified. In other words, when one actually renders service to the Supreme Lord in this favorable way, the automatic by-product is that we lose our connection with the temporary designations of this world. As we have explained, these designations are the cause of so much conflict in this world because the tendency is to see everyone according to some external designation. When we try to please someone, to satisfy someone, to serve someone according to some external designation, it doesn\u2019t satisfy the self. \nIn a similar vein, it\u2019s stated in Sri Isopanisad that one who sees all living entities as spiritual sparks, qualitatively one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of things. What, then, can be illusion or anxiety for him? There\u2019s no illusion, there\u2019s no anxiety for such a person who sees all living entities as spiritual sparks, qualitatively one with the Lord. \nvidya-vinaya-sampanne \nbrahmane gavi hastini\u2026\n(BG 5.18)\nAs Krsna says in the Bhagavad-gita, \u201cThe humble sage, by virtue of his true wisdom, sees with equal vision the gentle and learned Brahman, the elephant, the cow, the dog, and even the dog-eater.\u201d \nOne has to see with equal vision. One has to see the soul, or recognize the existence of the soul, within the temporary body. But to transcend these designations does not mean that we artificially negate their existence. We should not misunderstand this verse by thinking, \u201cOkay, all of us should immediately come to the transcendental position artificially.\u201d\nIn fact, there are verses in Srimad-Bhagavatam that describe how such persons, who pretend they are on the liberated platform, simply create havoc. We cannot imitate a person who is fully connected with the Supreme, just as we cannot imitate the way Srila Prabhupada managed his society by saying one thing at one time and saying another thing at another time. We do not imitate our previous acaryas. Our position is to follow in their footsteps. Following in their footsteps means that we should see the example they taught by their own words and actions, and, knowing what is the goal, we should traverse that same path they left behind for us to follow.\nThere\u2019s a verse in the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam that explains the same principle: the Vaishnavas go to the spiritual world but they leave behind the boat they used to cross the ocean of material life so that we can also cross in the same boat. They leave behind the boat in the form of their instructions and also, as the verse explains, in the form of their prayers. Just as the Lord brought those great Vaishnavas to the other side of the ocean of material existence, in the same way the Lord is very inclined, on the strength of the prayers of those great Vaishnavas, to take others across the ocean.\nThe point is not that we imitate their behavior but that we follow their path \u2013 mahajano yena gatah sa pantha \u2013 we follow the path they left behind for us to follow. Nonetheless, that path is the path to pure devotional service \u2013 it\u2019s not anything else. It\u2019s not to karma. It\u2019s not to jnana. It\u2019s not to liberation. In fact, right after Lord Caitanya instructed Rupa Goswami in this verse I just quoted, Lord Caitanya then told Rupa Goswami that devotees are not even interested in sarupya, samipya, or sarsti. They\u2019re not interested even in liberation. They\u2019re not interested even in any of the five kinds of liberation.\nThen Lord Caitanya told Rupa Goswami another verse: \nBhukti-mukti-spriha yavat pisaci hridi vartate\u2026\n(Cc. Madhya 19.176)\n\u201cThe desire to enjoy this material world to its fullest extent and the desire to become liberated from bondage to this material world, they are like two witches which haunt one just like ghosts. As long as these two witches are situated within the heart, how can one experience the bliss of devotional service?\u201d \nAs long as these two witches remain in the heart, it will never be possible to experience the bliss of devotional service. He is talking about the desire for bhukti, which is the desire for enjoyment, and the desire for mukti, the desire for liberation from bondage to this world, which means being liberated from these external designations. In other words, that is also a form of liberation \u2013 simply to become free from designations.\nBut Lord Caitanya qualified that in the previous verse. He said, \u201cThese are by-products.\u201d One doesn\u2019t even have to think about liberation. One will not even think about material enjoyment when he actually engages all of his senses in the service of the Supreme Lord Hrsikesa, who is the master of the senses. Such is the power of devotional service. Such is the power of Krsna consciousness, when one actually deepens his own Krsna consciousness and feels more and more a connection to Krsna by the association of Vaishnavas. The result is that these two witches that haunt one will be ejected from the heart.\nBhakti Vijnana Maharaja, in his opening presentation, talked about the existence of sraddha and the deepening of sraddha. Sraddha means faith in devotional service. It is described in the Caitanya-caritamrta that sraddha means the firm, confident faith that simply by serving the Supreme Lord all other subsidiary duties in connection to the designations of this world are automatically fulfilled. That faith has to grow within the heart. That faith is nourished by associating with Vaishnavas. Bhaktivinode Thakur explains in his Bhakti-tattva-viveka that when faith is awakened within the heart of a living entity it\u2019s just like a birth of newborn baby girl.\nBhakti Vijnana Maharaja gave an example of a person whose initial contact with Krsna consciousness was transformational. Who here can deny that their initial contact, serious contact with Krsna consciousness, was transformational? Anyone who for a moment sincerely comes in contact with a devotee and has the desire awakened within his heart to aspire for his natural state of existence beyond this material world\u2026That one moment is so transformational! That\u2019s why the Bhagavatam states that the value of a moment\u2019s association with a devotee of the Lord cannot be compared to elevation to the heavenly planets, to liberation from matter, or to worldly prosperity. It can\u2019t even be compared to these things. One moment\u2019s association with a pure devotee can\u2019t be compared to thousands of years on the heavenly planets. It can\u2019t even be compared to being liberated from this material world, what to speak of worldly prosperity.\nThe Bhagavatam says, \u201cWhat is the value of a prolonged life which is wasted in experience by so many years in this world? Better one moment in full consciousness because that one moment will enable him to search after his ultimate interest.\u201d (SB 2.1.12) If someone gets that one moment of full consciousness \u2013 \u201cI am a servant of Krsna! I have no connection with this temporary world!\u201d \u2013 that one moment is so liberating! It\u2019s so exhilarating! It\u2019s thrilling! It\u2019s completely transformational! One moment! What is the value of living hundreds of years in this world if you don\u2019t get that one moment? That\u2019s what the Bhagavatam states.\nCertainly, anyone who actually experiences that one moment should be always thinking, \u201cI want to achieve that state all the time. Why just one moment? Why not all the time?\u201d Has anyone ever thought like that? \u201cWhy not all the time? Why do I have to remember that one moment that took place some time in the past?\u201d\nRupa Goswami describes that devotional service is a dynamic process. It\u2019s constantly rendered with the desire to please Krsna \u2013 as Krsna desires. Krsna may say, \u201cPlease, do this.\u201d Then He may say, \u201cPlease, do that.\u201d And we may think, \u201cKrsna, why did You say to do this, but now You\u2019re saying to do that?\u201d Devotional service is as Krsna desires. It\u2019s the service. That\u2019s so satisfying. It\u2019s realizing that \u201cI\u2019m a servant!\u201d\nThat is also so satisfying and so liberating! When that faith is awakened within the heart of the jiva, it\u2019s just like the birth of a newborn baby girl. When a baby girl takes birth, the parents are very careful to protect her from heat, cold, hunger, thirst, dangerous creatures. That baby girl is sraddha, faith, and that sraddha needs to be protected. From what? From the desires for bhukti and mukti. It needs to be protected from the desires for enjoying this material world to the fullest extent and from the knowledge acquired from a monistic conception, the impersonal philosophical conception, that makes the living entity think he wants to be liberated and become one with the Supreme, to become null and void.\nHow can \u201cnull and void\u201d serve the Supreme? When a devotee hears that, it\u2019s like thrusting a dagger into his heart. \u201cHow can I serve Krsna if I don\u2019t exist? How can any such desire ever take root in my heart? It\u2019s my constitutional nature to serve! Why should I ever think for a moment of denying myself that opportunity to serve, favorably, as Krsna desires?\u201d\nJust as the parents protect their baby from these dangerous creatures, in the same way the Vaishnavas who are the guardians of devotional service protect our faith. We have to seek out the association of Vaishnavas who protect our faith in pure devotional service. And even though we may not be able to render pure devotional service \u2013 even though our hearts may still be filled with so many material desires \u2013 the desire to achieve pure devotional service is, in itself, devotional service. That desire should never be lost by bad association or by over-identification with material designations. Therefore, the association of Vaishnavas is so essential.\nVaishnavas not only protect faith\u2026Just as the parents don\u2019t just protect their newborn baby child from dangerous elements. The mother also nourishes the child, gives the child strength. In the same way, the Vaishnavas nourish the devotees. They nourish them with the topics of the devotional service to the Supreme. They nourish their hearts by giving them faith that the state of pure devotional service is achievable as long as we keep a good strong connection with the Vaishnavas. That is the foundation of our faith. If we keep firm, strong connection with the Vaishnavas, they will protect us from the dangers of this material world.\nIn the same way, Srila Prabhupada was always very careful to protect, and continues to very carefully protect, his followers who sincerely follow in his footsteps by always being conscious about his first and foremost instruction \u2013 that we should always be increasing our Krsna consciousness and the Krsna consciousness of others. As he said, \u201c\u2026increasing the Krsna consciousness of the devotees and of ourselves, the senior devotees, the leaders.\u201d If this ever goes out of focus, if we start thinking that expanding is more important than increasing our Krsna consciousness, then we should very carefully examine this instruction of Srila Prabhupada to see if it applies now or at any point in the future. \nThis is the protection that he gave us in the form of his instructions, and this is the association he has given to us in the form of his instructions. If we take shelter of his example and his teachings, and if we always remember the purpose for which he established this Krsna conscious movement \u2013 not simply to increase the number of followers, but to increase the Krsna consciousness of every one of its members \u2013 we will be protected from the illusory energy, and Srila Prabhupada will always leave that boat for us to cross over the ocean of material life.\nThank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n","nid":"6658"},{
"title":"\"About Mother Isa\" - An edited transcription of a talk given on Sunday, September 9, 2012 in Moscow","ref":{"target_id":"5974"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Tue, 2012-11-06 06:02","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"September 9, 2012 - Moscow Sunday Feast - About Mother Isa\nThank you all for coming today for our Sunday feast program. Do we have any guest that we are welcoming today for the first time? I see, there are few of you. Welcome. I am very happy that you were able to come today. I am very happy to be here. I am happy that I was able to come today too. Today I am going to speak on a different topic. Actually, it\u2019s not a different topic, but a different type of presentation. As you can see, there is a screen here. We are going to show something towards the end of our presentation. It will be about ten minutes long, and will be related to the topic about which I am going to speak. \nGenerally, when Vaishnavas depart from this world, it is quite commonplace for devotees to assemble to hear about the activities the departed Vaishnava performed in this world. But, as I said, today it\u2019s a little bit different, because today we are going to speak about a Vaishnava who has not yet departed. And we don\u2019t know when this Vaishnavi will depart. But one thing is for sure: her life is in Krsna\u2019s hands. This devotee lived in the Boston area for many years. The devotees in Boston want to be prepared, for when this Vaishnavi departs from the world, they want to have as many Vaishnavas throughout the world to share their memories about her. She is truly a very unique soul, as you will hear about her tonight. And I have to be honest and admit that actually this woman is one of my siksa-gurus. I have spoken about her many times, because I often times think about her. I find that the more I think about her, the more I meditate on her life and her example, the more my heart becomes free from lust, envy, and greed. And that\u2019s the type of impact that this Vaishnavi has upon me and has upon many. So obviously, if that experience is there, then there must be something very pure about this person. \nAnd purity is a state of being that we all, at least those who are practitioners of Krsna consciousness, are aspiring for. We have been speaking a lot on this topic, about the necessity to become more pure in heart, to become free from all the bad qualities that are manifested in those conditioned by the laws of nature. Especially we have been speaking a lot about envy and the need to overcome the influence of envy in our lives and in our dealings with others. \nIn fact, just this morning we were reading from a commentary by Srila Prabhupada in which he was describing two types of envious beings. He said that one envious being is a snake. And he said that a snake could be pacified by mantras or herbs. But he added that when a person is envious, there is nothing that can pacify him. That is the nature of a person whose heart is filled with envy. Of course, we went on to explain that although there is nothing material that can pacify an envious person, it is certain that purity and the association of a devotee of the Lord \u2013 especially the association of a devotee whose heart is pure \u2013 can eradicate envy even in the heart of the most envious person. \nWe were reading from a verse by Prahlada Maharaja in which he was praying to Lord Nrsimhadeva, \u201cLet all envious persons in this world become pacified by engaging in the process of bhakti-yoga.\u201d And he said, \u201cBecause only then one will be able to genuinely think of the welfare of others.\u201d So this was the prayer of Prahlada Maharaja, praying for all living beings in this world, for their hearts to become pure and to become pacified, free from envy, so that they can think of the welfare of others. \nAs long as there is any trace of envy within the heart, then there are unfulfilled desires. And it is very difficult to think of what is completely beneficial for someone else while one is still thinking about what is beneficial for himself. The whole life of a practitioner of bhakti-yoga is therefore aimed at purification of the heart. The more the heart becomes clean, the more the heart becomes pure, then one becomes satisfied. And a self-satisfied person can actually think of the welfare of others. We oftentimes offer this prayer to Vaishnavas:\nvancha-kalpatarubhyas ca\u2028krpa-sindhubhya eva ca\u2028patitanam pavanebhyo\u2028vaisnavebhyo namo namah\n\u201cWe offer our respectful obeisances unto all the Vaishnava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls.\u201d\n When I think of this Vaishnavi and just meditate on her activities, her life, and her example, I feel that my heart becomes free from unwanted things. There are many other people who have a similar experience of her, not only today but as they knew her many, many years ago. Therefore, for my own purification, I would like to speak about her glories. I hope that by so doing it will attract you also to this devotee and make you aspire for what she has achieved in this life by her own purity. An ordinary materialistic person may look at what she has achieved, which I am going to tell you about tonight, and they may not see anything. They may not be able to understand. Although, I am sure even they would appreciate her simplicity. \nI should probably tell you a little bit more about this person, so that you can have a better understanding of why I am speaking about her. She is my God-sister, an initiated disciple of His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada. Her name is Isa Devi Dasi. Isa is presently ninety-five years old. She joined the Krsna consciousness movement when she was fifty-five. At that time in the early 1970s most people who joined the Krsna consciousness movement were less than half her age. It was very rare for a person her age to join the movement, move into the temple, and engage in full-time devotional service. What to speak of how extraordinary it was for her to live with young people \u2013 to associate with and serve with them. She was like a mother to everybody. It was not easy for her to live under those circumstances. She didn\u2019t have to live in a temple. But she wanted to live in the temple, because she wanted to dedicate her whole life to the service of Srila Prabhupada. \nIn the early 1970s she was living in our New York temple. At that time the BBT, the Bhaktivedanta book Trust, was not yet actually established. It used to be called ISKCON Press. Everything was right there in New York \u2013 all the pre-press work, even the printing, the storage for Prabhupada\u2019s books \u2013 everything was right there in New York. \nIsa\u2019s service was transcription. She would get Prabhupada\u2019s translations and commentaries on tape, and she would be the first person to listen to them and transcribe them. In fact there was a picture of her in our \u201cBack to Godhead\u201d magazine in 1974. She is sitting with her usual bright effulgent smile, and she has huge headphones on, and she is typing as she is listening to Prabhupada\u2019s words. That was her service for some time. But then a little bit later ISKCON Press moved out to Los Angeles. Everything moved and became the \u201cBhaktivedanta Book Trust,\u201d but Isa didn\u2019t go. \nFor some time she was sent to India, where she was serving in our Bombay temple, taking care of Tulasi-devi. I didn\u2019t know Mother Isa at this time. She had been in New York, when I was in Boston. And then, when she went to India\u2026Our paths just didn\u2019t cross. But I finally got to know her when I was the temple president in Boston. I became temple president in 1979. At that time she no longer actually lived in the temple. She lived about a 100 kilometers south of Boston. \nIt was difficult for her to live in the temple. Her body was getting older. The temple couldn\u2019t provide for her personal needs. Because she had a place to live south of Boston, she decided to move there, where she lived alone. She had been previously married to a man who was actually a well-known professor of mathematics in one of the universities in Massachusetts. But he had already died and they had no children. And she was living alone for the latter part of her life. But she would very frequently come to the temple \u2013 as much as she possibly could. She would come and do service in the temple. As I said, I was temple president at that time. She would oftentimes come to the temple and she would report to me. She would tell me about what she was doing at home, and she would tell me about her preaching. \nOne thing Mother Isa always did, and this is the most wonderful quality about her, she wouldn\u2019t speak about anything except Krsna and Prabhupada. I never heard her speak a word of nonsense. I never heard her speak about others in a critical way. Actually, one time she did say something to me about someone else. She said, \u201cI am concerned; he seems to be in maya.\u201d But that was the only thing I ever heard her say about somebody else. She used to come to my office quite frequently. Whenever she would come to Boston, she reported to me. As soon as she entered the temple, if any guests were there, she would immediately start preaching to them. Her preaching was very simple \u2013 very simple, but very pure.\nShe would always carry Hare Krsna mantra cards in her pockets. Whenever she met anybody, she would immediately say, \u201cCan you sing this with me?\u201d She was an elderly woman, so she commanded some respect. So, she did that in the temple, but as I later found out, she did it wherever she was living, wherever she went. She was always carrying some books, some pamphlets, some mantra cards, and she was always approaching people, saying, \u201cPlease, sing this with me.\u201d And then: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then she would look at them and say, \u201cCan you sing it yourself?\u201d People were just so disarmed. They could not say anything\u2026just \u201cHare Krsna\u2026\u201d They would just chant.\nShe especially used to come on Sunday, when all the guests come. If she were here right now, she would probably come to each of you who are here for the first time. She would hand you a card and say, \u201cChant with me.\u201d Whoever she approached, everybody chanted. That is the way she was. \nShe didn\u2019t have any time to talk about anything else. Her preaching was always very, very simple \u2013 but profound. She would say, \u201cKrsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can do anything, because He is the Supreme Lord. If you take shelter of Him, He can do anything. Whatever you need, He can take care of.\u201d She was speaking from her own realization. It was not pretentious. This was her realization because it was very difficult for her to live alone. She did not have much money; she lived very, very simply. She went through many difficulties in her life. She lost many family members. \nShe had one brother, who was older than her. She used to have to take care of him, and he was very antagonistic. She used to come to the temple and tell me, \u201cThat brother of mine, he won\u2019t chant Hare Krsna.\u201d That was her problem: her brother wouldn\u2019t chant Hare Krsna. She also had a niece that was very antagonistic. But she never wanted to accept any help from her family members. She wanted to depend on Krsna. \nShe was living in a city called Hyannis on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. She was effectively the main preacher there. She would always go introducing people to Prabhupada\u2019s books. Everywhere she went she had Prabhupada\u2019s books. She would ride around town on a bicycle. That is how she got everywhere. Whenever she would go into a store to buy something, she would always have some of Prabhupada\u2019s books and some mantra cards. And everyone she met she would always give them books and preach to them. Gradually some people became attracted to her and they wanted to learn more about Prabhupada and Krsna. Whenever there was a group of people that she had been introducing to Krsna consciousness, she would invite me, \u201cPlease come down and give a lecture to these people.\u201d \nSo I used to go down; not that regularly, but once every few months we would go down and have a program. Isa would introduce to me all the people she had met in the course of her travels. Her preaching was just always the same. \u201cKrsna is God. Krsna can do anything. Just take shelter of Him and chant these names.\u201d It was not very complicated. She did not give lectures or anything like that. She just spoke, and then exemplified what she said. That was her life. That is all I know of her life. It was her life just to take shelter of the holy name, to preach the glories of the holy name, and to preach the glories of Prabhupada. She definitely was very much attracted to always speaking about Prabhupada. \nHer life went on like this for quite a few years. And she continued to come to the temple very regularly \u2013 every Sunday. She oftentimes would sew. She liked to sew, so she would sew things for devotees and for the Deities. She liked to make Prabhupada\u2019s hats, because she always saw these hats on Prabhupada in his pictures. When she saw Prabhupada in person, he was wearing his famous \u201cPrabhupada hat\u201d that he would tie under his chin. Every week she came, she would always bring these hats for the brahmacaris and the other devotees in the temple. And bead bags \u2013 she liked to make bead bags. Nobody could refuse. Everybody was wearing Prabhupada hats in the temple. She was the kind of woman you just can\u2019t refuse. If she asked you to take a hat, you had to take it and immediately put it on. She would just immediately smile; it made her so happy. She was so happy, because she was so grateful she could do some service for the devotees. That was her life \u2013 just doing some service according to her means. She wanted to serve the devotees and to serve Radha-Gopivallabha, the Radha-Krsna Deities in Boston. \nAs soon as she came into the temple, She would report to me, telling me about her preaching. Then she would immediately go to shower, put on clean clothes, and go down to the pujari room to iron all the Deities\u2019 clothes. She would iron handkerchiefs, and she would iron the Deity\u2019s cadars and clothes. She would stay in the pujari room until the Sunday feast program was about to start, and then she would go out and preach to the guests. She would preach to the guests all the time during the Sunday program. She would only take a little prasada; she never ate the feast, because she was so busy preaching. She would just honor a little maha-prasada, because she wanted to serve to her full capacity while she was in the temple. Then she would go home. She would take a bus 100 km home late at night every Sunday. \nFrom time to time, she would come during the week, but mostly she came on Sundays. She just continued doing this for so many years. She never complained. I never heard a complaint from this woman\u2019s mouth. She was so happy just to have Prabhupada and Krsna, to be able to associate with the devotees. It was her life. Sometimes people think that when you live away from the devotees, it is very difficult to stay in Krsna consciousness: so many distractions, so many allurements. Sometimes people lament that, \u201cI need to live closer to the devotees.\u201d But she was self-satisfied, and she went on like that for many years. I started travelling on this side of the world many years ago, and so I didn\u2018t see her so often. But I always used to inquire about her. Because I knew her, I knew she was living far away. \nAs the years went by, not many devotees in the temple knew her, especially when it became too difficult for her to come to the temple. But I didn\u2019t want anybody to forget that she exists. So I would always either send an email or call, or whenever I came I would say, \u201cWhere is Mother Isa? How is she doing?\u201d And I would hear, \u201cOh, Mother Isa? We haven\u2019t seen her for a long time.\u201d She was already in her eighties at that time. I would say, \u201cWhat do you mean you haven\u2019t seen her for a long time? What kind of an answer is that? That\u2019s not an answer. I haven\u2019t seen her for a long time. Do you know why you haven\u2019t seen her for a long time?\u201d I always had the biggest fear in my heart that this woman might leave the planet and nobody would know about it. It was always a fear in my heart. It would be a travesty: such an exalted Vaishnavi leaves and nobody knows. So I used to make the devotees find out where was Mother Isa. And they did. \nShe was getting too old to make the bus trip to Boston. But she was still doing whatever she could. She was no longer on a bicycle, but she was still going places, meeting people and introducing them to Krsna consciousness. Actually, it got to the point where it was very difficult for her even to do her basic shopping. She had met one woman in a health food store. Isa was preaching to this woman because she worked in a health food store that Isa would go to quite regularly. Isa would always give her books and preach to her. So, the woman wanted to find out more about Isa, because she was very attracted to Isa. She gradually found out that Isa was living alone, that she was a devotee, a disciple of Srila Prabhupada, and that all she would talk about was Krsna and Prabhupada. This woman began to feel like she wanted to do some service for Mother Isa. She started buying Mother Isa\u2019s food, so that she would not have to go out. This woman was taking care of all Isa\u2019s personal needs. She was so drawn to Isa that she couldn\u2019t help but serve her. I didn\u2019t know about this. But I found out about it in 2006. In 2006 this woman \u2013 she is probably now in her late thirties, maybe forty years old \u2013 she called the Boston temple and left a message on the answering machine. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is the right number to call or not, but I wanted to tell you that there is a woman here in Hyannis, her name is Isa Devi Dasi. She just had a stroke, and she is in a hospital. I thought you may be interested to hear this.\u201d That was the message. She also left her name and phone number. \nUnfortunately, at that time nobody in the temple knew who Isa was. But, fortunately, I was in America at the same time, so I called the temple, and somebody in the temple said, \u201cSomebody left a message about some Isa Devi Dasi who just had a stroke.\u201d I said, \u201cIsa had a stroke? What\u2019s wrong? Where is she? What happened?\u201d \u2013 \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d Immediately, I said, \u201cDid they leave a number?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, they left the number.\u201d So, I immediately called, and Sandy - she introduced herself \u2013 told me about everything that had happened. She said that Isa had had a stroke and was in the hospital. Sandy had found Isa at the bottom of the stairs, where she was lying unconscious. She said that Isa was currently in the hospital, that she was not conscious, but that the doctors were hopeful she would regain consciousness soon. \nAs it turned out, she did regain consciousness very soon. But the result of having had the stroke was that the doctors found out that was one of many strokes she had had. The doctors said that Isa must have had at least five or six strokes before that one. That particular stroke completely took away her memory. She didn\u2018t know who she was; she didn\u2018t know her name; she didn\u2018t know where she lived; she didn\u2018t remember anybody; though, Sandy said, she claimed she remembered me. She also remembered one other devotee \u2013 his name was Damodara \u2013 who also used to serve together with her in the Boston temple. I asked Sandy, \u201cWhere is she? Can I come and see her?\u201d She said, \u201cIt will be better to come see her when she is brought to the rehabilitation hospital. She will be transferred there in two days.\u201d \nSo, in two days I called to see if Sandy was there and if I could meet her and see Isa. Sandy was right there in the room with Isa at that time. She answered the phone. I introduced myself, and she said to Isa, \u201cIsa, it\u2019s Niranjana Swami. Do you remember Niranjana Swami?\u201d Isa didn\u2019t really respond. She gave the phone to Isa and said, \u201cIsa, say something to Niranjana Swami.\u201d\n\u201cHare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna, Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\u201d That\u2019s what she said. And then she handed the phone back to Sandy. She was singing just like that, in that melody, and with great enthusiasm. I said to Sandy, \u201cIt sounds like she hasn\u2019t lost all her memory.\u201d But Sandy said, \u201cIt seems to be that\u2019s all she remembers.\u201d So I said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be all that bad.\u201d \nI went that day to visit her with another devotee. She was there at a rehabilitation hospital, and the doctors were teaching her how to eat \u2013 because she forgot how to eat \u2013 teaching her how to dress, how to walk \u2013 she forgot how to walk. She couldn\u2019t remember any of these things. She had no memory of anything. We waited for some time while she was in therapy. And then finally she was wheeled into the room where we were waiting for her. She had this very intense stare; she was looking at me. I started talking to Mother Isa, \u201cHare Krsna. How are you?\u201d She couldn\u2019t say much. \nAt one point we were sitting and talking to her, we were trying to bring back her memory. One of the nurses came over to Isa, because when you forget, one of the things to do is to try to stimulate a person\u2018s memory. So she sat down in front of Isa \u2013 her name is Edith \u2013 and she said, \u201cEdith, where do you live? Where is your home, Edith?\u201d And Isa says, \u201cMy home? In a very slow, deliberate, but innocent way, she said the word, \"Vrindavan.\u201d The nurse couldn\u2018t understand. She said something like, \u201cI think she said Chicago.\u201d Isa said, \u201cNo. Vrindavan is my home.\u201d That was one thing that really caught my attention. \nThen we were sitting and talking to Isa. She wasn\u2018t really responding so much. Sandy was sitting at the table and we were mostly talking to Sandy, because Isa wasn\u2018t responding so much. Sandy was telling us the story about how she got to know Isa. She told us how Isa came and preached to her in the health food store, how she started serving Isa, and how she was in a conflict with her husband because she was serving Isa more than she was serving the family. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a lot of service. You must be a devotee.\u201d She said, \u201cA devotee? I don\u2018t know what a devotee is. All I know is she talks about Krsna.\u201d And she said, \u201cAll I know is, I love Isa. And if loving Isa means I am a devotee, then I am a devotee.\u201d \nI could see that this woman\u2019s heart was really being transformed by associating with Isa. She was just so dedicated to serving her. She was already making plans, how they could add on to her home so that when Isa got out from the rehabilitation hospital Isa could move in with them so that she could take care of her. They weren\u2018t a very wealthy family, but she was ready to do anything for Isa. Still, the husband he was a little reluctant. And it turned out that the husband started putting up some resistance\u2026 \nThe best part is yet to come. This is leading up to the best part. Do you want me to end? <Devotees say no> Ok, I\u2018ll continue. And I\u2018ll try to not keep you too long from your feast. But don\u2018t forget, Mother Isa would fast. She wouldn\u2018t be so much concerned about the feast. She only wanted to hear and chant about Krsna.\nSo, it was a problem. The husband didn\u2018t want Isa to move into their home. Sandy was explaining all this to us. All of a sudden another nurse walked over to the table, and Isa looked up and she sternly asked, \u201cAre you a vegetarian?\u201d And Sandy started clapping, \u201cThat\u2018s the Isa I know.\u201d She was so happy. Immediately she said, \u201cIsa is coming back. That\u2018s the Isa I know. She is always preaching.\u201d Meanwhile, the nurse was just startled. She didn\u2018t know what to say. She said, \u201cWell, I try not to eat red meat.\u201d Isa wasn\u2018t satisfied. She just gave a dirty look, but she didn\u2018t say anything more. Damodara had to explain to her about the benefits of being vegetarian. The woman left, saying, \u201cWell, I am going to think seriously about becoming vegetarian now.\u201d \nSo, we went back into Isa\u2018s room, and there was another devotee\u2026Actually, this was another visit, not the same visit. Isa was already in the room when I came with another devotee. Isa was staring at this devotee as he was chanting japa; she was staring at his bead bag. I asked Sandy, \u201cWhere are her beads? Does she have beads?\u201d Sandy said, \u201cActually, no. Her beads broke when she fell down the stairs during her stroke. She has no beads.\u201d She said, \u201cBut my husband is restringing them for her.\u201d But Mother Isa was still looking at the bead bag. Although we were trying to get her to communicate, she just wouldn\u2018t take her eyes away from the bead bag. So the devotee, Yamuna Jivana, gave his bead bag to Isa. Isa looked like a little child who had just received a Christmas present she had been waiting for all year. She put her hand into the bead bag immediately and just started chanting, \u201cHare Krsna, Hare Krsna\u2026\u201d She didn\u2018t notice anything else that was going on in the room. She just stayed that way for the whole rest of the visit, just chanting japa, as if she had been waiting such a long time for those beads.\nUnfortunately, that was the last time I saw Isa until just two weeks ago. But I arranged for a whole group of devotees to rotate and go visit her from time to time. After a while I found out they were becoming a little negligent, and nobody was visiting her. So, just on my last trip to the United States I took two other devotees with me, and we went down to the nursing home where she is now. We tried very hard to find a way that Mother Isa could live with devotees, so that devotees could take care of her. But it was very, very difficult. I knew that Mother Isa had some funds, because one time she called me and asked for my name \u2013 she wanted to put my name into her will so that all her money would be given to me when she died. \nSo, I asked Sandy, because Sandy took responsibility for her accounts also, how much money was available? Maybe we could build a house in one of the farm communities, and the devotees could take care of her. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2018t very much. But, even worse, her niece refused to let her be taken away. Her niece had full custody of Isa, because she was the only living relative. They wouldn\u2018t let us take her to any place far from where she had been living. \nWe went to the nursing home. I hadn\u2018t seen Mother Isa for five or six years. She was wheeled into the room. I could see that she was a lot older. When I talked to her she was a lot less responsive. Her memory was practically completely gone. When I would talk to her, I would say, \u201cIsa, tell me something about Prabhupada. Tell me something about Krsna.\u201d She would just look at me very intensely \u2013 in the eyes \u2013 but she couldn\u2018t say anything. So, I decided to go to the nurses\u2019 station to ask them if they could tell me about her current state. I told them who I was and how I had known her for almost forty years. I was told at the nurses\u2019 station that actually the morning is a very bad time of day to get her to respond because she is very, very tired. The nurse said, \u201cBut if you come during the day, she\u2018ll sing the Krsna song for you.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, really?\u201d Immediately I became enlivened, because I knew she was still chanting. I couldn\u2018t imagine Mother Isa not chanting Hare Krsna. So, I went back into the room again and I reached out for her hand, and she immediately grabbed my hand very tightly. \nI said, \u201cMother Isa, Hare Krsna.\u201d And she looked at me and said, \u201cHare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna\u2026\u201d She chanted the whole mantra all the way through. She did this for several minutes. But we couldn\u2018t get her to say anything else but the maha-mantra. That\u2018s all she could say. We could see that she was very tired, so we decided after forty-five minutes that we would leave and try to come back some time in the afternoon. \nAs we were leaving the nursing home, one of the nurses saw me out of the corner of her eye \u2013 I was dressed in my robes \u2013 she was helping a group of elderly people to get into a van. She came over to me and said, \u201cWho are you here to see?\u201d So I said, \u201cI am here to see Edith Graves.\u201d She said, \u201cI knew it. I love that woman. Everybody in this whole building loves that woman. She\u2018s the most peaceful person, so self contented. She never complains. Every Friday we get together and we sing patriotic songs together. And she leads everybody in a Krsna song.\u201d The whole group of people, she just starts leading them in kirtana. She just chants Hare Krsna, and everybody just follows along and chants with her.\nThere was another elderly woman in a wheelchair. She was being wheeled onto the van. She immediately put her hand out and she said, \u201cVery nice to meet you. My name is Kay. I love that woman too. That woman is a real live wire. When she starts chanting that Krsna song with such enthusiasm, everybody just has to chant. Everybody has to sing with her. Tell me, how old is she? Nobody knows how old she is.\u201d I said, \u201cShe is ninety-five years old.\u201d She said, \u201cOh.\u201d Maybe she became very reverential when she heard that Isa was ninety-five years old. She begged us, \u201cPlease come back again.\u201d And the other nurse said, \u201cPlease come back. You have to come and see her. Nobody has been visiting her.\u201d So I thanked them profusely, and I told them, \u201cThank you for sharing these stories about Isa with me. It means so much to me. We\u2018ll definitely come back.\u201d \nSo the devotee that came with me, it just so happened that he had to be near there on that Friday afternoon. So I told him, \u201cYou have to take a camera. I want you to take a video of Mother Isa chanting. Then you should interview everybody and ask them what they think about her.\u201d As it turned out, there was a strict policy in the nursing home not to allow events to be videotaped. They obviously don\u2019t allow anybody to go around and interview people on video. But this devotee took some video clips of Mother Isa chanting. She can\u2018t say anything from memory, except the Hare Krsna mantra. Sometimes she may repeat a word or two, but it\u2018s just repetition. But as soon she starts with the Hare Krsna mantra, it just comes out with such enthusiasm, with such devotion \u2013 it\u2018s profound. \nI\u2019m thinking that Krsna has taken away everything, but she has everything she needs for a perfect life. She doesn\u2018t have to think about her body, she doesn\u2018t complain about anything, she doesn\u2018t have to think about anything, because the only thing she can think about is the holy name. It\u2018s the only thing that comes out of her mouth. I tried to get something else, but nothing else would come, just the Holy name. So, I\u2019m thinking that Krsna, who is in the heart, has actually rewarded her for a life of only speaking about Krsna. \nI wrote the story and I put it on the internet, and devotees are writing back and leaving little comments. Sivarama Maharaja says, \u201cIf having a stroke means that all I\u2019ll be able to say is Hare Krsna, then maybe I should have a stroke.\u201d Other devotees are writing things like this, \u201cWonderful! It\u2018s amazing! All glories to Prabhupada! This is shocking!\u201d \nNow we are going to show this video. It\u2018s ten minutes. But I want you to take note what she does when the woman who is with her tries to get her to chant. When she chants, the woman and Syamarupa both say, \u201cThat\u2018s wonderful, Mother Isa.\u201d Watch the expression on her face when they say, \u201cThat\u2018s wonderful, Mother Isa.\u201d It\u2018s the same expression she would always show when everybody would try to glorify her. Because she never wanted glorification. She would always think nothing of it. She didn\u2019t want to hear it. So when you hear, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d watch her expression. The other thing\u2026towards the end you\u2018ll see such an effulgent smile. It will melt your heart. For me, it brings tears to my eyes, because she is my siksa-guru. She has always been an object of my meditation. \nSo, I\u2019d like to introduce you to Mother Isa. Hare Krsna.\n \n","nid":"6265"},{
"title":"Edited Transcription of a Talk to the Brahmacaris (Entitled \"Wisdom Through Renunciation\") in Chowpatty on February 7, 2012","ref":{"target_id":"4856"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Tue, 2012-10-16 00:20","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"February 7, 2012 - Chowpatty - Talk to Brahmacaris - \"Wisdom Through Renunciation\"\nToday\u2019s topic is wisdom through renunciation.\nJust before I came here, I looked up the definition of wisdom. The dictionary definition. \n[Aside] Do we have translators here? Does he speak Russian?\nThe dictionary definition \u2013 it\u2019s interesting \u2013 was \u201cthe quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment.\u201d That\u2019s a dictionary definition of wisdom. I thought it was relevant.\nAlthough it can certainly be explained\u2026All three\u2026Experience, knowledge, and good judgment can all be explained with Krsna conscious descriptions. But renunciation made me think of this verse. As I was walking over, I suggested to Govinda to get me the 11th Canto of the Bhagavatam. I like to quote this verse often because it helps us to understand how detachment or renunciation awakens to devotional service. And this is the verse:\nbhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir\nanyatra caisa trika eka-kalah\nprapadyamanasya yathasnatah syus\ntustih pustih ksud-apayo 'nu-ghasam\n\u201cDevotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from other things \u2013 these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way as pleasure, nourishment, and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly with each bite for a person engaged in eating.\u201d (Bhagavatam 11.2.42)\nDoes anyone know this verse? No? It\u2019s an important verse. Prabhupada would quote it. Prabhupada would explain it in terms of how \u2013 in the same way that the verse describes \u2013 devotion increases, detachment increases, and experience of Krsna increases to the degree that one is engaged in devotional service. Or, as we also often quote:\nanasaktasya visayan\nyatharham upayunjatah\nnirbandhah krsna-sambandhe\nyuktah vairagyam ucyate (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.255)\n\u201cOne who renounces things without understanding their relationship with Krsna is not as complete in his renunciation as one who sees everything connected to Krsna and uses this in His service.\u201d\nPrabhupada emphasized that for a Vaishnava real renunciation means everything is for Krsna. That is real renunciation. Therefore, when we talk about renunciation and the wisdom acquired through renunciation, although it would be nice if we could simply limit the discussion to those who are in the renounced order (brahmacaris and sannyasis), Prabhupada was very emphatic that renunciation could be actually performed by anyone in any stage of life, whether he is brahmacari, grihastha, vanaprastha, or sannyasi. In fact, there is a very wonderful commentary Prabhupada gives to the bhajan \u201cGaurangera Duti Pada.\u201d At the end of the commentary he cites, or gives the definition or the translation of the last verse, that if you are part of\u2026Whether you are grihastha, vanaprastha, brahmacari, or sannyasi, it does not make any difference. \u201cIf you are simply engaged in Lords Caitanya\u2019s sankirtana movement,\u201d he says, \u201cthen I want your association, I want to be in your association.\u201d \nPrabhupada emphasizes this point. In fact, even in the same commentary he says that the sankirtana movement means the householders should come together and absorb themselves in sankirtana, glorification of Krsna. He says, \u201cThe householders can do it.\u201d And he says, \u201cEven sannyasis can do it.\u201d That\u2019s what he says. You can look it up. It\u2019s interesting \u2013 \u201ceven sannyasis.\u201d Of course he was saying\u2026Because generally we think sannyasis are those who go to the forest. But he was emphasizing that to be completely absorbed in sankirtana, hearing and chanting, to be absorbed in glorifying the Holy name, qualities, form, and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, then in whatever status of life one is in, that is renunciation. \nAnd of course there is a pastime in the Caitanya Bhagavata, when Lord Caitanya is testing Srivasa Thakura. He tells him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you become a sannyasi? Why don\u2019t you renounce? You are not making any effort to maintain your family.\u201d And Srivasa says, \u201cNo. It is not possible to do that.\u201d And then Srivasa explains what would happen if he\u2026He claps his hands three times, and Lord Caitanya asks him, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this clapping your hands three times?\u201d And Srivasa says, \u201cOne, two, three.\u201d <Guru Maharaja claps three times> \u201cIf after three times all the necessities are not available for my family, then I will simply tie a rope around my neck and drown myself in the Ganga.\u201d And then Lord Caitanya says, \u201cWhat are you saying, Srivasa? Don\u2019t you remember, what I said in Bhagavad-Gita?\u201d \ntesam nityabhiyuktanam\nyoga-ksemam vahamy aham\n(Gita 9.22)\nLord Caitanya said, \u201cI will personally carry on My head all the necessities that you need. I\u2019ll bring them directly to your door.\u201d He said, \u201cNot only you and your family but even the animals in your home, the dogs and cats, will have all their necessities.\u201d \nAnd we understand that Lord Caitanya took that position to again emphasize the point that Srivasa was so renounced that, for the pleasure of the Lord, he was ready to sacrifice everything \u2013 even the loss of his son. In this pastime they are having kirtan in the house of Srivasa Thakura. And then one night, during the kirtan, Srivasa\u2019s son left his body and all of his relatives were lamenting. And Srivasa could observe the lamentation that was taking place. He asked, \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d And they said, \u201cJust recently your son left his body.\u201d And then he told everyone in the house, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The Lord is here in my house. He is having kirtan, and He is experiencing the highest ecstasy. We cannot disturb His ecstasy. We cannot show any lamentation whatsoever in His presence. Otherwise His ecstasy will be disturbed. His pleasure will be disturbed.\u201d He told them, \u201cKeep it within your hearts, and forget the loss of my son.\u201d So, the kirtan continued, and everybody of course tried to keep it within their hearts, but because Lord Caitanya is omniscient and knows what is in everyone\u2019s heart, even what they kept within their hearts was not hidden from the Lord. And then, after some time, Lord Caitanya said, \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s happened? Has something happened here?\u201d And then they finally came out and disclosed what had happened, that Srivasa\u2019s son had departed. But later Lord Caitanya disclosed to Srivasa, \u201cHow can I ever give up the association of one who, for My pleasure, doesn\u2019t even know lamentation for the loss of his own son?\u201d And then Lord Caitanya told him that, \u201cBoth Myself and Nityananda will become your sons.\u201d\nOf course there is more to that pastime, but the point is that we should not think the wisdom derived from renunciation is exclusive to those who wear saffron cloth. The evidence from Lord Caitanya\u2019s pastimes makes it clear that real renunciation means everything is for the service of the Lord, and that such renunciation can be achieved in any status of life.\nanasritah karma-phalam\nkaryam karma karoti yah\nsa sannyasi ca yogi ca\nna niragnir na cakriyah\n\u201cOne who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no duty.\u201d (Gita 6.1)\nSrila Prabhupada would oftentimes quote that verse also to emphasize renunciation. And Prabhupada, in his lectures again and again, would always speak about his householder disciples and how they were doing even more than some of his sannyasi Godbrothers were able to do. \nBut I won\u2019t get into it, by which I mean that I thought I should start with this. But all of you are aware of it. Fortunately, you have been properly trained, so you understand not to become proud of your status as brahmacaris, to become proud of your renunciation, and to think that only those who are brahmacaris or sannyasis hold the key to the mysteries of renunciation. Nonetheless, since we are speaking to a group of brahmacaris? \nYes? <Guru Maharaja laughs> There is one [grhasta] hiding in the corner there. <Everyone laughs> I told him, \u201cIf you think you\u2019re renounced, you can come.\u201d The beginning of the class was for you, Syam Gopal. <Guru Maharaja laughs>\nbhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir\nanyatra caisa trika eka-kalah\u2026\n\u201cDevotion, direct experience of God, and detachment from other things \u2013 these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishment, and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite, for a person engaged in eating.\u201d (Bhagavatam 11.2.42)\nWe often times give the example that, when a person is eating, he doesn\u2019t have to ask somebody else, \u201cIs my hunger going away?\u201d <Guru Maharaja laughs> This is usually true. I remember once giving the example before. I think it was here. Once I used that example, and one brahmacari said that he never gets full and he doesn\u2019t know\u2026 <Everyone laughs> He said he usually doesn\u2019t know when to stop eating. <Everyone laughs> \nI don\u2019t think that he was trying to argue with the example. But I thought back, and I remembered that, in the early days, when I joined in Boston in 1973, we had very, very simple prasada. We didn\u2019t have much money in those days. All we were given was literally three chickpeas \u2013 three chickpeas with ginger and turmeric. Sometimes four. If you were lucky. We counted out three on a piece of wax paper \u2013 three chickpeas, a quarter of an orange, and oatmeal. All on wax paper because we couldn\u2019t afford plates. And the oatmeal was always hot. It would always melt the wax, so we would have waxy oatmeal every morning. Every morning, that\u2019s all we ate \u2013 summer, spring, fall, winter. That was it. That was breakfast. And lunch was generally potatoes and bread. But when the Sunday Feast came\u2026 <Everyone laughs>\nWe had amazing Sunday feasts. We always had strawberry and blueberry sweet rice, halava, pakoras, two or three subjis, a nectar drink\u2026And everybody could eat as much as they wanted. So the brahmacaris used to defy this principle. There was no question of getting full. <Everyone laughs> \u201cFull\u201d was not a word. The word \u201cfull\u201d did not exist in the English vocabulary when it came to the Sunday Feast. We would eat mountains, plates and plates, and then we would go upstairs to the brahmacari ashram\u2026All you could hear was groaning: \u201cUhhh, uhhh.\u201d <Everyone laughs> The whole floor was covered with brahmacaris, lying down, just rolling from one side to the other and trying to find a position they could lie in so that it wasn\u2019t too painful. <Everyone laughs> I\u2019m not joking. This is what it was like. We didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u201cfull.\u201d It was incomprehensible. You just ate until you dropped. <Everyone laughs>\nAnybody ever have that experience?\n<Devotees answer> \u201cYeah!!!\u201d <Everyone laughs>\nAnd we always used to say, quoting Prabhupada from the early days, once when he was serving out prasada. Prabhupada said, \u201cYou should eat until you waddle like a duck.\u201d That was the standard quote. \nBut generally, when a person is eating, he knows when he is getting full. And he doesn\u2019t have to ask somebody else, \u201cAm I getting full?\u201d Except this one brahmacari. He said, \u201cI never know whether I am eating enough or not. I have to ask somebody else. Otherwise I will just keep on eating and eating.\u201d <Everyone laughs>\nDevotee says: Maharaja\u2026(inaudible)\nMaharaja: You have someone like that here too? Who is that? <Everyone laughs>\nDevotee says: (inaudible) <Everyone laughs>\nAnother devotee: (inaudible) \nMaharaja: I didn\u2019t hear what he said. What did he say?\nDevotee: I\u2019m always full\nMaharaja says: \u201cI\u2019m always full.\u201d That means you never eat! <Everyone laughs>\nOne who is full is satisfied, and he doesn\u2019t have to eat. Although\u2026Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives an analogy in the Tenth Canto of the pain that the residents of Vrindavana had to undergo because of the torrential downpour sent by Indra; he compares their pain to hunger. He says that, just like when a person is hungry he has a better understanding of what it\u2019s like to be satisfied when he is full, so in the same way the residents of Vrindavana experienced so much pain from the torrential rains that the satisfaction they got from seeing Krsna for seven days continuously underneath Govardhana Hill was far most satisfying. [Seeing Krsna was more satisfying] because of the hunger that they had before, [because of the] pain from inundation.\nIf you are always full, it\u2019s good to feel hunger sometimes. It increases the pleasure of being full. When a person is eating, he experiences the pleasure from eating, he experiences the strength that he gets from eating, and he sees that his hunger is going away. Generally, in most cases it is going away. <Maharaja laughs> Therefore, this verse compares that to the experience of devotional service. One knows he is engaged in devotional service when he experiences that his devotion is increasing. When he is getting direct experience of Krsna in his life \u2013 seeing Krsna\u2019s hand manifesting in his life, seeing Krsna\u2019s presence more and more, and seeing how ultimately Krsna is controlling everything. And also when he sees that he is losing his attraction for material things. In these three ways he knows his devotion is increasing. That is the test. Prabhupada says it\u2019s a litmus test. If you want to test to see if you are advancing, then this is the test that your devotion is increasing. \nDevotional service is also described here in the purport we will read. Srila Jiva Goswami has explained this analogy as follows, \u201cBhakti or devotion may be compared to tusti, satisfaction, because they both take the form of pleasure.\u201d In other words, devotional service is such an enjoyable process that one automatically becomes renounced.\niha yasya harer dasye\nkarmana manasa gira\nnikhilasv apy avasthasu\njivan-muktah sa ucyate\n(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.187)\nFor one who is engaged in devotional service with his body, mind, and words, he is a liberated soul even within this body. He is liberated because devotional service is liberated activity. It is the higher pleasure.\nvisaya vinivartante\nniraharasya dehinah\nrasa-varjam raso 'py asya\nparam drstva nivartate\n\u201cThe embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.\u201d (Gita 2.59) \nRenunciation is automatically achieved. \nvasudeve bhagavati\nbhakti-yogah prayojitah\njanayaty asu vairagyam\njnanam ca yad ahaitukam\n\u201cBy rendering devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.\u201d (Bhagavatam 1.2.7)\nOf course, the real key is how to experience pleasure in devotional service. And for those aspiring to maintain renunciation, they must learn how to derive their pleasure, their satisfaction, in this way. As Jiva Goswami says, bhakti and tusti are the same. Tusti means \u201csatisfaction.\u201d Bhakti means \u201cdevotional service.\u201d And they both derive their taste from the same source: \nmac-citta mad-gata-prana\nbodhayantah parasparam\u2026\nAs Krsna says, \u201cThe thoughts of my pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are fully surrendered to My service, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss from always enlightening one another and conversing about Me.\u201d (Gita 10.9)\nThey derive this satisfaction from associating with devotees. They are always very eager to be in the association of devotees, especially those devotees who help them to increase their appreciation for all the wonderful things that Srila Prabhupada gave us. Prabhupada gave us such a simple life, such wonderful gifts. If we can be satisfied with the simplicity of Krsna consciousness, then we are very fortunate. \nI remember one time\u2026And I say this, not because I mean it to be a prophecy or anything of that nature. It was something that Tamal Krsna Maharaja told me, and it meant a lot to me. I think it was 1979 or 1980, in Mayapur. At that time I was a brahmacari, and Tamal Krsna Maharaja was revered. It was just two or three years after Prabhupada departed, and we all thought that if somebody was as close with Prabhupada as Tamala Krsna Maharaja was, then he was a very confidential servant. Throughout the movement he was seen as somebody who was really close with Prabhupada. So, when he said this to me, it meant a lot to me. \nWe were sitting and taking prasada in Mayapur together. I happened to be sitting next to him. And, I don\u2019t know, somehow I think he must have remembered me from 1976, because he had been GBC in Boston. In 1976 Prabhupada sent him to become the GBC after our previous GBC had left. I was a brahmacari in the Boston temple distributing books at that time. I had had a few exchanges with him. \nI used to lead a lot of kirtans. In fact, once, when we were installing Gaura-Nitai in Boston, he performed the installation ceremony. He came over to me and said, \u201cDo you know this melody?\u201d And he sang one melody. It is an old, old melody from the very early days. You all probably don\u2019t even known it. \n<Maharaja sings> \u201cHare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama\u2026\u201d So he asked me if I knew it. And I said I did. So he said, \u201cPlay that melody. Don\u2019t stop, and don\u2019t play any other melody.\u201d The installation went on for about two to three hours. Maybe that\u2019s how he remembered me. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask. \nSo, in 1979 we were sitting in Mayapur, taking prasada, and he turned to me and said, \u201cPrabhupada would be very pleased with you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat did I do, Maharaja?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause you like what Prabhupada gave us.\u201d And that\u2019s all. He said, \u201cYou like chanting, you like his books, you like prasada\u2026\u201d I guess he was noticing how much I was enjoying the prasada\u2026 <Maharaja laughs> Then he said, \u201cPrabhupada just gave us such simple things. Prabhupada would smile.\u201d And I said, \u201cThank you, Maharaja. That means a lot to me.\u201d \nAt that time, at that particular stage of my life, I just took that as a very important point to learn; Prabhupada was pleased by our appreciating the simple things that he gave us. I took it as a sign that Prabhupada was pleased\u2026because Tamal Krsna Maharaja was telling me that. \nI saw it as a key to how we can be protected in spiritual life by just appreciating the simple things that Prabhupada gave us. You don\u2019t have to complicate it. Sometimes things do get a little complicated \u2013 beyond what we expect. Sometimes I even find myself asking the question, \u201cHow did I get into this situation with all these complications?\u201d For those who don\u2019t have to complicate their lives, it is extremely beneficial to maintain a sense of renunciation by just relishing the simple things that Prabhupada gave us, including prasada. <Everyone laughs>\nThere is nothing wrong with that. Prabhupada once said to Brahmananda, \u201cIf you can digest a hundred capatis\u2026\u201d <Everyone laughs> \nDevotee speaks: \u201cHe can digest fifty\u201d\nMaharaja: Huh? <Everyone laughs>\nDevotee: (inaudible) \nMaharaja: If you can digest it, then all glories to you. <Everyone laughs>\nRelish prasada. Relish honoring prasada in the association of devotees. Relish distributing prasada also. Personally, I find distributing prasada extremely relishable. Of course it says in Guruvastakam, catur-vidha-sri-bhagavat-prasada\u2026Nonetheless, we should always be satisfied to see others relishing prasada. And therefore, if you derive great pleasure by giving prasada to others\u2026 \ndadati pratigrhnati\nguhyam akhyati prcchati\n(Nectar of Instruction 4)\nGiving prasada, accepting prasada \u2013 these are Vaisnava loving exchanges. This is an important verse for renunciation also. Rupa Goswami is giving the standard of friendship in Krsna consciousness. This friendship is based upon sharing, upon giving love to others. Bhaktivinoda Thakur explains in Sri Bhaktyaloka, where He says that these exchanges, when done in the association of devotees, are done with affection and love.\nHe says that sometimes we may give food to a non-devotee, but then we should withhold our affection. We should do it out of duty. Therefore he gives the example of householders, who sometimes out of duty have to feed others. When they associate with non-devotees, they do not inquire confidentially. They do not freely give love. They withhold their affection. \nIn the association of devotees, there is love, there is affection. There is affection when one gives something very valuable to another devotee. In fact there is a verse that says one of the qualities of a brahmana is that he should be able to give whatever he possesses to others. Prabhupada quotes the verse in one of his commentaries. There are twelve qualities of a brahmana. He is detached, humble, and tolerant. He is not envious. He must be able to give whatever he has to others in charity. He must be learned in the scriptures and fixed in devotional service \u2013 perfectly religious. These are some of the qualities of a brahmana. \nWhen we give something to another devotee, he accepts it, because it is offered with love. That completes the exchange \u2013 when it is accepted. The simple act of honouring prasada, giving prasada, revealing our minds in confidence, inquiring confidentially, giving gifts, accepting gifts\u2026These are very valuable devotional experiences that enhance our devotional service and increase our attachment to the association of devotees. Because we know that the more our attachment to Krsna and Krsna\u2019s devotes increases\u2026\nprasangam ajaram pasam\natmanah kavayo viduh\nsa eva sadhusu krto\nmoksa-dvaram apavrtam\n(Bhagavatam 3.25.20)\nEvery learned person knows that attachment to material things is a cause of bondage for the living entity. But when that same attachment is applied to self-realized devotees, then \u2013 moksa-dvaram apavrtam \u2013 the gate to liberation is open. \nSo, in that sense, real renunciation actually means attachment. That is our renunciation. To the degree that we become attached to and relish these simple activities of Krsna consciousness, then to that degree\u2026 \nWhat will happen? Well, we are supposed to talk about wisdom through renunciation. That is the topic, right? And we defined wisdom as having experience, knowledge, and good judgment. Actually, all these things could be applied. Wisdom, or experience, is certainly attained by consistently acting in a renounced way for a period of time. \nIn other words, some persons may appear to be immediately renounced\u2026 \nVisvanatha Cakravati Thakur actually explains in Madhurya Kadambini that renunciation can happen immediately as a result of the powerful preaching of a devotee in this life, or it can happen as a result of experience in a previous life. Either way, one actually has to achieve this stage of renunciation \u2013 either through the powerful preaching of a Vaisnava in this life, or through some contact with a Vaisnava in a previous life. In this way it may sometimes appear that someone in this life becomes immediately very renounced, but such renunciation is simply due to contact in a previous life. \nOf course this is only true if that person stays renounced. That is a key; the key is to stay renounced. And that requires wisdom \u2013 to remain renounced, to be very careful, and to practice good judgment. That is wisdom. Included within wisdom is to practice good judgment, which means that we have to learn how to discriminate what is favorable from what is not favorable. We know that we must accept everything favorable and reject everything unfavorable. But this is not the same as the accepting and rejecting of the mind, which is known as bhoga-tyaga. Accepting and rejecting those things that are favorable or unfavorable for devotional service is done on the basis of what will please or displease the spiritual master. \nPrabhupada said the same thing, during a lecture in Mayapur in 1976. He gave a definition of renunciation. He asked, \u201cWhat is our renunciation?\u201d And he gave the definition. He said that we don\u2019t need to sit in a circle of fire in the middle of summer. He said that our renunciation is not to sit in freezing cold water in the middle of the winter. He said, \u201cThis is not the type of austerity or renunciation that one needs to perform. Our austerity, our renunciation is to strictly follow the instructions of the spiritual master.\u201d This is from a lecture Prabhupada gave in 1976 in Mayapur. I remember it because I happened to be there at the time. I can\u2019t remember which lecture it was. It might have been the sannyasa lecture he gave in 1976, when he gave some devotees sannyasa initiation. \nSo that is our renunciation. We simply follow the instructions of our spiritual master very strictly. Therefore we should be thinking \u2013 accepting and rejecting. We accept that which is favorable for devotional service by following the instructions we have been given. And we reject that which is not favorable to those same instructions. That requires good judgment. The quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment \u2013 that is wisdom. And that can automatically develop in a person who uses his discrimination to practice the type of renunciation we have described. \nSo far I haven\u2019t read much of the commentary. There is more to be said about tyaga, or renunciation, so maybe I should read it. I said how bhakti\u2026Is there a time limit? I should leave time for questions too. If I read the whole purport, it will take us almost to the end. I will just read about tyaga. \n\u201cThe word virakti is very significant in this verse. Virakti means \u2018detachment,\u2019 whereas tyaga means \u2018renunciation.\u2019 According to Srila Bhaktisidhanta Sarasvati Thakur, the word \u2018renunciation\u2019 can be used in a situation in which one considers giving up an enjoyable object. But by considering everything to be potential paraphernalia in the service of Lord Krsna, as described in the previous verse, one need not give a thought to renunciation, for one uses everything in the proper way in the service of the Lord, yuktah vairagyam ucyate.\u201d \nWe have to be very careful how we interpret this. Obviously, someone may be very convinced \u2013mistakenly convinced \u2013 that he desires to have something only for the service of the Lord, but Rupa Goswami is very expert and therefore includes prayasa, or over-endeavor, as one of the things that can cause us to fall down. Although we may be convinced that we need something for the service of the Lord, we should be very careful that we do not over-endeavor in our efforts to obtain that which we think we need. The point here is that one need not consider giving up an enjoyable object if he understands that the object is meant not for his own enjoyment but rather for Krsna\u2019s pleasure.\nDoes anybody have questions or comments about anything I\u2019ve discussed? \nDevotee: Maharaja, from a devotional point of view\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter which ashram we are in, because ultimately the sankirtana movement is the main thing. Therefore many devotees in our movement carry on with renunciation in married life. What is it that convinces them\u2026Does it offer them more facility for sankirtanta, or\u2026Because, if same thing is there, then what is it that makes one special, or not special\u2026Of course we shouldn\u2019t call it that because it may lead to pride, but is there something that is more inspiring for the people who are in this asrama\u2026Is there something that makes it more beneficial for our ultimate goal. Or is just because of one\u2019s nature that they just continue like that?\nNRS: Your question is why would a brahmacari stay a brahmacari if he can be renounced in any status of life?\nDevotee: Yes.\nNRS: Why be distracted? <Maharaja laughs> If he is already satisfied, then why would a brahmacari want the distractions that accompany householder life? Why take the chance? Of course the risk is there in either situation. Brahmacaris are also at risk. They are declaring war on the illusory energy. But if one is genuinely deriving satisfaction from the simple activities of chanting, hearing, accepting prasada, giving prasada\u2026If his life is so satisfying because of such simplicity, then why would he think of potentially distracting himself by having to get involved in something besides those activities? That in itself is enough to question why one should bother getting married. There is no need. Nonetheless, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta has said that in the age of Kali, brahmacaris will stay brahmacaris because household life is too difficult. <Everyone laughs> That is not a reason to stay a brahmacari. <Everyone laughs> \nSomebody who is thinking like that \u2013 \u201cPhew! Householder life is just too difficult. Why would I even think of becoming a householder? Just think about all those difficulties! I don\u2019t want to become a householder.\u201d \u2013 he is spending all his time thinking about how much more difficult his life would be if he were a householder. \nSomeone like that won\u2019t relish hari-katha. He won\u2019t relish associating with the other brahmacaris. He won\u2019t relish the kirtan or the holy name. He won\u2019t relish anything, because his mind is absorbed in how he is trying to avoid all those difficulties. He is just trying to hold on. That is not brahmacarya. That is just holding on. It is not deepening your attachment to those things connected to Krsna. The point is, if you are actually attached to these things and you are deriving satisfaction from them, then why the need for distraction? There is no need. \nOf course, sometimes there are unique situations. For instance, Lord Brahma and Svayambhuva Manu both requested Priyavrata Maharaja to take up family life for the sake of increasing the population of the universe. Therefore Narada, who had instructed Priyavrata Maharaja to remain a brahmacari, agreed that for him family life was more important. So, yes, under certain circumstances family life may be necessary. And if one does it in the spirit of renunciation, then\u2026We can see the good example of Priyavrata Maharaja. He remembered all of Narada Muni\u2019s instructions. \nBut, then again, there are the Haryasvas and the Savalasvas. Prajapati Daksa instructed them to become householders, but Narada Muni said, \u201cWhy should you get distracted?\u201d And he preached to them, instructing them to follow the path of nivrtti-marga. Does that answer your question? <Maharaja laughs>\nDevotee: Hare Krsna. Thank you, Maharaja. I have one question about the last part of the class. You mentioned about prayasa. You were saying how, if you are not very advanced, then prayasa could lead to fall-down. We have also heard how Krsna protects His devotees when they are serving Him. I am wondering, where is that line? When are we over-endeavoring. As brahmacaris in particular, when are we over-endeavoring? Because we have so many services, we can never stop. And we want to serve. But when is it over-endeavoring? How do I know that I am over-endeavoring and it is prayasa? \nNRS: Over-endeavoring, according to the definition of prayasa, means over-endeavoring for mundane achievements that are difficult to obtain. What you are describing is not \u201cover-endeavoring.\u201d Quote, unquote.\nDevotee: OK. That clarifies, actually. I was thinking that I am very enthusiastic when I am doing a lot of things. But then sometimes I also know about prayasa. So I try to check myself. But now you have clarified: If I am aspiring for some mundane achievement, then it is prayasa.\nNRS: Yes, over-endeavoring for mundane achievements that are difficult to obtain \u2013 that is prayasa. Also included is overeating. <Everyone laughs> But he digests them, so it is not overeating. <Everyone laughs and claps> But sometimes we may be over-endeavoring in the execution of our duties. That is true. We may be over-endeavoring. And if we are not careful, we may burn ourselves out. Obviously, to avoid this requires proper discrimination and good judgment. It also requires good association. The tendency for a person to burn himself out is related to the tendency for a person to isolate himself. In his efforts to do something great \u2013 if he is not careful \u2013 he may isolate himself from others and therefore not benefit from the good judgment of those who may try to balance him out by putting things into proper perspective. And if he is not careful in his isolated state of mind, in his effort to do something big he could burn himself out. That is possible. \nIt is very important that you don\u2019t isolate yourself, and that you practice good judgment by submitting yourself confidentially to devotees you trust, devotees whom you feel have your spiritual welfare at heart. It is very important that every devotee has somebody they can go to and reveal their mind in confidence, because many burnouts can be avoided if devotees actually have that kind of shelter. I would say that\u2019s the key. The key to protect anyone from burnout is to have somebody who is accessible that you can implicitly trust and pour everything out to, everything. Spill it out. And then decide if it is over-endeavor. Maybe it is just a slight adjustment that is required, and you will feel protected and be able to go on having received the proper assessment of your efforts. But that is different than mundane achievements. Prayasa, we said, is over-endeavoring for mundane achievements that are difficult to achieve. And sometimes, if we are not careful, we may take \u2013 even if we have been given an authorized service to perform \u2013 we can make it mundane by our consciousness. By trying to be the enjoyer of the result, rather than offering the result to Krsna. The same goes for trying to be the enjoyer of the respect, the enjoyer of the prestige, the enjoyer of the profit. Therefore, in every endeavor we also have to be careful to uproot the anarthas. \nAnd therefore Prabhupada was very, very cautious that devotees should not over endeavor to the point where they become neglectful of the essential activities that keep the heart in check: chanting their prescribed rounds every day, not compromising their sadhana, not compromising those activities that will keep their motivations and their perspective clear in the execution of their service. When you find yourself over-endeavoring to the point of becoming neglectful of sadhana, and you justify this by saying that sadhana is not important, then the alarms should be going off. <Maharaja makes the sound like a fire truck> Maybe for few days or something like that. But if it is prolonged, then something is wrong and it needs to be put back into perspective. \nOne more question? \nDevotee: This is an extension of his question, Maharaja. We see, in the case of your Holiness for instance, that your kirtans are amazing and we are really inspired to see how much you are relishing kirtan. We see that there are some devotees who are born with certain skills and talents and it helps them to relish the holy name and to give them taste for chanting. But in certain cases, like in my own case, there are devotees who are not born with any talents or skills. In the context of preaching, in delivering Krsna\u2019s message, there is the example of a small child who is very sick but who is reluctant to take the medicine. The mother is telling the child to take the medicine, but the child is still reluctant. So mother has to play a trick on the child. She takes the pill and puts it in a ladhu. The child likes the ladhu and eats it without knowing that he is also taking the medicine. In a similar way, the holy name is naturally relishable, but sometimes the musical skill someone has helps to make it more attractive. My question is, does this apply \u2013 what you just explained right now \u2013 to brahmacaris? What is the bottom line? What is the special consideration for a brahmacari who wants to acquire a skill or develop a talent? How dangerous is it?\nNRS: In terms of over-endeavor?\nDevotee: Yes, in terms of over-endeavor. \nNRS: Is this a loaded question? <Everyone laughs> Yes? Then you answer it. Go ahead. <Everyone laughs and claps> I can usually sense loaded questions. Will you answer? \nDevotee: I will answer in my next class, Maharaja. \nNRS: Tell us a little something now. Give us a little something.\nDevotee: Actually, first of all, we should thank Niranjana Maharaja for being here. Just being in his presence is so purifying. <Everyone yells \u201cHaribol!\u201d> \nNRS: Actually, it is the other way around. \nDevotee: Thank you, Maharaja, for coming and making us feel so comfortable after all the things that the brahmacaris have had to go through over the last few months. Wisdom through renunciation is what we have here in person. So we should loudly say Haribol and ask him to come again, because we are not yet satisfied, we are not full of Maharaja. <Everyone yells \u201cHaribol!\u201d>\nNRS: Answer. <Everyone laughs>\nDevotee: Actually, what I have understood is that skills are material, but if we have the right intention, we can use them in Krsna\u2019s service. Then those skills are good. But if we try to over-endeavor to learn those skills, it\u2019s simply caused by some kind of competitive spirit. Then I think we should try to avoid doing so. If it is already there that is one thing, but I cannot become a good singer by trying to be a singer. Somebody is born with that skill, and he can become expert in singing. If I am not made for singing\u2026If I see all the pictures in the temple made by Haridas Thakur Prabhu, and I think my paintings should be there on the wall too\u2026And if I try to over-endeavor in the art of painting, still my paintings won\u2019t be good enough for the temple hall, and neither will I get any benefit. So, I think any skill, if I don\u2019t have it, I shouldn\u2019t try to develop it. We all have something to offer to Krsna. Why not perfect that, rather than try to perfect something that is not already there. That is also over-endeavour, according to my understanding. But please correct me, Maharaja.\nNRS: No, it\u2019s fine. Unless of course one has been ordered to develop a skill, like that brahmana who was reading Bhagavad-gita upside down. He was ordered to read Bhagavad-gita every day, but he did not know how to read. If one is ordered to do something, one takes the order on his head and executes it. But simply to be motivated to be expert in these things for some other reason, that is not the criteria. That is not what Krsna sees. Here is one verse I often like to quote by Prahlada Maharaja, \u201cMy dear friends, O sons of demons\u2026\u201d Prahlada Maharaja is speaking to his classmates. \u201cYou cannot please the Supreme Personality of Godhead even if you become expert brahmanas, become advanced in etiquette or vast learning, nor by austerities, nor by chastity, nor by great sacrifices, nor by acceptance of vows. None of these things can award you the pleasure of the Lord. The Lord is pleased only when one has unflinching, unalloyed devotional service to Him. Without sincere devotional service, everything else is simply a show.\u201d So, Prahlada Maharaja is saying that it is not by expert brahmanas. \nbhagavad-bhakti-hinasya \njatih sastram japas tapah\napranasyaiva dehasya \nmandanam loka-ranjanam\n\u201cEven if a person knows thousands of slokas, takes birth in a great family or nation, or is renounced, if he is devoid of devotional service, then all of these things are like ornaments on a dead body.\u201d (Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya 3.11)\nPrahlada Maharaja is making the same point: Even if you become expert in all of these things, without devotion it is a show. A show means that you are doing it to show somebody other than Krsna, because Krsna doesn\u2019t see it. Krsna only sees the devotion. He doesn\u2019t see the fancy notes you play on the harmonium, or the fancy beats you play on the mridanga, or the melodious sound that comes from your mouth. That is not what attracts Krsna. And if you are trying to perfect these things but your endeavor is devoid of devotional service, then it is not going to get Krsna\u2019s attention. It is intended to get somebody else\u2019s attention. That is what a show is: It\u2019s a performance for somebody else. Krsna sees what the intention is. He is bhava grahi janardana \u2013 He understands the motive. \nThat is how to capture Krsna\u2019s attention. If it is not destined to be, it is not destined to be. But that does not in any way mean that we have any less qualification for pleasing the Lord. In fact, it is not the criteria at all. Somebody may be very expert \u2013 he may chant very melodiously and be expert in playing instruments \u2013 but such persons may also be thinking about how to awaken somebody else\u2019s pleasure besides the Lord\u2019s. <Everyone laughs> Skill is simply not the criteria. But if the order is there, then we should take it with our heart. And at the same time know that even if we cannot chant nicely, beautifully, melodiously, expertly\u2026 \nJust like Prabhupada\u2026Prabhupada many times would ask his disciples to give class while he was right there. Imagine Prabhupada. Imagine how much he knows. And here are his disciples just trying to repeat whatever they have heard from Prabhupada. Not so expert. But Prabhupada would relish it. He didn\u2019t get up and leave. He would sit and listen. He relished it even though it may not have been expertly presented. And he would always defend his disciples when pandits would come and say, \u201cOh! You should teach your disciples how to pronounce Sanskrit properly.\u201d Prabhupada would defend his disciples. \nyena tena prakarena\nmanah krsne nivesayet\u2026\nPrabhupada would quote this verse, saying, \u201cAll these things come later. But they are attached to Krsna. That is most important.\u201d He would defend. He would relish. So, we should all think that we are on the stage of not being so expert. We should simply do it to please Krsna. And then Prabhupada will be pleased. Anyway, I am just repeating what you have said. You gave me the sutra. Thank you. Hare Krsna. Srila Prabhupada ki jaya!\n \n","nid":"6160"},{

The file with diacritics can be downloaded at the link below.\n \nApril 16, 2012 - Budapest \u2013 Srimad Bhagavatam 5.12 5-6\nbrahmana uvaca\nayam jano nama calan prthivyam\u2028yah \nparthivah parthiva kasya hetoh\ntasyapi canghryor adhi gulpha-jangha\n-\u2028januru-madhyora-sirodharamsah\namse 'dhi darvi sibika ca yasyam\nsauvira-rajety apadesa aste\nyasmin bhavan rudha-nijabhimano\nrajasmi sindhusv iti durmadandhah\nTranslation:\nThe self-realized brahmana Jada Bharata said: Among the various material combinations and permutations, there are various forms and earthly transformations. For some reason, these move on the surface of the earth and are called palanquin carriers. Those material transformations which do not move are gross material objects like stones. In any case, the material body is made of earth and stone in the form of feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, torso, throat and head. Upon the shoulders is the wooden palanquin, and within the palanquin is the so-called King of Sauvira. The body of the King is simply another transformation of earth, but within that body Your Lordship is situated and falsely thinking that you are the King of the state of Sauvira.\nPurport by Srila Prabhupada:\nAfter analyzing the material bodies of the palanquin carrier and the palanquin passenger, Jada Bharata concludes that the real living force is the living entity. The living entity is the offshoot or offspring of Lord Visnu; therefore within this material world, among moving and nonmoving things, the real principle is Lord Visnu. Due to His presence, everything is working, and there are actions and reactions. One who understands Lord Visnu as the original cause of everything is to be understood to be perfectly situated in knowledge. Although he was falsely proud of being a king, King Rahugana was not really situated in knowledge. Therefore he was rebuking the palanquin carriers, including the self-realized brahmana Jada Bharata. This is the first accusation Jada Bharata made against the King, who was daring to talk to a learned brahmana from the flimsy ground of ignorance, identifying everything with matter. King Rahugana argued that the living entity is within the body and that when the body is fatigued the living entity within must therefore be suffering. It is clearly explained in the following verses that the living entity does not suffer due to the body's fatigue. %Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti gives an example of a child heavily decorated with ornaments; although the child's body is very delicate, he does not feel fatigue, nor do the parents think that his ornaments should be taken away. The living entity has nothing to do with bodily pains and pleasures. These are simply mental concoctions. An intelligent man will find the original cause of everything. Material combinations and permutations may be a matter of fact in worldly dealings, but actually the living force, the soul, has nothing to do with them. Those who are materially upset take care of the body and manufacture daridra-narayana (poor Narayana). However, it is not a fact that the soul or Supersoul becomes poor simply because the body is poor. These are the statements of ignorant people. The soul and Supersoul are always apart from bodily pleasure and pain.\nPurport by Niranjana Swami:\nSo, this is Jada Bharata answering Maharaja Rahugana\u2019s questions. In a previous verse Maharaja Rahugana was asking him: \u201cplease clarify your previous instructions, because they appear to be contradictory to me, and I cannot fully comprehend what you are trying to tell me. Although I can understand it is relevant.\u201d In other words, although Maharaja Rahugana was proud and was thinking himself to be a noble king, he definitely identified with the body and was speaking from that platform to Jada Bharata. Still, he had enough sukrti to be able to accept that the words spoken by Jada Bharata were relevant. After hearing Jada Bharata\u2019s response to the strong, offensive and accusative statements made by Maharaja Rahugana,, he was be able to understand that he had made a terrible mistake. He was thinking, \u201cThis person obviously has something to say.\u201d \nThe first time Jada Bharata spoke, Maharaja Rahugana didn\u2019t fully understand him. In fact, he saw many contradictions in what Jada Bharata said. He saw contradictions because he was analyzing everything from his own frame of reference\u2014his bodily concept of life. When somebody is in the bodily concept of life, they live in duality. They will see many contradictions\u2014good and bad, heat and cold, happiness and distress, honor and dishonor, etc. But even though he saw duality and contradictions in the initial instructions Jada Bharata was giving to him, he had enough sense to inquire deeper. \nThat\u2019s why I said that he had sufficient sukrti. Sukrti means that due to one\u2019s past activities one gets the opportunity to obtain the association of a devotee and to be able to appreciate the value of that devotee\u2019s association. \nBhaktivinoda Thakur explains that there are three different types of sukrti. These are called bhogonmukhi sukrti, moksonmukhi sukrti and bhakty-unmukhi sukrti. Bhogonmukhi sukrti means; having performed some pious activities in the past, these pious activities give opulence, bhoga - enjoyment. Moksonmukhi sukrti means; having performed some activities in past, one gets liberation and jnana. And bhakty-unmukhi sukrti means; activities performed that give the opportunity to get the association of a bhakta, a devotee, and to be able to appreciate the devotee in order to take his association. \nSo Maharaja Rahugana had sufficient sukrti. Although not everything was clear, still he could understand:, \u201cI need to hear more from this person, and to have my doubts cleared\u201d. So this chapter is Jada Bharata\u2019s clarification of his previous instructions. We should not think that he didn\u2019t speak them clearly in previous chapters. He did. But because his audience couldn\u2019t understand, he tried to present it in a way that now the king could understand. So he is presenting it here, in this verse. This is his first answer, which says: this is material nature and this is spiritual nature. That\u2019s it. What is material nature? \nbhumir apo 'nalo vayuh\u2028kham mano buddhir eva ca\u2028ahankara itiyam me\u2028bhinna prakrtir astadha \nKrishna says, \u201cEarth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligent and false ego \u2013 all these comprise my eight separated material energies.\u201d (BG 7.4) And therefore he is saying that everything here \u2013 your body, palanquin, carriers , the ground you are walking on \u2013 it\u2019s all material energy. Your body is simply made of these elements, my body is made of these elements, the other palanquin carriers bodies are made of these elements, and everything is just a transformation of these elements. And now he is getting even more specific. Now, all these are your body, but it also includes your feet, your ankles, your calves, your knees, your thighs, and your torso. Do you understand now? \nIt reminds me of an experience I once had. It is funny it and relevant.. I was speaking to my stepfather, and he was not very submissive. But I was talking about the soul. I used the simple analogy that we often use when we speak to people trying to make them understand that they are different from the body. So, I said to him, \u201cWell, let\u2019s perform a little experiment.\u201d And he was submissive enough to do the experiment. So I said, \u201cPoint to your head\u201d. \u2013 He pointed to his head. \u201cPoint to your elbow\u201d, he pointed to his elbow. \u201cVery good\u201d, I said. \u201cPoint to your knee.\u201d \u2013 he pointed to his knee. \u201cPoint to your foot.\u201d \u2013 He pointed to his foot. \u201cPoint to your chest\u201d \u2013 He pointed to his chest. And then I said, \u201cPoint to your self\u201d, and he did what everybody else does. He pointed here [to the chest]. I said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s your chest. You just pointed to it. Why are you pointing here? You just told me it\u2019s your chest.\u201d I said, \u201cPoint to your self\u201d. So he took his hand and put it on his foot, and he put his other hand on his head and said: \u201cThis is all of it!\u201d. I said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s your head, and that\u2019s your hand and that\u2019s your foot.\u201d At that point he got really angry... \nHe was not as submissive as Maharaja Rahugana. He just could not accept. He wouldn\u2019t let me finish\u2014that he is something else besides the chest. He didn\u2019t want to hear it. No sukrti. But here, Jada Bharata recognized Maharaja Rahugana\u2019s sukrti. So, he is referring to all your ankles, knees, calves, your thighs, your torso, your head and feet, your shoulders, palanquin and he says, \u201cBut you are different. The Lord is situated within that body and you are falsely thinking that you are the King of the State of Sauvira. So Prabhupada is making a point in his commentary that ultimately everything is emanation from the Supreme Lord. Just as Krishna says: \napareyam itas tv anyam\nprakrtim viddhi me param\njiva-bhutam maha-baho\u2028\nyayedam dharyate jagat\n\u201cBesides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.\u201d (BG 7.5)\nThroughout Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna distinguishes between that which is material and that which is spiritual. But He makes it clear,\netad-yonini bhutani\u2028\nsarvanity upadharaya\u2028\naham krtsnasya jagatah\nprabhavah pralayas tatha\n\u201cOf all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world you should know for certain that I am both its origin and dissolution.\u201d (BG 7.6) \nSo, ultimately everything in this world exists because it is emanating from the energy of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Therefore, Prabhupada explains that an intelligent person should understand the source of everything within this world and who the original cause of everything is. One, who understands Lord Vishnu as the original cause of everything is to be understood to be perfectly situated in knowledge. As we oftentimes say, not a blade of grass can move without the will of the Lord. Krishna is the supreme cause in this cosmic manifestation and He is the source of all living entities, aham bija-pradah pita. And although He created this material energy, He is not responsible for the sufferings of the living entities because the living entities, being minute part and parcels of Supreme Lord, also have minute independence. If they break the laws of material nature, as arranged by Supreme Lord, consequences will be there. So, it is not that the Lord is directly responsible for the suffering of the living entities. \nVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakur gives the example that the sun causes the lilies to open and close. And the bees are dependent upon the lilies being open for their enjoyment. So, although the lilies open and close by the appearance and disappearance of the sun, the sun is not responsible for the pleasure and the suffering of the bees. In the same way, this material nature acts in a certain way, but the living entities themselves due to their identification with material nature\u2014 which is the root cause of their suffering\u2014are investing so much in this body. To the degree that the living entity invests in the body, to that degree they identify with the pains and pleasures of the body. \nPrabhupada gives the example of the soul and supersoul, comparing them to the driver and passenger of a car. The driver of the car, who is the possessor of the car, while driving his car picks up a passenger. The passenger gets in the car and driver continues to drive. But then all of a sudden his car gets hit. The driver feels a lot of suffering because he identifies with that car. A lot of energy was invested, in most cases, in possessing that car; a lot of work, and a lot of time maintaining it. Maybe there are still debts that need to be paid on it. It\u2019s possible he had no insurance. So, when he gets hit, because of all that energy that was put into the car, he feels pain. But the passenger doesn\u2019t feel the same pain. He gets out of the car and walks away. \u201cSorry. I will look for another car to get to my destination.\u201d The passenger does not identify with the car because passenger didn\u2019t invest so much in the car. So in the same way the driver of the car is the soul and passenger is the Supersoul. The soul, who invests so much energy into the body, is suffering due to identification with the body. \nRupa Goswami talks about the liberated soul,\niha yasya harer dasye\u2028\nkarmana manasa gira\u2028\nnikhilasv apy avasthasu\njivan-muktah sa ucyate\nAnyone, who has completely engaged his mind, his words, and his body in the service of the Supreme Lord, he is liberated soul, even while within the body. (Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu 1.2.187)\nSo, therefore we can understand that devotional service to the Lord is liberated activity. For one, whose consciousness, mind, senses, ears, and everything that comprises this physical body, is fully engaged in the service of Krishna, then he is already liberated. It is not that liberation means after giving up the body. He is already liberated because he is fully engaged in the liberated activity of full devotional service, and therefore does not identify with the body. \nIn another commentary in the Bhagavatam, in the third canto, Prabhupada gives another example about the liberated soul. He says that although it may appear that a liberated soul is suffering due to results of karma, he is not. He gives the analogy of the fan. When the electricity is going into the fan, the fan is spinning. But when you pull out the plug of the fan it is not that the blade immediately stops. The blade continues to move, not because of the current, but because of the previous movement. But there is no current going in or in other words, no more karmic reactions are accummulating. Why? Because he is fully engaged in devotional service and is therefore liberated. There are no more reactions, which are the cause of future suffering. \nStill, we may see that the body grows old and body gets diseased. Prabhupada says that\u2019s the result of previous motion. But it is not because it is any new karmic reactions. So, of course, we are speaking about liberated souls. Those who are cent percent engaged in devotional service to the Lord are completely on the spiritual platform. Being situated on the spiritual platform they do not identify with a dualities of this material world. \nKrishna says, for one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is reached and he attains tranquility. For such a man heat and cold, happiness and distress, honor and dishonor - they are all the same. One, who has actually conquered his mind, he transcends duality, and therefore he does not experience pain and pleasures in the same way as a person who identifies with the body. In fact there is a verse we often quote, by Lord Kapila, \nmad-asrayah katha mrstah\nsrnvanti kathayanti ca\ntapanti vividhas tapa\u2028\nnaitan mad-gata-cetasah \n\u201cEngaged constantly in chanting and hearing about Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sadhus do not suffer from material miseries because they are always filled with thoughts of My pastimes and activities.\u201d (SB 3.25.23)\nNow, of course we hear this, and we hear about how there is no suffering for the living entity, there is no such thing as fatigue, physical distress. And we may examine our own pains and pleasures, sufferings and enjoyment. And we may see by analytical study that we still identify with pain. Not only do we identify with pain, but usually we respond to it by trying to relieve it. \nPrabhupada explains in the Seventh Canto of a Bhagavatam that those who are not on the liberated platform, should not imitate liberated souls. Therefore, they deal with these things, but with a proper understanding. What is the proper understanding? Prabhupada also explains this point in the prayer, I think, in the commentary of the prayer of Prahlada Maharaja. \nbalasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha\nnartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh \nHe is praying to Lord Nrisimhadeva, \u201cO my Lord, O Supreme, because of the bodily concept of life, embodied souls, neglected and not cared for by You, cannot do anything for their betterment. Whatever remedies they may accept although perhaps temporary beneficial, they are certainly impermanent...\u201d (SB 7.9.19) And he gives three examples. For example, a boat in water cannot rescue a drowning man; parents cannot save their suffering child; and the expert physician and medicine cannot relieve a suffering patient. \nThis is Prahlada Maharaja speaking in this way. He is saying that those in the bodily concept of life, are neglected and not cared for by the Lord... Why are they neglected? Because they are so much entrapped in the bodily concept of life that their faith is only in medicine, in doctors, and in material arrangements. They have no faith in the Supreme Lord. Therefore they are neglected. The Lord does not intervene in their arrangements because the living entities are simply getting results of their past karma, which, as we already described, is an arrangement by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Who has set up this material world to punish and reward the living entities according to their activities in this world. The Lord is witness. He is in the heart, but he is not suffering, just like the passenger, who got into the car and got out of the car, is not suffering. But the living entity, who invests everything into material nature, may find temporary relief, but still, it is temporary. It is not permanent. He is still going to suffer. \nJust like the person, who is lying on his bed, extremely ill, and his family comes in and says, \u201cWe got the best doctor in the world and he can cure this. He is bringing medicines from the other side of the world.\u201d Temporarily he may feel some relief. He is thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve got the best doctor coming. Best medicine.\u201d Does that mean he will not die? Ultimately it is the Lord Who makes the decisions. Those who depend upon the Lord for everything, who are always conscious of the Lord and depend on his determination, his decision, even if they die, for them it does not make any difference. \nPrabhupada would often quote that verse about the brahmacari, butcher, saintly person and a prince. \u201cO prince, may you live a long life, O brahmacari may you die now. O saintly person, whether you live or die doesn\u2019t make any difference. But you, oh butcher, don\u2019t live and don\u2019t die.\u201d \nSo, prince, yes, you can live. Live a long life, because you are enjoying your royal opulence now. But because you are simply enjoying your opulence, according to previous karma, when you die, unfortunately there will be karma from this life. You will have to accept those reactions. Therefore, may you live a a long life. Brahmacari, (don\u2019t take this literally) you may get entangled in the future, so better die. Why are you laughing? Do you have some realizations? But you saintly person, who can also be either a brahmacari or householder. You, saintly person, whether you live or die, it does not make any difference.. If you live, you are serving the Lord, if you die, you are serving the Lord. The Lord will never forget you. But you butcher, don\u2019t live, because by living you cause so much suffering to others. And don\u2019t die either, because when you die you are going to be killed as many times as the number of animals you butchered. \nSo the important understanding is that of the saintly person, of course. The saintly person is one who understands that, yes I may have some temporary relief, I may take medicines, I may go to a physician, but most important is the service to the Lord. Therefore I will undertake these measures for the service of the Lord. Without the service of the Lord what is the value of a prolonged life? What is the value of taking care of this body without service to the Lord? Therefore, on this platform the devotee understands that although there may be sufferings, may be pains, and difficulties, diseases, but his primary interest is the service of the Lord.\nnarayana-parah sarve\u2028\nna kutascana bibhyati\nsvargapavarga-narakesv\u2028\napi tulyartha-darsinah (SB 6.17.28)\nA devotee\u2019s only interest is the service of the Lord. Whether they are in heaven, in hell, liberated, for them it is all the same. So for the service of the Lord the devotee takes up his initiative to take care of his body to serve the Lord. On that basis we understand how to deal with not being liberated and still identifying with the body. But we should always understand that a solution to all suffering is not a temporary relief from the pain. The solution to all suffering is not the healthy body, because even those with healthy bodies suffer. And that is the point that Srila Prabhupada is making here in the end of the purport. \nPrabhupada is talking about daridra narayana. He is talking about the followers of Vivekananda. Vivekananda had this slogan. To attain Narayan one must serve daridra narayana. In other words, they were impersonalists. Brahma satyam jagan mithya, which means that Brahman is true and material world, is false. They reject this material world as false. Whereas devotee knows that material world is not false. It is the energy of the Lord, but it is temporary. \nSo because the impersonalists reject this material world as a false, they try to achieve their state of renunciation by completely detaching themselves from this world. They perform meditation, they study scripture, and they try to realize Brahman. But because there is no attachment to the Lord, then what happens to them? They come back and say that service to Narayana, service to the Lord is service to humanity. Therefore, they say, if you want to serve Narayana, serve the sufferings of humanity; but not just humanity -daridra narayana - those who are the poor narayanas. Those who are the poor narayanas - you take care of them. The poor narayanas are the people with canes, sticks and elderly people, walking on the streets. They are poor. So they take up philanthropic activity and they say, this is service to Narayana. They open up hospitals and so many other things. Although previously they renounced this world, but now they say, \u201cNo, we renounced this world to achieve the state of Narayana consciousness. I am Narayana, you are Narayana. But we should give our service to daridra narayana, poor Narayan. \nPrabhupada one time was having a conversation with devotees in Mayapur. Prabhupada couldn\u2019t tolerate this philosophical misconception and would often speak about this daridra narayana philosophy. He said, yes, they say we should simply serve daridra narayana, but what about Lakshmi Narayana? What about Lakshmi devi? What about Sita devi? What about Radharani? Serve Them\u2014not only poor Narayan. They don\u2019t want to serve Radha and Krishna, Lakshmi - Narayana. And he explains, why. You go to India and there is still so many poor Narayanas on the streets. But they collect thousands and thousands of dollars for daridra narayana. And all the sannyasis, all the renunciates, they simply live lavishly, they are living so comfortably but still most of these so called daridra narayanas are still suffering in poverty. \nSo Prabhupada is explaining that, because they do not have sufficient understanding of what is real renunciation, they are trying to renounce this world and then they take up philanthropic activities as their renunciation. Therefore, they cannot understand what real renunciation is, the service to the Supreme Lord Narayana. Still they manufacture this darida narayana, because they are in bodily concept of life. They even perform sacrifices and kill goats. So Prabhupada says, yes, poor Narayanas are the people, who are in poverty, but still they kill animals simply to satisfy their palate. So they have no understanding of the spiritual platform of the soul. Therefore, they try to relieve the sufferings of humanity simply by catering to the physical well-being of the body. \nTherefore Prabhupada says here, \u201cThose who are materially upset, take care of the body and manufacture daridra narayana, poor Narayan.\u201d However, this is not a fact that a soul and a Supersoul become poor simply because the body is poor. These are statements of ignorant people. The soul and Supersoul are always apart from the bodily pleasure and pain. This is Jada Bharata\u2019s clarification, and the beginning of his clarification were his instructions in the previous chapter. He started right from the very basic instructions, just like Krishna did to Arjuna. He told Arjuna, \u201cYou are lamenting for what is not worthy of grief. The wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.\u201d Starting right from the very basics of spiritual life, \u2013 You are not that body. Jada Bharata said, \u201cMaharaja Rahugana, you are not that shoulder, the arm, the leg, the chest; the feet. You are different and are within that body.\u201d\nNow he will continue his instructions, and will explain to Maharaja Rahugana who he actually is. Maharaja Rahugana became enlightened by the mercy of Jada Bharata and he came to realize his constitutional nature as the servant of Krishna. Such was the benefit he received from his bhakty-unmukhi sukrti. He had sufficient sukrti to recognize that, \u201cI need to associate and to hear from this person.\u201d Therefore, because he enquired deeper into this subject matter in a submissive spirit and placed his faith in the words of Jada Bharata, he was able to achieve the real fruit of sadhu sanga. \nAll right, I think I should stop here. Hare Krishna, all Glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n","nid":"6092"},{
"title":"Transcription of an Initiation Lecture Given in Taichung, Taiwan on March 24th, 2012","ref":{"target_id":"5091"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Fri, 2012-09-14 22:54","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially-edited transcription of an initiation lecture given in Taichung, Taiwan on March 24th, 2012:\n\nNiranjana Swami:\nSo, I\u2019ve asked Madana Mohan to speak a few words about the significance of this event. He has helped shed some light about the importance of this event in the life of a devotee who is taking initiation. I would like to continue on this and speak a little bit about it in relationship to the Holy Name, because, as Madan Mohan referred to, this is harinama initiation \u2014initiation into the Holy Name. Although the Holy Name is self-sufficient, still it is important to make that personal commitment, as Madana Mohan spoke about, because by making that commitment, it helps us to remain fixed in our purpose in chanting.\nWe may make a commitment to the Holy Name, but sometimes we see in our lives that we make many commitments and do not keep them. Then, if there is no person present, or if we think that there is no person present, observing our lack of commitment we think, \"Oh, it's not so important.\" Therefore, privately anybody can make a commitment to the Holy Name and say, \"I commit myself to You.\" Then it is between that person and the Holy Name.\nBut when we make that commitment in the presence of other Vaishnavas, in the presence of the Deities, of the spiritual master, and in the presence of the sacred fire, it helps us to realize the greater significance of that commitment. It keeps us accountable to more than just ourselves and the Holy Name. For that reason it is beneficial for us to accept initiation, because it is evidence that we have committed ourselves to the Holy Name.\nSo, what does it mean to be committed to the Holy Name? That is what I wish to speak about a little bit today. Not only for Bhaktin Chiong-ying but for everyone else who is present, who someday also may aspire to make some commitment.\nThe Holy Name of Krishna is non-different from the Supreme. Each and every one of us has an eternal relationship with the Supreme. The constitutional nature of every living being is that of a servant. When we forget that relationship as a servant of the Supreme, we still have to serve. If everyone examines their own lives from one day to the next, they will see that they are serving in so many ways. We are serving our friends, our family members, and we are serving society. In society, government leaders have to serve the people, and people serve the government leaders by giving their votes. Community leaders serve the citizens. Businessman serves his clients and consumers - he wants them to purchase his product. Therefore, when they purchase his product, he assures them that, \"I will repair it for you, if it breaks down.\" The client or consumer serves the businessman by giving some monetary exchange for his product or service.\nA Husband serves his wife; children serve their parents; parents serve their children. We also are servants of our own bodies. We are servants of the mind; we are servants of the senses. When the senses dictate and say, \"Look at this\", we immediately look. When the body says, \"You're hungry, you're hungry\u201c, we serve the body and we eat. When the body has other demands, we have to serve them, and if we don\u2019t, we suffer the consequences.\nTherefore, if we analyze our existence in this world we will see that our constitutional nature is to serve and that constitutional nature cannot be changed. We can say, \"I don\u2019t want to serve. From this day onwards I will never serve any master again\", but there will be consequences. Therefore there is an expression in English that \"No man is an island unto himself.\" No man is an island unto himself. We are all dependent upon everyone else. Our nature is that we are dependent, and if we want to fulfill certain necessities of life, we have to perform certain services in order to obtain them.\nThis is not bad \u2013 it is our nature. But because we are embodied, we have so many services, which are connected to the body. However, when we speak about service to the Holy Name, service to the Vaisnavas, service to the Supreme, we are talking about service which is connected not to the body but to ourselves, and which serves the needs of the self. Just as every body has certain needs, every self also has certain needs.\nJust like sometimes we speak about necessities of life. When we think of necessities of life, generally we think of food, shelter, and clothing. But when we speak about spiritual life, we are defining a different set of necessities. The basis of spiritual life is understanding that \"I am a spirit soul by nature.\" The nature of the soul is eternal. Its existence is not dependent upon this temporary physical body. Although we're connected to the body, our tendency is to think that when we speak of necessities of life, we are thinking about maintaining life within the body. Food and air are necessities for maintaining life in the body, but they are not necessities for life because life has its own necessity beyond the temporary body. Therefore, when we speak of necessity of life, we are speaking about necessity of the soul, or the life within the body and the life that continues to live even when the body exists no more.\nLife has its own necessity. What is that necessity of life? As we said, we are all servants. The necessity of life is to understand, \"what is the object of our service? What is our connection after this body exists no more? To whom we are connected? How are we connected?\" Well, if we examine, how we are always serving in this body, then it should be logical to conclude that we are also serving, when we are not in this body.\nSome people think that the end of this body is the end of our life, and they live their life that way. They think, \"This life is only one time. While I'm here I should get as much as I can to enjoy my life.\" So, they dedicate their whole life trying to get as much as they can for the body. Therefore, when they think of the necessity of life, they are always thinking about their connection with their body. \"After this body goes, I don't exist anymore. Why should I care? Why should I accept any inconvenience? Why should I accept any austerity? Why should I make any other commitment in life except the commitment which satisfies the needs of my body?\" But there is a problem with that philosophy. The problem is \u2013 it does not satisfy the self. This is a big problem. As much as we dedicate our lives to the body, we still are not happy. It is like having a golden birdcage. It is golden and it's beautiful. Every day you wake up and polish the cage. But there is a problem - there is the bird in the cage. If you simply polish the cage and don't feed the bird, the bird will die.\nIn the same way, if we simply dedicate our life to always making this body happy and we are neglecting the needs of our self, the soul, the problem is that although we work so hard to be happy, we still feel some lack in our life. The self has a necessity too, and unless the self makes a connection with that necessity, we will live our life in futility. We will simply grow old, give up this body, and we will have to come back again and try it again in a different body.\nTherefore, spiritual life means that I have to make a connection with my spiritual master. Our spiritual master is not only a person who gives us instructions in how to advance in spiritual life. The spiritual master is one who gives the most valuable connection in life - the spiritual master at the time of initiation gives the disciple the Holy Name of the Lord.\nThere is nothing more valuable than the Holy Name of the Lord, because the Holy Name of Krishna and Krishna are non-different. When the disciple makes a commitment that, \"I will serve the Holy Name although I have so many masters to serve\u2026Initiation means, \"Holy Name first\". That is the meaning of initiation \u2013 Holy Name is first.\nFrom this day on I am making a commitment that the Holy Name is first. Everything else I must do also, but if I don\u2019t make my commitment to the Holy Name first, then what is the value of all these other commitments? They will all end at the time of death. I may dedicate so much of my energy serving these temporary masters, but when we give up this body, these masters are gone, and then we have new masters. In our next body we will have new masters. \nSometimes, when the river is flowing, little clumps of straw will gather in little whirlpools along the banks of the river. They stay together for some time, but the continuous flow in the river breaks up those clumps. They continue downstream as the current catches them again. Do you think all those little pieces of straw are the same straws that were upstream? No, they come and gather in a new collection of straw, and the little whirlpool keeps them together for some time. Then they break up again and go further downstream. These are the masters with whom we temporarily come together within our life. So even if we satisfy these masters, how has there been any gain for the eternal soul?\nTherefore, our real master is the Holy Name and at the time of initiation we accept that from this day on chanting Krsna's name is first. The disciple accepts a vow to chant Krishna's names every day. It doesn't necessarily mean that the first thing I do in the morning is to chant all my rounds, although that is good and that is preferred. The serious sadhakas will always think like that. They will always think that, \"If I have many things to do today, I'll wake up early enough so that I can chant all my rounds before doing anything else.\" That is why the brahma muhurta is the most auspicious time for chanting the Holy Name. Everybody else is sleeping. But the sadhaka is always awake. \nKrishna says in the \"Bhagavad-gita\", \"What is night for the ordinary man is daytime for self-realized soul.\" That means, while everyone else is sleeping, the devotee, the sadhaka, is always awake in his efforts to remember the Lord. And what is everyone else's daytime? What they do during the daytime? - They are always working hard to make money, to fulfill all the desires of \"my masters\". But the saintly person considers that as nighttime. He only does what is necessary to maintain body and soul.\nSo this is the shift that a person makes in his life. Actually that shift is supposed to take place before initiation. Therefore everyone, who aspires for initiation, should make that shift before initiation. But as we said, initiation means, \"Now I am making a vow. This shift in my life is permanent. From this point on I will never go back again.\" This is initiation. This is the significance of initiation on this day. Madana Mohan explained in his presentation at the beginning that at the time of initiation Krishna accepts that devotee to be as good as Himself. He sees that this person now is saying to Krishna, \"Krishna, I am always connected to You in the form of Your Holy name, and I will never break that connection.\" This is the significance of our event, this initiation ceremony today. \n","nid":"5995"},{
"title":"Transcription of a short talk at the end of a meeting with disciples on the last day of the Lithuania Festival (July 22, 2012)","ref":"","attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Mon, 2012-07-23 00:56","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"1","body":"The following is a partially edited transcription of a closing talk at a meeting with disciples who gathered together at the end of the Lithuania Festival on July 22, 2012:\nAlthough it's not going to be my standard format for all future meetings, it's important for me to be able to sit and hear how all of you appreciate other devotees. I have an ever-increasing concern about the future of our society.\nI speak about a certain point often\u2014 that it's always wonderful to see new people coming to Krsna consciousness, but it's distressful to see old devotees leaving. I've also said many times that we can't say our movement is expanding because new people are coming when older devotees are also leaving.\nIt's not easy for me to turn a blind eye to the older devotees who feel unsatisfied in the association of devotees. It's a concern that just doesn't go away from me. I can't just forget about it and think that it doesn't exist. It kind of burns in my heart. I therefore find some solace by trying to emphasize to the devotees about the need to genuinely appreciate the association of each other.\nI can come once or twice a year to maybe spend a few days and everything is nice while I'm here. But after I leave what happens in the devotees' lives? I feel the need to leave something behind. Therefore I always try to include instructions which help devotees deal with their own shortcomings and anarthas and which will enable them to appreciate the value of the devotee association they have when I'm not here. It's not that association is available only when a spiritual master comes for a visit. If I can leave behind something that will help devotees appreciate each other, I feel that's an important contribution because that will give strength to our movement and will give our movement a future.\nI'm not going to be around forever and neither are my godbrothers and godsisters going to be around forever. What hope will we have to see Srila Prabhupada's mission go on for 10,000 years if we can't leave this appreciation for each other behind? There are certainly signs of expansion in our movement. So many new people are coming. It's wonderful to see. But I also think about how these new people will become old devotees and will be able to stay in the association of devotees. It's not going to be only by an occasional visit by their spiritual master. If they have any hope to survive, they have to be able to also appreciate the association of devotees they are with on a more regular basis. New people will also judge both Krsna consciousness and this movement by how all of you associate with each other. They will especially look to see how the older devotees are associating with each other?\nI think of the story Sridama Prabhu tells. One man was regularly visiting a temple in America. Every Sunday he would be there at the program always dressed in Western clothes and always in the background. But he used to come week after week, year after year. He didn't really look like he wanted to get more involved so nobody really pushed him to do so.\nFinally one day one devotee sat down and tried to get closer with him. He asked him, \"You've been coming to our temple for a long time, haven't you? The man answered, \"Yes. Fifteen years.\" The devotee was amazed. \"You've been coming fifteen years? Why aren't getting more involved?\" The man replied, \"Can I be frank with you?\" \"Yes, said the devotee. \"Please tell me.\" And the guest said, \"When I see how you associate with each other I think it's better to remain a guest.\" That's really profound.\nI'm not saying that this is a general trend of our society. It is an important warning though to take into serious consideration.\nSo the point is that people are also going to judge the movement by the leader's followers and not just by the leaders themselves.\nThere is a verse in the Bhagavatam that says that a wrong act committed by the servant leads people in general to blame the master, just as a spot of white leprosy on any part of the body spoils all of the skin. These words were spoken by Krsna Himself about His servants Jaya and Vijaya when they offended the four Kumaras. Krsna became so concerned that He personally went to that place and He said to the four Kumaras \"If My servants have done something offensive to you then I'm prepared to cut off My arm if it's the only way I can rectify what they have done.\"\nSo Krsna said that the improper behavior of those who claim to be servants leads people in general to blame the master. This means that the master naturally feels responsible for the behavior of his servant. He's therefore not happy if his servants behave well only in his presence. There must also be good behavior in his absence. He needs to know how you associate with each other, appreciate each other, overlook the faults of each other and see the good qualities in each other. He's concerned that you can come together to glorify the Lord despite all obstacles, in spite of all the extra baggage (anarthas) we carry with us into this movement.\nTo stay in the association of devotees is tested by time. Time will test all of us. Sometimes Krsna, in order to keep His garden flourishing, also has to weed his garden. In other words, sometimes if we see devotees leaving, it could also be that Krsna is weeding His garden. We should therefore all try to become valuable flowers in Krsna's garden. Don't behave in a way that will cause people to have a wrong impression of our movement and a wrong impression of it's leaders. Take up Srila Prabhupada's mission and learn how to give yourself by helping others in their Krsna consciousness. This is something that Srila Prabhupada wanted all of his followers to do\u2014 to preach and be good examples.\nTherefore it's with these concerns in mind that I have been organizing meetings like this because it's very important for me to see and hear how you are connected in the association of devotees. It eases my anxiety. because if I sense that devotees aren't connected, they may not be sitting in this room next year.\nI don't always note my audience by who I see. I also take note of who I don't see. Those who I don't see, I usually try to find out why I don't see them. There may be some valid reason. Still, the point is that I want to see all of you continue to come to these festivals year after year, to see that you are strong and to see that you are nicely connected in the association of devotees. I feel that's the best service I can offer all of you right now and I ask you to please allow me to continue to serve you in this way. OK? Thank you.\n","nid":"5709"},{
"title":"Transcription of closing talk with disciples in Donetsk on July 9, 2012","ref":{"target_id":"5646"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Thu, 2012-07-12 09:34","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"1","body":"The following is a partially edited transcription of the closing words Niranjana Swami gave in a meeting with his disciples in Donetsk, July 9, 2012.\n\nPrabhupada writes in Caitanya Caritamrita that the test of the spiritual master is his ability to make others Vaisnavas. \n\"A spiritual master is recognized as an actual guru when it is seen that he has changed the character of his disciples.\" (Caitanya Caritamrita, Antya Lila, Chapter 3, Text 143)\nIn many places he also explains that it's not the number of followers that make one a spiritual master.\n\"And because we are a little bit strict in this matter, we have not a very large number of followers, neither do we want any large number of nonsense followers. We want only one moon at night, and we do not care for millions of stars.\" (Letter dated January 18, 1968)\nMany politicians, celebrities, movie stars, businessmen, etc. have many followers. That doesn't make them a spiritual master. \nSo therefore I oftentimes think of this quote by Prabhupada\u2014 that the spiritual master is recognized by the character of his disciples. \nFor me to consider myself a worthy servant of Srila Prabhupada, I must be anxious to see how devotees I'm training are developing Vaisnava qualities. If they are not, then my service to Srila Prabhupada is incomplete. I can't say that it's a failure because there is no failure in spiritual life. But I can say incomplete. \nOne of the most important qualities I try to observe developing in devotees is their ability to be nonenvious. Envy is the root cause of our being in the material world. One of the characteristics of nonenviousness is the ability to see the good qualities in others. \nVaisnavas are recognized by the qualities they manifest. Therefore wherever we see these Vaisnava qualities that the scriptures speak about, we should appreciate them. \nIt's the desire to see Vaisnava qualities manifesting in devotees which prompts me to have discussions like this. It's important for me to observe how devotees are becoming nonenvious. \nOne symptom of an envious person is that he cannot appreciate others. They think their service is the most important. And they think that anybody else's service that competes with their service is less important and has to be suppressed. This is not the spirit of the spiritual world.\nIn the spiritual world the spirit is the exact opposite. In the spiritual world, everyone is eager to bring others forward and not themselves. Everyone is eager to recognize and appreciate the service of others and to push others' service forward to associate with Krsna. \nThe most intimate associates of Krsna are those servants who are always eager to bring Krsna together with other devotees while they stay in the background. Those are the most intimate and dearest servants. And Krsna feels so indebted to that nonenvious service that He gives Himself to them. \nThat is the way to advance in spiritual life. To develop this quality of nonenviousness means to become very pleased in seeing others coming closer in their relationship with Krsna. We should aspire to stay in the background. That is how to get Krsna's attention. That is nonenviousness. That is the quality of a Vaisnava.\nSo that is what motivates me to have meetings and dialogues of this nature. I become very pleased when I observe how devotees can glorify other devotees and genuinely appreciate them for their service and their devotion. \nMaybe you might have thought that I was asking you to speak about other disciples of mine, but that is not what I was asking. I will be very happy if you also glorify devotees who are not my disciples. It's not that only my disciples are important to me. I don't think that way. To whatever degree you can express your gratitude and appreciation for any devotee is satisfying to me. \nSo this meeting is an exercise of humility and nonenviousness. You'll find that if you practice these things it will become very natural because Krsna is pleased and because it is so satisfying.\nSo the more we feel Krsna's pleasure in our life the more we will be inclined to repeat those activities which bring His pleasure. That's how one comes to the spontaneous platform. You will spontaneously glorify devotees and recognize their good qualities and will be very eager to speak about them instead of yourself. That ability to glorify others says so much about yourself that you really don't have to say anything else. Thank you. Hare Krsna.\n \n","nid":"5648"},{

One of the syllables was taken from the sixteenth and the other from the twenty-first of the sparsa alphabets, and both joined to become the wealth of the renounced order of life.\nPURPORT\nIn Sanskrit language, the consonant alphabets are divided into two divisions, namely the sparsa-varnas and the talavya-varnas. From ka to ma the letters are known as the sparsa-varnas, and the sixteenth of the group is called ta, whereas the twenty-first letter is called pa. So when they are joined together, the word tapa, or penance, is constructed. This penance is the beauty and wealth of the brahmanas and the renounced order of life. According to Bhagavata philosophy, every human being is meant simply for this tapa and for no other business, because by penance only can one realize his self; and self-realization, not sense gratification, is the business of human life. This tapa, or penance, was begun from the very beginning of the creation, and it was first adopted by the supreme spiritual master, Lord Brahma. By tapasya only can one get the profit of human life, and not by a polished civilization of animal life. The animal does not know anything except sense gratification in the jurisdiction of eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. But the human being is made to undergo tapasya for going back to Godhead, back home.\nWhen Lord Brahma was perplexed about how to construct the material manifestations in the universe and went down within the water to find out the means and the source of his lotus seat, he heard the word tapa vibrated twice. Taking the path of tapa is the second birth of the desiring disciple. The word upasrnot is very significant. It is similar to upanayana, or bringing the disciple nearer to the spiritual master for the path of tapa. So Brahmaji was thus initiated by Lord Krsna, and this fact is corroborated by Brahmaji himself in his book the Brahma-samhita. In the Brahma-samhita Lord Brahma has sung in every verse govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami. Thus Brahma was initiated by the Krsna mantra, by Lord Krsna Himself, and thus he became a Vaisnava, or a devotee of the Lord, before he was able to construct the huge universe. It is stated in the Brahma-samhita that Lord Brahma was initiated into the eighteen-letter Krsna mantra, which is generally accepted by all the devotees of Lord Krsna. We follow the same principle because we belong to the Brahma sampradaya, directly in the disciplic chain from Brahma to Narada, from Narada to Vyasa, from Vyasa to Madhva Muni, from Madhva Muni to Madhavendra Puri, from Madhavendra Puri to Isvara Puri, from Isvara Puri to Lord Caitanya and gradually to His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, our divine master.\nOne who is thus initiated in the disciplic succession is able to achieve the same result or power of creation. Chanting of this holy mantra is the only shelter of the desireless pure devotee of the Lord.

This empowerment is indicated here in this verse because Lord Brahma was the recipient of the mantra which was given directly by Lord Krsna Himself, and by doing so, by receiving and accepting that mantra as divine, Lord Brahma became qualified to execute his duties to the Lord. \nEmpowerment, as we know, is something that comes through disciplic succession, and Prabhupada specifically refers to that here in his commentary when he says that this mantra was received from Krsna directly to Brahma, from Brahma to Narada, from Narada to Vyasa, from Vyasa to Madhava Mumi, from Madhava Muni to Madhavendra Puri, and to Isvara Puri and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta, and of course Srila Prabhupada. And as we know, disciplic succession includes other personalities as well, all in that line who were empowered to fulfill the Lord\u2019s purposes in this world - just as Lord Brahma was responsible to fulfill the Lord\u2019s purpose in the matter of creation - and who cannot do so without being sufficiently empowered by the Lord. \nAs we know, as described in this chapter, Lord Brahma appeared from the lotus flower. He is the first created being within the universe, manifested from the lotus flower from the naval of the Garbodakasayi Visnu, and when he thus appeared there was nothing surrounding him, all he could see was darkness. And therefore he was trying to understand not only the purpose for which he was there but also the source from where did he come from, so he decided to begin his search by climbing down the stem of lotus flower, as Prabhupada talks about it here in his commentary, and then he found that the lotus flower is coming from the very large ocean. And when he stuck his head into the ocean he heard these transcendental syllables ta-pa, which were vibrated by the Lord. \nIn the verse SB 2.9.4 it is described that Lord Brahma was engaged in non-deceptive penance.\n\u201cO King, the Personality of Godhead, being very much pleased with Lord Brahma because of his nondeceptive penance in bhakti-yoga, presented His eternal and transcendental form before Brahma. And that is the objective goal for purifying the conditioned soul.\u201d (SB 2.9.4)\nLord Brahma\u2019s non-deceptive penance was that he genuinely wanted to know his purpose for being here. There was no other motivation for being involved in his penances and austerities. And because he accepted that vibration of ta-pa was coming from a divine source, although he was unaware of that source at that time, therefore after hearing that vibration he went back up the lotus stem, sat in the lotus flower and accepted those syllables to be directly given to him to prepare him for what he was supposed to do. \nAnd as we know, because he accepted it as divine and he was non-deceptive in his penances and austerities, the Lord being very pleased by his voluntary acceptance of austerities\u2026 Of course we may say, \u201cWell, what choice did he have? What else was there for him to do? There wasn\u2019t a material world for him to become side-tracked. There was nothing else available to entice him to do anything else. To meditate was the only engagement available for him.\u201d [Guru Maharaja laughs]\nBut still, because he was the first created being he had the potency to do so, and that potency was impregnated into him by the will of the Supreme Lord. Therefore because of his non-deceptive penances he accepted that, rather than\u2026 We may try to imagine someone else in similar situation where there is only darkness, there is nothing else around and there is nothing to do, then one may say, \u201cWhy not go to sleep? That\u2019s a good option\u201d. [Guru Maharaja and devotees laugh] And as we know, Lord Brahma has capacity to sleep because after his day he has a night and he goes to sleep. So one may say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go sleep now? Why should I engage in austerities and penances?\u201d\nBut he was motivated to do so, because\u2026 And that\u2019s why I believe the word \u201cnon-deceptive penance\u201d was included in that verse, to help us understand that Brahma\u2019s purpose and intent was not to achieve anything else than to actually understand his purpose for being there, as well as to understand the source, or the origin of his existence on the lotus flower. Therefore he was totally non-deceptive in that respect, he took it as divine, and he engaged in austerities and meditation. And the Lord was so pleased that by dint of his meditation and austerities for a thousand celestial years, the Lord appeared to him and revealed to him Vaikuntha, the spiritual world. He showed him, \u201cHere, this is the spiritual world.\u201d Then Lord Brahma understood that, although the spiritual world is three quarters of the creation of the Lord, nonetheless one quarter of that creation is the material world, and therefore he had been given the responsibility and inspired by the Lord to carry out his duty in the matter of creation. \nPrabhupada explains that Lord Brahma is like the gardener: the gardener doesn\u2019t produce the seeds; he just takes the seeds and plants them and cultivates the garden. So the seed-giving father is Krsna. Aham bija-pradah pita, as Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita, \u201cI am the seed-giving father of all living beings\u201d. \nSo the seed is from Krsna, but Lord Brahma took those seeds and therefore he, as a secondary creator, created the material bodies, and then Krsna, or Maha Visnu, impregnates the living entities into the material nature by His glance, after which activity will begin. After creation as we know, Lord Visnu takes the responsibility for maintenance of this material universe, and Lord Siva takes the responsibility for annihilation.\nAs we said in the beginning, because Brahma was impregnated with this mantra he was empowered to perform his duty selflessly. In fact, in the third canto of the Bhagavatam, when it describes Lord Brahma\u2019s prayers for creative potency, he was praying to the Lord for that potency to create. It's explained that Lord Brahma, now that he understood that creation was his purpose, now his next step, because he was a Vaisnava who received Krsna mantra, as Prabhupada explained here in the commentary. Let\u2019s read exactly how Prabhupada put it. He said,\n\u201c\u2026 Thus Brahma was initiated by the Krsna mantra, by Lord Krsna Himself, and thus he became a Vaisnava, or a devotee of the Lord, before he was able to construct the huge universe\u2026\u201d (SB 2.9.6, part of the purport)\nTherefore, as a Vaisnava he wanted to know how to create the universe and not become entangled. I mean that is pretty tall order if we think about it. If we try to imagine our tiny capacity to create something, and in comparison to Lord Brahma\u2019s capacity to create something our capacity is very insignificant. As we know, our creations are very small and limited. But just imagine if we create something very wonderful, our immediate propensity is to think, Look what I created. Look what I did. I built a house.\u201d Or, I built something else. But nonetheless the point is, as soon as we create something immediately we think, \u201cI created it. I did it. And because I was the brain behind it, how can I derive the most benefit from my creation? Should I sell it? Make a lot of money? It\u2019s a good invention. It\u2019s a nice house. Should I sell it? Should I live in it and enjoy it? How should I use it?\u201d\nBut Lord Brahma, even he knew that it was a very tall order that was requested of him by the Lord, he was immediately thinking, \u201cBefore I do this, before I create it, the best I understand how to create it and not become entangled, so that I can fulfill my primary responsibility as a Vaisnava, which is to be selflessly engaged in the service of the Lord, without any desire for profit or gain.\u201d\nAs Prabhupada also alludes to that point here at the end of the commentary,\n\u201c\u2026One who is thus initiated in the disciplic succession is able to achieve the same result or power of creation. Chanting of this holy mantra is the only shelter of the desireless pure devotee of the Lord. Simply by such tapasya, or penance, the devotee of the Lord achieves all perfections like Lord Brahma.\u201d (SB 2.9.6, part of the purport)\nSo, first and foremost, is being the desireless pure devotee of the Lord. And the disereless pure devotee of the Lord can do anything for the service of the Lord, including creating a universe. Therefore, Lord Brahma took the initiation he received as his top priority to manifest the characteristics of being a pure devotee of the Lord, not his creation as the top priority. Top priority is to do creation but to be unmotivated, and without any interest to enjoy or become entangled in it. \nThat is the successful execution of devotional service. That is empowerment. That is the seed which is given in the Vedic mantra to Lord Brahma, and which is also the seed which is given through disciplic succession to the devotee who takes that as the top priority in all that he does in the execution of devotional service, how to selflessly perform that service without becoming entangled. And there is that commentary in the third canto of the Bhagavatam, \n\u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead then said: O Brahma, O depth of Vedic wisdom, be neither depressed nor anxious about the execution of creation. What you are begging from Me has already been granted before.\u201d (SB 3.9.29)\nBrahma was begging for being empowered to create and not to be entangled. So, Prabhupada says in the purport,\n\u201cAny person authorized by either the Lord or by His bona fide representative is already blessed, as is the work entrusted to him\u2026\u201d (SB 3.9.29, part of the purport)\nIn another words, if a person is authorized by the Lord, the Lord has already impregnated in his instructions all the potencies to carry it out. It\u2019s already been blessed. It\u2019s already there the ability to carry it out successfully, or the potency to carry it out successfully is already there in the instruction. One simply has to selflessly take the instruction. Therefore Prabhupada says, \n\u201cAny person authorized by either the Lord or by His bona fide representative is already blessed, as is the work entrusted to him. Of course, the person entrusted with such a responsibility should always be aware of his incapability and must always look for the mercy of the Lord for the successful execution of his duty\u2026\u201d (SB 3.9.29, continuation of the purport)\nLord Brahma was entrusted responsibility to create, and similarly anyone who is in the disciplic succession from Lord Brahma and who is receiving some instruction from his bona fide representative to accept some responsibility, such person should always be aware of his incapability. Incapability means that \"My ability to do it is simply because I\u2019ve gotten the order. Without the order I can\u2019t do anything.\" One has to be very, very careful if one actually wants to consider what is empowerment. Krsna-sakti vina nahe tara pravartana. Empowerment means that it comes down through the order to take responsibility. Just like Lord Caitanya says, \nyare dekha, tare kaha \u2018krsna-upadesa\namara ajnaya guru hana tara\u2019 ei desa\n\u201cInstruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Sri Krsna as they are given in the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land.\u201d (CC, Madhya, 7.128)\nHe is giving instruction to all living beings to tell everybody about Krsna. Potency is there in the order, and if one selflessly follows the order, with the desire to please the Lord and the representative of the Lord who delivers that order in the disciplic succession, then the empowerment comes through the order. That my capability is because I am a servant and I\u2019ve received an order. And therefore Prabhupada is explaining that \"one must always look for the mercy of the Lord for success in the execution of his duty\u201d.\n\u201c\u2026 One should not be puffed up because he is entrusted with certain executive work. Fortunate is he who is so entrusted, and if he is always fixed in the sense of being subordinate to the will of the Supreme, he is sure to come out successful in the discharge of his work\u2026\u201d (SB 3.9.29, continuation of the purport)\nSo, he is always conscious that he is subordinate. Not the enjoyer. Not the beneficiary in any respect of his activities. In other words, there should be no interest of personal gain, and then one can be sufficiently detached from the responsible service which has been given to him. \nSomeone may say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any responsible service. Why I have to be conscious of being subordinate to Krsna?\u201d But still, Lord Rsabhadeva has explained that anyone who\u2019s accepted human birth is responsible to utilize the human form of life to his full potential. Lord Rsabhadeva in instructions to his sons says, \ntapo divyam putraka yena sattvam\nsuddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam\n\u201cLord Rsabhadeva told His sons: My dear boys, of all the living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool. One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service. By such activity, one's heart is purified, and when one attains this position, he attains eternal, blissful life, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.\u201d (SB 5.5.1)\n\nAnd Prabhupada explains that this ta-pa, this austerity is the responsibility of anyone who has accepted a human body. Lord Rsabhadeva says that and Prabhupada explains in the commentary, but Lord Rsabhadeva says right here in the verse,\n\u201c\u2026 all the living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool\u2026\u201d (SB 5.5.1)\nHe is explaining that there are so many living entities accepting material bodies, the animals, the hogs, the dogs, camels and asses, but for one who\u2019s been awarded the human form of life he should not waste it like the lower forms of life. Therefore, responsibility of human form of life is, as Lord Rsabhadeva says, to voluntarily accept ta-pa. Tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam.\nSo, someone may say, \u201cI don\u2019t have any responsibilities. I\u2019ve been able to avoid responsibilities. If I had any responsibilities and if I would be accountable, I would be answerable to somebody. But I don\u2019t have any responsible work.\u201d But, if one has a human form of life, one can\u2019t easily get out of it. Responsibility is still there. And the result is that if one doesn\u2019t takes responsibility for human form of life, we all know consequences. We don\u2019t have to go down to that line. \nWe understand the consequences for one who is a miserly person, who wastes valuable human form of life, which is meant for voluntarily accepting austerities and penances to achieve the divine position of devotional service. And consequences are already arranged: the agency of material nature, of which Lord Brahma is a very active participant. He\u2019s created all different alternatives for those who don\u2019t want to use the human form of life to its full potential. That was his service. That was his service entrusted to him by the Supreme Lord\u2014 to create all the different varieties of life, for all the different species of life as alternatives for those who didn\u2019t want to accept the responsibility of the human form of life. They are all there, they are available. \nSo, Lord Brahma executed his duties perfectly, successfully. He accepted his responsibilities. And as we know, after Lord Brahma finishes his work in this world then at the end of his life, for serving the Lord successfully, he returns. And for anyone who accepts human form of life by voluntarily accepting austerities and penances to achieve the divine position of devotional service, he also can be successful in his human form of life, in the responsibility he has in this life, and he can also end his sojourn in the material world and go back to the spiritual world.\nSo, when Srila Prabhupada uses the word \u201cresponsibility\u201d in this verse, he is not saying \u201cOk, somebody who\u2019s got a big executive position.\u201d He is actually speaking about anybody who\u2019s supposed to be taking responsibility in life. As we said, there are many responsibilities: the human being has the responsibility for maintaining the body, for maintaining family members, and many other responsibilities towards the body. But these are secondary responsibilities. They are called gauna-dharma. And they are supposed to be a support for the primary responsibility. \nAnd for anyone who\u2019s received the mantra in disciplic succession, the primary responsibility is his spiritual life. The primary responsibility is to become purely motivated to become a qualified servant of the Lord, to become desireless. That is the primary responsibility, and all these secondary responsibilities that he has, whatever responsibility that may be, they are all meant to be a support to help him stay in this human body so that he can fulfill life\u2019s purpose, to go back home, back to Godhead at the end of his life.\nSo, one who wastes the human form of life, he is responsible. It is not like, \u201cOk, I am a devotee, I\u2019ve received mantra. I\u2019ve given free ticket.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t work that way. It doesn\u2019t work. Human life is meant for responsibilities. There is no free ride. And if we don\u2019t take responsibility, Lord Brahma has already arranged the consequences in the material world \u2013 another birth. \nOf course, as we know, whatever devotional service is performed in this life is never lost. And if one takes birth in next life, he may continue. Prabhupada always emphasized, \u201cWhy? Why should one want to stay and continue?\u201d\nI always think of that one famous question when the young boy asked Prabhupada, \u201cPrabhupada, if I don\u2019t go back to Godhead in this life, will you come back and get me?\u201d And Prabhupada said, \u201cYes. But don\u2019t take advantage of it. Don\u2019t make your spiritual master come back.\u201d And then Prabhupada explained, \u201cBe responsible. Fulfill your responsibilities in this life.\u201d So, yes, the spiritual master will come back, and give you instructions, but you still have to follow them. It is not like he is going to come back and just say, \u201cOk. That\u2019s it. You were my disciple in your last life. Now, I am going to take you home.\u201d No! He comes back in the form of instruction again, to help you again to take responsibility.\nJust like, example is, when Bilvamangala Thakura took the prostitute as his spiritual master, when she instructed him, \u201cO, you have come here simply to enjoy me. But consider how much endeavor you\u2019ve made to come and enjoy me. But if you used that same energy to go to the Lord\u2026\u201d And immediately, Bilvamangala Thakura accepted her as spiritual master, and immediately renounced everything and went to Vrndavana. So, he took the responsibility of the human form of life that was given to him. It\u2019s not like spiritual master will say, \u201cOk, I am going to come and give free pass.\u201d Free ride. No!! He will come and remind, instruct \u2013 but we still have to take the responsibility.\nPrabhupada always says, \u201cWhy waste time? Why? You can get to destination by walking up 100 stairs, but if there is an elevator going up, why don\u2019t you take it?\u201d So, same thing, same principle is with responsibility. Sooner or later, one has to realize that this responsibility is entrusted to me and I have to accept it - especially for those who received the mantra in disciplic succession. And that\u2019s Prabhupada\u2019s point here: for one who has received the mantra in disciplic succession this is the responsibility.\nPrabhupada says in purport that \u201cupasrnot\u201d was the word that was used: it means \u201che heard that sound nearby\u201d. And Prabhupada equated the word \u201cupasrnot\u201d with \u201cupanayana\u201d, which means to be near to the spiritual master, to be close to the spiritual master. He is referring for one who\u2019s received diksa-mantra from the spiritual master, it brings him closer to the spiritual master. He is nearby. He is closer. He is ready to help, to give instructions to bring one to Krsna.\nSo, anyone who\u2019s received that mantra than he has the duty, as Lord Brahma had the duty to become qualified to fulfill his responsibilities in this world in a selfless way. Let me continue reading about this point how one should not be puffed up. Prabhupada says,\n\u201c\u2026 One should not be puffed up because he is entrusted with certain executive work. Fortunate is he who is so entrusted, and if he is always fixed in the sense of being subordinate to the will of the Supreme, he is sure to come out successful in the discharge of his work. Arjuna was entrusted with the work of fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, and before he was so entrusted, the Lord had already arranged for his victory \u2026\u201d (SB 3.9.29, continuation of the purport)\nIn another words, he was already blessed. The Lord already arranged for Arjuna\u2019s victory. Arjuna only had to say, \u201cOk, I will accept your order as divine and simply execute it according to your will\u201d, and then victory is already arranged by the Lord. \u201cArjuna, you simply become an instrument and fulfill My decision, My arrangement that I\u2019ve already made. You can either take part, or not take part. If you take part, I will arrange that you will even get credit for taking part and people will see what benefit one gets when one surrenders to the Lord. So you could be an example for others. So, I am very happy for you to get the credit.\u201d So, Prabhupada is using the example of Arjuna,\n\u201c\u2026 Arjuna was entrusted with the work of fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, and before he was so entrusted, the Lord had already arranged for his victory. But Arjuna was always conscious of his position as subordinate to the Lord, and thus he accepted Him as the supreme guide in his responsibility\u2026\u201d (SB 3.9.29, continuation of the purport)\nOf course, Arjuna was always conscious of his subordinate position to the Lord, so when the Lord instructed Arjuna he became the Lord\u2019s disciple. Sisyas te 'ham sadhi mam tvam prapannam. \u201cNow I am disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You.\u201d\nPrabhupada explains in the eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavad-gita in commentary that we should not think, \u201cWell, I am not getting any direct order from the Lord, therefore how can I derive the same benefit as Arjuna?\u201d And Prabhupada makes it very clear that just as Arjuna got it from the Lord, anybody in the disciplic succession can also become consciously subordinate to the superior instruction coming down through disciplic succession, and receive the same benefit as Arjuna did by receiving instructions directly from the Lord. \nHe makes that point in the commentary to the verse where Krsna says to Arjuna, \u201cIn all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service be fully conscious of Me. If you are conscious of Me, you will cross over all the obstacles of conditional life by My grace. But if you do not act in such consciousness and act in false ego, not hearing from Me you will be lost.\u201d \nAnd Prabhupada explains in the commentary that the same benefit Arjuna got for being conscious of his subordinate position to Krsna is available to anybody who accepts the instructions of the spiritual master in disciplic succession, and who acts in a conscious way of being subordinate to those instructions, always remembering that the potency to perform his responsible work in this world is being entrusted to him through disciplic succession which is coming down through the divine order. \nPrabhupada always attributed his success to the order of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta. There was no doubt. Prabhupada always made it clear that, \u201cWhatever success I have in this Krsna Consciousness Movement is simply because my spiritual master blessed me. He sent all of you to me, to help me to serve his order.\u201d He was always, again and again, emphasizing this point, never thinking, \u201cLook what I have done!\u201d\nI remember even once there was a story. I can\u2019t remember who told me. Prabhupada was standing in front of the mirror, and he saw his reflection in the mirror and said, \u201cLook what my spiritual master has created.\u201d Someone may think, \u201cOh, what a vain statement.\" There was no vanity in it, whatsoever. But he was simply thinking that, \u201cThis is by the potency of my spiritual master. What he can do by his will, by his instruction, by his desire!\u201d And Prabhupada again and again was always thinking in that way, because he was always conscious of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta\u2019s orders, always conscious of his instructions, always conscious of his subordinate position to both the spiritual master and to the Supreme Lord. Therefore he was so successful. And that\u2019s the point he is making here. He says that,\n\u201c\u2026 But Arjuna was always conscious of his position as subordinate to the Lord, and thus he accepted Him as the supreme guide in his responsibility. Anyone who takes pride in doing responsible work but does not give credit to the Supreme Lord is certainly falsely proud and cannot execute anything nicely\u2026\u201d (SB 3.9.29, continuation of the purport)\nIn other words, externally may look very nice but actually it\u2019s doomed to failure. It\u2019s doomed to failure, including our responsibility in the human life. Externally it may look very nice, \u201cOh, I am making money. I have a lot of followers. So many people like me. I have a lot of friends. I am comfortable.\u201d Externally it may look so nice, but if he is not conscious of his subordinate position to the Lord, Prabhupada says, it\u2019s doomed to failure. It will just look nice outside, but when it comes down to the final result the Lord will not be pleased, spiritual master will not be pleased, and neither our human life will be fulfilled in any way, shape or form. It will not be crowned with success, because of being falsely proud. That is the danger of pride. Prabhupada says, \u201ccertainly falsely proud and cannot execute anything nicely.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Brahma and persons in the line of his disciplic succession who follow in his footsteps are always successful in the discharge of loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord.\u201d (SB 3.9.29, the end of the purport)\nI didn\u2019t expect to speak so long. But I do have other things I have to do, and we will end here. Hare Krsna. All glories to Prabhupada!\n\n[Guru Maharaja ends lecture here]\n","nid":"5127"},{
"title":"Transcription of a Sunday Lecture given in Budapest on October 9, 2011, entitled \"The Most Satisfying Relationship\"","ref":{"target_id":"4374"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Budapest"],"date":"Mon, 2011-11-28 15:23","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially-edited transcription of a Sunday lecture given in Budapest on October 9, 2011.\n\nThis afternoon I've been asked to speak about something in connection with chanting of holy name.\nIs anybody here for the first time? \nWelcome!\nThank you for coming.\nI will try to speak in such a way that everybody will understand. \nAlthough we are talking about the holy name, there is so much to be said. There is one song, harinama eva kevalam, which means that the holy name of Lord Hari is everything. So, I guess there is a lot that can be said, if we look from that point of view. Some people may have difficult time understanding how the Lord's holy name \"Hari\" is everything. But for those who have been chanting the holy name of Lord Hari, and have heard about and understood the primary goal which is to be achieved by chanting of the holy name of the Lord, then they can gradually understand how the Lord's holy name \"Sri Hari\" is everything. \nChanting Hare Krishna is a form of prayer, and because that is one of the purposes for chanting the holy name of the Lord, we are going to speak a little bit about that aspect today. I selected a short reference to speak from in this connection, and I ask all of you to first hear it, and then if you have questions about what has been read, hopefully after my presentation, it will be more understandable and your questions will be answered. But I can't assure you that during the course of my talk I will be able to answer all of the questions that may come. So I'll leave time for asking them afterwards.\nI'm reading from the words of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Thakur, who is the spiritual master of our spiritual master, His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada. And, as I said, we are going to read about prayer. He answers the question, \"How should we call the Supreme Lord.\"\n\"Sri Gaurasundara taught us that in order to chant the Lord's holy names, we must become lower than the straw on the street. Unless we consider ourselves insignificant, we cannot call upon another for help. Only when we pray for another's help, do we consider ourselves helpless. In such a state of mind we think that without another's help we will be unable to do anything. We will feel that impossible to do that thing alone which is meant to be done by five people. \nSri Gaurasundara has instructed us to chant the Lord's names. We get this information from our spiritual master. To chant the Lord's names means to take His help. But while chanting if we consider Him our servant, or expect Him to do our work, then there is no question of our living in the conception \"I am lower than the straw on the street\". \nAn external display of humility is not necessarily genuine humility but cheating. Our call will not reach the Lord if we call Him as a master calls his servants. He is supremely independent and not under anyone's control. Unless we transform our false ego and become sincerely humble, our prayers will not reach the supreme independent Lord. \nOne more point. We have to remember that while humbly chanting the Lord's name, if we do not become tolerant our chanting will remain imperfect. If we display our intolerance by being greedy for particular objects then we are opposing the principle of humility. If we have complete faith that the Supreme Lord is the Absolute Truth and by chanting His names we will not experience poverty, we will have no lack of tolerance. As soon as we become greedy and try to exhibit our impatience or our own skill, we cannot call the Supreme Lord properly. \nWe often think we are doing the Lord a favor by offering Him prayers\u2014 that we could have engaged in some other activity than the chanting of the Lord's names. Such a mentality is an example of a lack of tolerance. We need someone to protect us from such a mentality, someone to help us to become lower than the straw on the street\".\nI will stop here. \nSo this reference, as we said, answers the question, \"How should we call the Supreme Lord?\" Chanting the Hare Krsna mahamantra is calling out to Him, to Krsna. Therefore it is described here as a form of prayer. We are calling out for His attention. But what do we want?\nOftentimes people, in times of need, will call or pray to the Lord for help. It's natural for somebody who believes in the existence of a supreme being to call for help. There's a well-known saying that there are no atheists in foxholes. That is a difficult situation. When your fate is a matter of life or death, certainly it is commonplace to call out, or to pray, \"Please protect me.\" Chanting Hare Krsna is a prayer for protection. \nOur spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada, used to give the example that when one is chanting Hare Krsna, one should chant like a child calling for his mother. That mood is a state of helplessness. The young child knows nothing but his mother who always comes, lifts him up and comforts him. A baby doesn't know any other process for relief. This is his only experience. He would be calling out, crying in this way and his mother comes and lifts. So there is nothing artificial in this calling out of the baby. It's a natural call, a natural cry for the mother. \nSo Srila Prabhupada said that the chanting of Hare Krsna should be done in this mood. It's a call for protection. But the protection the Lord is inclined to give may not necessarily fit into our expectations because our connection with the Supreme Lord is not simply based upon this body. Our connection with the Lord goes far beyond the existence of this temporary body. \nIn \"Bhagavad Gita\" Krsna says, aham bija-pradah pita, \"I am the seed giving father of all living beings,\" which means that our life, our very existence is completely dependent upon the Supreme. And the primary or basic ABC's of spiritual life is based on the understanding that life has its existence beyond this body. So our connection with the Supreme Lord therefore is not dependent upon this body. Although the Supreme Lord provides all necessities of life for all living beings.\nThere are many verses in the scriptures which give evidence how the Lord provides everything for all livings beings. For example, we said that Krsna is the father of all living entities. We naturally think of the father as the provider. So with that same understanding we see that the Lord is providing the necessities of life for all living beings\u2014all species of life\u2014not only those in human form of life. But we must understand with the proper vision what are the real necessities of life. Our tendency is to think that if the Lord is our father, providing all necessities of life, then certainly if I call out for Him for the necessities of life, and if He hears my prayer, then I have hope that he'll provide all that I need. \nSo, as we said, our connection with the Lord and the Lord's answer to our prayers will not necessarily come according to our expectations. Why? Because life has its own necessities beyond the necessities of the body. Although we oftentimes think that the necessities of life are food, shelter, clothing, and good health, etc., these are not the real necessities of life. These are necessary for maintaining life in the body. But as we said, the basic principle, or the ABC's of spiritual life is to know that life exists beyond this body and that life has its own necessities which have nothing to do with the body. Providing these necessities is the way the Supreme Lord answers the prayers of those who are genuinely seeking protection. \nNow, Krsna says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham, \"To the degree that you approach Me, I will reciprocate with you accordingly.\" If somebody wants protection to maintain life in the body, but is not concerned about the protection of life, Krsna can reciprocate on that platform as well. One may feel protected by getting what he needs to maintain life within the body, but it is understood that whatever one achieves in this world in connection with this body and this world, is temporary. It may give temporary satisfaction to the body, but still it lacks satisfaction for the self, which has its own necessities and which has nothing to do with gratifying the needs of the body. Oftentimes people become bewildered. Even those who have so much facility to gratify the needs of the body, they are still not satisfied. \nDevamrita Maharaja was speaking last night about loneliness. He described how in today's society, even though people have so many things they identify with and so many material comforts and necessities, inside they are very lonely people. Having established their relationship with dead matter they feel so lonely because they don't know how to relate with each other as persons, especially those who are selfish, just thinking of others as a facility to satisfy their material necessities of life. They have a very one-sided relationship with the world. Even though they may give, they give with the intention of gaining. \nThat is exactly the point which Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Thakur was speaking about in this reference. He says when we try to establish our relationship with the Lord, then the Lord can give everything. He can give all material necessities; it's not very difficult for the person who possesses everything to give material necessities. And Krsna is the possessor of everything. \nisavasyam idam sarvam\nyat kinca jagatyam jagat\ntena tyaktena bhunjitha\nma grdhah kasya svid dhanam\nTRANSLATION\n\"Everything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord. One should therefore accept only those things necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota, and one should not accept other things, knowing well to whom they belong.\" (Isopanisad, Mantra 1)\nIn another words, one should live in this world in such a way that he understands that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord and he should take those things for himself which are prescribed as his quota. \nSo the Lord can provide all these necessities of life very easily. In fact, everyone is already being maintained by the Supreme Lord. So if the Lord can give everything, why should one only approach the Lord for material necessities? Srila Bhaktisiddhanta is explaining this point\u2014 that if you want a relationship with the supreme Lord, then don't approach Him as if you are the master, and He is your servant. He says right here, that that will not lead to a very wholesome relationship. He says, a person should feel helpless and dependent upon the Lord, but in that feeling of helplessness the Lord is inclined to give something much more than simply the material necessities of life. He wants to have a relationship with us. He wants to give Himself. If one possesses everything in this world, than certainly the person who owns all of these material necessities must be greater than the necessities themselves. \nTherefore, if you simply want some material necessities, He can give. But He has got something much better in His \"back pocket,\" and He is waiting to give that to us. But if we say, \"No, all I want is that, all I want is that\", then Krsna will say, \"Ok, to the degree that you want something from Me, I will give it to you. To the degree you surrender to Me, I will reward you accordingly. Do you want the relationship with Me? Or you simply want what I can give you?\" \nWe can think of this as an example. For a person who has a lot of wealth, it's very difficult for him to know who his friends are. He is always wondering, \"Is this person interested in me, or he is interested in my money? Do they care about me, or are they just being really nice because they want something?\" \"Oh, you are so nice, we like you! Can I feed you? Can we give you some gifts?\" Sometimes, when you are a wealthy person, so many people are ready to give you anything. But he is wealthy man, what is the need of all these things for him? People are doing so much for him, but he is always wondering, \"Why? What do they want? Is there some other reason behind their service; their offerings to me?\" They ask, \"So do you care about me, really?' Of course, they won't ask this question. They just think this way in the back of their minds. \nBut Krsna doesn't have to ask \"Do you care about Me or care about my opulences\", because He already knows. Nothing can be hidden from Him. He is sitting within everyone's heart, and He knows their motives. He knows their desires. He doesn't have to wait and think, \"What is the purpose of all this? How long do I have to wait for this person to show his real colors?\" He already knows. \nJust like, the example is given that Krsna knows the desires in the heart of every living being just as a person can know the fragrance of a flower just by being close to it. So Krsna already knows why we are approaching Him. We can't fool Him. He sees everything. He is the all-pervasive Supersoul in the heart of every living being. He knows exactly what we are thinking, our intentions, our moods, our motives. Krsna is ready to give Himself, but we just going for very insignificant things which have no real connection with the self. We think that we are fooling Him, but we are cheating ourselves. He is ready to give Himself, He is ready to have a relationship, and not only a relationship here in this world, but to establish a relationship and to share the pleasure He experiences in that relationship with Him beyond this world. \nSo therefore, why should we simply approach Krsna for material necessities of life when He can give something far greater? Krsna can satisfy all desires. And He can give us the most meaningful relationship with Himself\u2014a relationship based on love. The most powerful thing in this world is love. It's what attracts Krsna \u2013 to have the relationship with somebody. Krsna in \"Bhagavad Gita\" says, \npatram puspam phalam toyam\nyo me bhaktya prayacchati\ntad aham bhakty-upahrtam\nasnami prayatatmanah\nTRANSLATION\n\"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.\" (BG 9.26)\nWhy is He interested in a leaf, a flower, fruit or water? He possesses everything. Why therefore would He want them? Because of the love, the most important ingredient which attracts the Supreme Lord is the love. But if there is no love, we cannot feel His reciprocation. \nIn one verse of the \"Bhagavatam\" Prahlada Maharaj is speaking to his friends. \nnalam dvijatvam devatvam\nrsitvam vasuratmajah\nprinanaya mukundasya\nna vrttam na bahu-jnata\nna danam na tapo nejya\nna saucam na vratani ca\npriyate 'malaya bhaktya\nharir anyad vidambanam\nTRANSLATION\n\"My dear friends, O sons of the demons, you cannot please the Supreme Personality of Godhead by becoming perfect brahmanas, demigods or great saints or by becoming perfectly good in etiquette or vast learning. None of these qualifications can awaken the pleasure of the Lord. Nor by charity, austerity, sacrifice, cleanliness or vows can one satisfy the Lord. The Lord is pleased only if one has unflinching, unalloyed devotion to Him. Without sincere devotional service, everything is simply a show.\" (SB 7.7.51-52)\nSo Prahlada Maharaja, a five years old boy, is speaking to his classmates. He is telling them, everything you do, if there is no love, the Lord isn't interested in looking. Whatever you don won't get His attention. Even if you perform great austerities, the Lord is not impressed. Big sacrifices \u2013 not impressed. This thing still does not impress Him. Krsna says, \nyat karosi yad asnasi\nyaj juhosi dadasi yat\nyat tapasyasi kaunteya\ntat kurusva mad-arpanam\nTRANSLATION\n\"Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform -- do that, O son of Kunti, as an offering to Me.\" (BG 9.27)\nWhy does the Lord want us to do something for Him? Because He needs it? No! We are cheating ourselves if we don't do it for Him. \nWhen one offers something to the Supreme Lord with love, then automatically he is benefitted. Prahlada Maharaja also gives the example \u2013 just like a person when decorating her face in a mirror, automatically the reflection is decorated. They don't have to make any separate endeavor to decorate the reflection. Unless there is something wrong with a mirror. Similarly, when you give something to the Lord with love, then you are benefiting. You don't have to do something for yourself when you do something for the Lord with love; because the Lord is so attracted by the offering that He wants to give something in return. It gets his attention. But even if you perform austerities, great vows, chastity, great sacrifices \u2013 none of these things will get His attention if there is no love. \nSo therefore when a person prays to the Lord, real protection from Him is the opportunity to serve Him. He will protect us from all the things in this world which make us forget that we are His servants. That is real protection. Because the most dangerous circumstance in this world is to forget the Lord. \nnehabhikrama-naso 'sti\npratyavayo na vidyate\nsv-alpam apy asya dharmasya\ntrayate mahato bhayat\nTRANSLATION\nIn this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear. (BG 2.40)\n This is real protection. What is the most dangerous type of fear? To forget that I am an eternal servant of Krsna, and therefore being to become motivated simply to have a connection only to this world, which is temporary. Krsna Himself has certified this place as temporary and full of miseries. \nmam upetya punar janma\nduhkhalayam asasvatam\nnapnuvanti mahatmanah\nsamsiddhim paramam gatah\nTRANSLATION\n\"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.\" (BG 8.15)\nThis material world is simply temporary and filled with so much of miseries. So why should one go to the Lord for temporary relief of distress when that relief will only be taken away anyway in due to the course of time. An intelligent person will look for a more serious solution and will pray to the Lord not as a master calling out to a servant, but in the consciousness that, \"I am a servant, and my objective is to please the Supreme Lord, who is my Supreme Master.\" \nWhen a devotee chants the holy name of the Lord in this state of mind, in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw on the street, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respects to others \u2013 in such a state of mind one can always chant the holy name of the Lord. \nThis is the attitude and consciousness that a practitioner of Krsna consciousness develops while chanting Krsna's name. In this humble state of mind, thinking, as Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati is referring to here. \"Actually I do not deserve anything. I simply desire to render some service to the Supreme Lord and please Him. And that is all that I am interested in, that is all that I want.\" When a devotee chants in this mood, the Lord is very much attracted to such prayer. He will always take notice of such prayer. He will think, \"This person is depending upon Me, he is not depending on anything else.\" If somebody is depending on some other thing, then why should the Lord intervene? The Lord will think, \"He is depending on so many other things, he doesn't want me.\"\nIt's like that story of Draupadi, when she was asking, \"Krsna, why did it take so long to protect me, to protect my honor?\" When the Kauravas were trying to disrobe her and to dishonor her in the assembly, Krsna explained that, \"When they were trying to disrobe you, first you were thinking Bhisma will protect you.\" Since Bhisma was the senior member of the assembly, Draupadi was looking to Bhisma for protection. \"But when you saw that Bhisma could not do anything then you turned to your husbands.\" Draupadi was married to the Pandavas, they were all her husbands, but they could not do anything either. She was looking at them \u2013 \"Why aren't you protecting?\" They could not do anything. Krsna then said, \"Then you thought that you can protect yourself by your own strength, and you held on to your sari thinking, \"By my own strength, I will try to protect my honor.\" \"But what was your strength in comparison to Duhsasana's strength? Nothing! You could not do it, you could not protect yourself. But only when you realized \u2013 'I have no one but You, Govinda', you then let go of your sari, put your hands in the air, and called out my name \u2013 'He, Govinda!' Then I provided everything you needed.\" \nSo this is how we call out when everything else we've realized can't give us protection. Our wealth cannot give us protection, and our family members are all fallible soldiers. They cannot give protection. \nJust like Prahlada Maharaj also says, \nbalasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha\nnartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh\ntaptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihanjasestas\ntavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam\nTRANSLATION\n\"My Lord Nrsimha-deva, O Supreme, because of a bodily conception of life, embodied souls neglected and not cared for by You cannot do anything for their betterment. Whatever remedies they accept, although perhaps temporarily beneficial, are certainly impermanent. For example, a father and mother cannot protect their child, a physician and medicine cannot relieve a suffering patient, and a boat on the ocean cannot protect a drowning man.\" (SB 7.9.19)\nPrahlada Maharaja is giving these examples. He is praying to the Lord. The embodied souls who are in the bodily conception of life, they are neglected by the Supreme Lord, in the sense they get temporarily benefits. They are not permanent, they are temporarily beneficial. And he gives examples \u2013 just like the most expert physician, what guarantee is there even if you have the most expert physician that he is going to cure you? \nJust like a person may have a terminal illness and then a doctor comes and says, \"We've found some medicine on the other side of the planet, we've found a doctor who knows how to administer it, and he is coming here.\" So the patient may feel some benefit. \"I've got the best doctor! I've got the best medicine!\" But does that mean that patient won't die? He may be feeling temporarily benefited thinking, \"I've got the best doctor and the best medicine\", but it doesn't mean he will not die. \nSo Prahlada Maharaja is giving this example that if you don't depend on the Lord, but depend on anything but Him, what guarantee is there for your protection? It is not guaranteed that protection will be here in this world. But if within your heart, you call out exclusively to the Lord, \"Only you, Krsna, only You can engage me in Your service, please, let me serve You, and let me have a relationship with You,\" then the Lord is very much inclined to reciprocate with such prayer, because He knows that we are not depending on anything other than Him. He can't neglect him. He is the Supreme Lord, how then can He neglect anybody who only depends on Him? \nSomebody can say, \"So many people sincerely called out Lord's names, and they were not protected,\". But that means we are still thinking according to the old psychology. We don't know how they were protected. Because somebody died, does it mean the Lord didn't protect him? No, life has its own necessity, and that necessity is between the Lord and His devotee. The Lord knows how to protect His devotees. \nSo we should not always think protection is according to our preconceived criteria \u2013 \"Protection means to protect my body, and all these things that the body needs.\" No. Protection means Krsna protects me, and He cares about me, not because of my wealth, not because of my power, not because of my fame, not because of anything else that I offer Him. Krsna can't be fooled. He knows when we want relationship with Him, and He knows how to protect such a devotee better than anyone else. \nThat is how to chant Hare Krsna in that mood, and that is what Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur is recommending here in this reference. \nSo I went overtime. Hopefully I've answered your questions. Thank you very much. \nHare Krsna.\n","nid":"4479"},{
"title":"Giriraja's Service to Krsna","ref":"","attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Govardhana"],"date":"Fri, 2011-10-28 06:23","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially edited transcription of a talk given about Giriraja's service to Krsna on June 27, 2009, in New Vraja Dhama, on the occasion of New Vraja Dhama's First Annual Vrndavana Parikrama. The talk was given on \"Govardhana Hill\" in New Vraja Dhama.\n \nSo I have been requested to speak about learning devotion from Giriraja. If we want to learn about and understand devotional service, then we must obtain the mercy of a devotee of the Lord. Otherwise devotional service will always remain a great mystery. So even the gopis who are the greatest devotees of the Lord are thinking that \"If we want to obtain the fulfillment of our desires, then we should worship the devotee.\" So the gopis are thinking this way and they are the topmost devotees. \nWe've learned from Brhad Bhagavatamrita that they are the greatest receptacles of Krsna's mercy. But still the gopis are thinking \"We have this desire that we want fulfilled. We want to be able to meet Krsna and in order to be able to meet Krsna we must serve a devotee of Krsna.\"\nSo who did the gopis proclaim as the best devotee of Krsna? They proclaimed Giriraja as the best devotee. In Srimad Bhagavatam they have said, \"Of all the devotees, this Govardhana Hill is the best! O my friends, this hill supplies Krsna and Balarama, along with Their calves, cows and cowherd friends, with all kinds of necessities -- water for drinking, very soft grass, caves, fruits, flowers and vegetables. In this way the hill offers respects to the Lord. Being touched by the lotus feet of Krsna and Balarama, Govardhana Hill appears very jubilant.\" (SB 10.21.18)\nSo this is the meditation the gopis have. They are thinking that Giriraja is the best servant of Krsna. Hari-dasa-varyah. Giriraja is understood both as the greatest servant of Krsna and as Krsna Himself. He assumed this form of Govardhana Hill in order to accept all the offerings of the residents of Vrndavana. In this way, the Lord, after assuming this wonderful form, also simultaneously offered worship to that form.\nSivarama Maharaja was just saying that there is a special characteristic of Govardhana Hill here in New Vraja Dhama. Here we can walk on Him. But Lord Caitanya in Vrndavana, also established the principle that one should not walk on Govardhana Hill. He worshiped Govardhana as nondifferent than Krsna. \nFor three continuous years, Lord Caitanya carried a Govardhana sila and a gunja mala. He was given both of these from a devotee named Sankarananda Sarasvati. He would oftentimes take the sila and He would put it to His head, embrace it to His heart and He would bathe the sila with His tears. So in this way Lord Caitanya worshiped Giriraja as nondifferent from Krsna. \nAfter worshiping Him in this way, He gave both the sila and gunja mala to Raghunath das Goswami to worship and told him, \"Carefully worship this sila by offering water and offering tulasi and by so doing, intense love and greed will awaken within your heart.\"\nSo in this way, we understand Giriraja as being nondifferent from the Supreme Lord. But we want to see Giriraja specifically for the sake of developing our internal devotion, we want to see Giriraja also as hari-dasa-varyah, as a servant of the Lord. We should want to follow that principle that if we want the fulfillment of our desires, then we must render service to and we must worship a great devotee of the Lord. \nSo in this verse it is described how Giriraja is actually rendering service to the Lord by assisting Him in His pastimes. Yesterday we were describing how the Lord's internal potency assists the Lord in the facilitation of His desires to enjoy with His devotees. So in the same way, Giriraja also assists the Lord to facilitate His desire to reciprocate with His devotees. How does He serve the Lord? He serves the Lord by serving His devotees, the cowherd boys, and by serving the cows and calves all of whom are very, very dear to Krsna.\nGiriraja is providing so many opulences of Vrndavana for the service of the Supreme Lord. When we think of opulences, we think of something which is very great, very wonderful, and very lavish. But the opulences of Vrndavana are those items which serve the Lord and His devotees in His pastimes such as fresh water, which the Lord can take for drinking, for taking bath, and for washing His mouth after taking prasadam with His cowherd boy friends. \nGiriraja also provides very nice soft grasses for Krsna's cows. This grass is a very special aromatic grass that is very, very pleasing to the cows. The cows are very much inclined take only this grass on Govardhana Hill. That is one of the qualities of the grass on Govardhana Hill. It is so aromatic that it attracts Krsna's cows. \nAnother quality of the grass growing on Govardhana Hill is that it is very nourishing for Krsna's cows. In this way the cows never feel any hunger, disease, or fatigue. It is very soft grass; so soft that even in the summer when there is no rain, the cows never pierce their lips or tongues by chewing on the grass. The result is that the cows who eat this grass provide very aromatic and nourishing milk. \nMother Yasoda was very eager to personally take this milk from the cows who had eaten this special, aromatic grass. So she personally selected this milk in order to prepare some nice yogurt and butter for Krsna. In this way, she hoped that Krsna would stop going to the neighboring houses to steal their butter and yogurt.\nAlthough she was the queen of Vrndavana and she could have arranged for anybody to prepare this butter for Krsna, still she wanted to do it herself because she was thinking, \"They won't do it right.\"\nSo Govardhana provides this type of grass for Krsna's cows. Giriraja also provides very nice caves for Krsna and His cowherd boy friends to take shelter from the heat of the hot summer sun and to get out of the rain when it is raining. And although we know that the gopis here are seeing Giriraja in terms of the service He renders specifically to Krsna, Balarama, His cows, calves and cowherd boy friends, we know that those same caves also are very wonderful places where Krsna goes to meet with the gopis.\nThe gopis were speaking this way because they are seeing how Giriraja is a very intimate associate of Krsna. They are very eager to serve Him because they want to get Krsna's intimate association in the same way as Giriraja does.. \nSo Giriraja is also providing very nice fruits wonderful types of drinks, mangoes and pilu juice. Srila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur also explains in his commentary how Giriraja is providing smooth stones the cowherd boys can use as mirrors, and for sitting places where Krsna and His friends sit down to take their lunch. He also provides jewels to decorate the body. These are the opulences Giriraja is offering as seva, or service to the Supreme Lord. \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur has given us a very wonderful explanation of how the gopis were thinking about Giriraja. Once, the gopis were saying \"We have heard from Gargi (who is the daughter of Gargamuni) that without rendering service to a devotee one cannot get the fulfillment of one's desires. Therefore since Govardhana Hill is the best of all devotees, we should go to that place. Let us take our bath at Manasa Ganga and take darshan of Harideva.\"\nThis deity of Harideva manifested because of the intense feelings of separation the gopis had for Him there. Prior to that, the gopis were feeling a very intense separation from Krsna and they were standing at this place by Manasa Ganga, calling out the name, \"Harideva, Harideva, Harideva.\" Due to their intense desire to see Krsna, this deity manifested there and was called Harideva. From that day on the gopis would come there every day and would worship that Deity. \nThe gopis continued, \"Certainly our elders will have no objection to this.\" As we know, the gopis were always very concerned about what their elders would say if they were found associating with Krsna. But now the gopis were thinking \"How can they possibly complain if we simply go there and take darshan of Harideva. But while we are there, we will get the opportunity to see Krsna who will be with His cowherd boys friends on the slopes of Govardhana Hill.\nSo deciding upon this plan, the gopis glorified Govardhana because He fulfills the desires of Krsna and His companions and hopefully He would then fulfill their desires to meet Krsna. So this is the gopis' meditation. This is how they see Giriraja as the best of all the servants of Krsna because Giriraja facilitates all these pastimes of the Lord. \nGiriraja also served the Lord by manifesting Himself as an umbrella in order to protect His Vrndavana devotees who were being inundated by the torrential rains sent by Indra. In this way Giriraja facilitated another wonderful pastime of the Lord, bringing all of the devotees together in one place to be with Krsna. Although ordinarily, the devotees see Krsna differently according to the places they meet, the unique quality of this pastime is that all of the devotees were all with Krsna in one place at the same time.\nFor instance Mother Yasoda does not know that Krsna was somewhere other than in bed at night. She has her vatsalya prema and always sees everything connected to Krsna's being her young son. When Krsna would be in bed in the morning, Mother Yasoda would see scratches on His body and would think that these scratches were there because Krsna was not careful while He was out playing during the previous day, running into thorns and branches in the forest along with His friends. So in this way her vatsalya prema was never disturbed by thinking that Krsna was someplace else during the night. \nSo Mother Yasoda would see Krsna at home and she would also see Krsna when He was leaving to go off to the pasturing grounds in the morning. She would want to go with Krsna when He was going off to the pasturing grounds but Krsna wouldn't let her. \nMother Yasoda would make so many different excuses to prevent Krsna from going into the pasturing grounds. As He was leaving with His friends, she would stop Him to give Him something to eat. Then she would walk back towards the house and she would turn to look at Krsna finding another reason to go and to be with her son. Then she would return back to Him and she would adjust His clothing so that it would look proper. After doing that she would have to walk back towards the house, again anticipating Krsna's departure. But since she didn't want Krsna to leave, she would walk back to Him again and would tell all of His friends, \"Now protect my son and make sure that you stand on all sides and behind Him so that nothing dangerous happens to Him when He's in the forest and pasturing grounds. \nThen she would turn again to return to her home, but then she would find another reason to go to Him. But Krsna finally went and clasped her lotus feet and said, \"Mother, please go home. My friends are waiting.\" And Mother Yasoda would just stand there. It's described in the Brhad Bhagavatamrita how she appeared just like a painted picture or like a cow feeling separation from her calf as Krsna was turning around and walking into the pasturing grounds.\nBut in this Govardhana lila, when Krsna lifted Govardhana Hill, Giriraja facilitated such a wonderful pastime of arranging all of the devotees to be together in the same place for seven continuous days. So in this way, Giriraja is also facilitating the Lord's pastimes.\nSo we are worshiping and remembering Giriraja today as a great devotee of Lord Krsna. In this way we should understand that if we ever want to participate in the Lord's pastimes and if we want to be in the association of the Lord, then we must obtain the mercy of a devotee of the Lord. We can never obtain devotional service of the Lord without obtaining the mercy of Krsna's devotees. \nSo hopefully today we have learned a little about devotion to Lord Krsna by remembering Giriraja in His role as the greatest servant of Lord Krsna. If we worship and serve Giriraja we also can have hope within our hearts that we may obtain the association of Krsna some day in His eternal pastimes. \nOK. So we will stop here and let Lokanath Maharaja speak. Hare Krsna.\n","nid":"4361"},{

The verses spoken from were Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya Lila, Chapter 6, Verses 100-101.\n\npratiyuge karena krsna yuga-avatara \ntarka-nistha hrdaya tomara nahika vicara\nTRANSLATION Gopinatha Acarya continued, \"There is certainly an incarnation in every age, and such an incarnation is called the yuga-avatara. But your heart has become so hardened by logic and argument that you cannot consider all these facts.\nasan varnas trayo hy asya \ngrhnato 'nu-yugam tanuh \nsuklo raktas tatha pita \nidanim krsnatam gatah\nTRANSLATION \"'In the past, your son has had bodies of three different colors, according to the age. These colors were white, red and yellow. In this age [Dvapara-yuga] He has accepted a blackish body.'\nPURPORT This verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.8.13) was spoken by Garga Muni when he was performing the rituals at Lord Krsna's name-giving ceremony. He states that the incarnations of the Lord in other ages had been white, red and yellow. This yellow color refers to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, whose bodily complexion was yellowish. This confirms that in past Kali-yugas the Lord also had incarnated in a body that was yellow in hue. It is understood that the Lord incarnates in different colors for the different yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali). Accepting the color yellow (pita), as well as other characteristics, the Lord incarnated as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This is the verdict of all Vedic authorities.\nLecture begins\u2026\nSo we should probably put this verse into context. All of you who have been following these verses, probably understand exactly what is taking place. But there is also a tendency to forget and therefore maybe some of you have heard but have forgotten. Some of you may have not heard. So therefore we will put this verse into context before we speak about the point that Gopinath Acarya is making here.\nAs those of you who have heard the previous verses should know, Gopinath Acarya is speaking to Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya. Actually he's speaking to his students, because his students were objecting to the conclusions that Gopinath Acarya was presenting before them about the position of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\nAs we know, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya offered full respect to Lord Caitanya for being a sannyasa, but he was also a little wary about Lord Caitanya's capacity to keep his vows. That was one of his doubts. He thought that He is so young, he has not sufficiently studied Vedanta, it's quite possible that having accepted the renounced order of life so young, he may find some difficulties.\nSarvabhauma Bhattacarya also considered that Caitanya Mahaprabhu had accepted sannyasa from a lower sampradaya, the Bharati sampradaya. He also thought that he could help Lord Caitanya by offering Him to accept his renunciation vows again from him so that he could bring Him to a higher sampradaya\nIt was obvious that Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was not able to understand the position of Lord Caitanya because Lord Caitanya, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was not dependent upon any such formalities such as the acceptance of sannyasa from any particular sampradaya.\nTherefore Gopinath Acarya was arguing this point, \"Although the Supreme Lord is present in your home, you are not capable of recognizing Him.\" Then the students, who were very much inclined to be supportive of their teacher, who gave so much knowledge to them, started to speak out, objecting to the statements of Gopinath Acarya and challenging him. They specifically asked, \"OK, what's your evidence?\"\nIt is a valid request to ask for evidence from someone who makes such statements. However, there are different types of evidence. As we know, according to Vaisnava tradition, the strongest evidence is sabda-brahma, which is the evidence of the scriptures passed down by the apauruseya process\u2014transcendental knowledge from the spiritual source. There are other processes such as pratyaksa, or sense perception, and anumana, or hypothesis. These are the three primary sources of evidence. There are ten all together, but we really don't give so much emphasis on the other types of evidence.\nThere is traditon. Analogies are also considered to be a form of evidence. Conjecture is considered to be another type of evidence. Conjecture means that you draw a conclusion by negative hypothetical deduction. I'll give you an example of what conjecture is. This example is given in the Tattva Sandarbha. \"Devadatta is very fat. But no one ever sees Devadata eating during the day. Therefore conjecture means that Devadatta must be eating a lot at night. That's conjecture. So that's another type of evidence. Gesture is another type of evidence. I can't remember them all. But these are different types of evidence.\nBut primarily we are concerned about pratyaksa, anumana, and sabda. So therefore the students of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya said \"Give us your evidence,\" and then Gopinath Acarya began providing evidence from the scripture, which is considered to be very strong evidence especially when it's presented by someone whose pratyaksa, or sense perception, is clear. We know that pratyaksa is generally considered to be faulty evidence because the senses are imperfect.\nSrila Prabhupada makes this point in Isopanisad. He talks about the imperfect senses and how we cannot directly derive perfect evidence from sense perception. But for one whose senses are purified by devotional service,\natah sri-krsna-namadi \nna bhaved grahyam indriyaih \nsevonmukhe hi jihvadau \nsvayam eva sphuraty adah \n(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.234)\n\"No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of Sri Krsna through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him.\"\nSevonmukhe hi jihvadau means beginning with the tongue. By glorifying the Supreme Lord and controlling the tongue, the senses are purified. Then he can perceive Krsna with his purified senses.\nSo very powerful evidence is sabda pramana from somebody whose sense perception is clear. You can't get any more powerful pramana than that. You've got the statements of the previous acaryas, you've got the statements of scriptures, and it's being presented by somebody who is not imposing any interpretation because his senses and his understanding is clear-- transparent. And therefore this pramana is potent.\nSo Gopinath Acarya presented his pramana. He presented evidence from the scriptures in order to establish how Lord Caitanya is none other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Who has appeared in this age. Sarvabhauma's students had a hard time accepting because they are accustomed to anumana, or hypothesis. They were accustomed to drawing their conclusions simply by logic. They think that the power of their logic is the best evidence. So although they may hear statements from scripture as evidence, they think their logic is a superior basis for drawing their conclusions than what's simply descending in parampara, which basically means that they trust their intellectual capacities to be a superior criteria for establishing evidence than the statements of scriptures themselves.\nThis is one reason why Lord Caitanya listened to Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya for seven days but made no comment. This comes later in this chapter.\nWhen Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya wanted to strengthen Caitanya Mahaprabhu's renunciation vows, he said to Lord Caitanya, \"Hear Vedanta from me.\" He then spoke Vedanta for seven days continuously and Lord Caitanya sat and listened. Or it appeared that he was listening. Then when Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya asked Him, \"Seven days now I've been speaking and You've said nothing. I've been speaking Vedanta. Can you please give me some confirmation that you've understood something that I've said.\" So although he had been speaking Vedanta for seven continuous days, Lord Caitanya said, \"I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to the Vedanta. But I can't listen to you because you've clouded the Vedanta by your interpretation. Therefore I have nothing to say. You've taken that which is self-evident and clear, and you've masked it, clouding it with your interpretations. Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was so accustomed to anumana, hypothesis and logic that his presentation of Vedanta clouded the actual essence of Vedanta.\nSarvabhauma Bhattacarya was known as the reservoir of bad logic. That was his glory. He was very learned. He knew so much sastra. This is the classic example of the verse,\nbhagavad-bhakti-hinasya \njatih sastram japas tapah \napranasyeva dehasya\nmandanam loka-ranjanam\nTRANSLATION \"For a person devoid of devotional service, birth in a great family or nation, knowledge of the revealed scriptures, performance of austerities and penance, and chanting of Vedic mantras are all like ornaments on a dead body. Such ornaments simply serve the concocted pleasures of the general populace.\" (Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya 3.11.12)\nWhat is the value of knowing so much sastra if the conclusion of the sastra is not accepted or understood? It's considered to be just like an ornament on a dead body. What is the value of an ornament on a dead body. There's no value. It's not serving any function. The body is dead. What function is an ornament on a dead body serving?\nI remember, I think I might have spoken about this once before here, many years ago there was a newspaper article in America about a gangster who was killed. This gangster had the wish that when he died he wanted his hands to be filled with hundred dollar bills. So he was killed. And when they put him in his coffin they filled his hands with hundred dollar bills and buried him. Is he going to spend them in his grave? What is the value of his ornamental hundred dollar bills?\nSo sastra says, for a person who is devoid of devotional service even if he knows so many slokas, they are like ornaments on a dead body. So Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was a reservoir of bad logic and his conclusions were imperfect. He's also teaching his students to follow the same process that if they want to understand the absolute truth by logic and by reasoning and by their intellectual efforts to hear sastra and draw these logical conclusions they will gradually, in due course of time, realize the absolute truth (even though the scriptures says to the contrary).\nThe same scriptures which they used as their evidence says,\nacintya khalu ye bhava \nna tams tarkena yojayet \nprakitibhyah param yattu \ntad-acintyasya laksanam\n\"One should not try to understand by logic that which is inconceivable. That object which is beyond material nature is called inconceivable.\" (Mahabharata, Bhisma Parva, 5.12)\nMaharabhata says that anything which is inconceivable, don't apply your logic to it because you won't be able to understand. Basically it says that you cannot understand that which is inconceivable simply by logic. Something is understood to be inconceivable when it's transcendental to material nature.\nThis verse clearly states that logic is not going to bring you to the realization of that which cannot be conceived with the mind and the intelligence. Vaisnavas know that the understanding of that which is inconceivable can only be conceived by the mercy of the same inconceivable potency. That's the only way by which one can conceive that which is inconceivable.\nVaisnavas have this faith.\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya- \nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi \njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno \nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nTRANSLATION My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years.(SB 10.14.29)\nWithout mercy one cannot realize the absolute truth in his full feature as Bhagavan.\nvadanti tat tattva-vidas \ntattvam yaj jnanam advayam \nbrahmeti paramatmeti \nbhagavan iti sabdyate\nTRANSLATION Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramatma or Bhagavan.(SB 1.2.11)\nDevotees know that the absolute truth has three features, brahman, paramatma and bhagavan. So personality means person. One can never understand the greatness of the personality of Krsna, which means a person. One can never know the Bhagavan feature unless he gets His mercy.\nTherefore the impersonalists who are accustomed to logic and argument can never approach the Supreme Lord in his personal feature, because they are more dependent upon logic and argument than they are dependent upon sabda brahma. Whenever they read scripture they impose their own conclusions on the scripture. They take a statement from scripture and they say, \"This means this.\" But it doesn't mean that. It means what it says. Those who are faithful accept it on the strength of what it says.\nTherefore those who are more dependent upon sabda brahma, those who are faithful, who accept the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who accept all statements, or evidence from the scriptures, as a means for approaching Him and serving Him, they can approach the Supreme because they are not envious of Krsna.Isn't that what Krsna says?\nidam tu te guhyatamam \npravaksyamy anasuyave \njnanam vijnana-sahitam \nyaj jnatva moksyase 'subhat\nTRANSLATION The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence. (Bg 9.1)\nNow who's imparting it? It's sabda. When Krsna says, \"I will impart this wisdom to you.\" Krsna is speaking. It's sabda. It's sabda brahma. So Krsna is saying, \"Because you are not envious, I shall impart. I shall speak to you. And you will be relieved of all miseries of material existence.\" And at the end of Bhagavad-gita Krsna says, \"This Bhagavad-gita should not be spoken to or heard by those who are envious. They will not be able to understand.\"\nFor instance\u2026 In the Tattva Sandarbha, Jiva Goswami in the beginning of his Sandarbhas, when he introduces the Sandarbhas, says, \"For those of you who are not inclined to accept the position of the Supreme Lord and to serve Him, please don't read this book.\" He states this right in the very beginning. \"If you're not inclined to accept the position of the Lord and you're not inclined to serve Him, don't enter. Don't even come in.\" Why does he say that? He says that because as we know, Jiva Goswami is the greatest Vaisnava logician. His Sandarbhas are such profound logic, that if somebody wants to argue with him, they'll never win. It's impossible. His logic cannot be defeated. And he establishes in the Sandarbhas with such logic, the supremacy of the Supreme Lord, taking all statements, especially Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the emperor of all evidence. He established the position of the Lord with such strong logic. Therefore he says, \"If you're not willing to accept that Krsna is God and you want to serve Him, then don't try to come into this book and try to understand what I am about to say.\nWhy? Because if they are envious of Krsna, and they are so attached to logic, they'll feel so frustrated, so pressed, so pushed down by Jiva Goswami's logic, that the only thing they'll do is blaspheme the Lord. So Jiva Goswami says, Please don't read this book. You'll be worse off. Better to stay away.\nWhy? Because the impersonalists are so attached to logic and argument. They have their own conclusions because they trust their intellectual prowess and abilities to understand the Absolute more than the evidence that is coming down through disciplic succession and which is clear by itself. But don't change it. Don't interpret.\nThat's why Lord Caitanya said, \"The Vedanta is very good but your interpretation is trash.\" Of course he didn't say it that way. He was always respectful to Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya. He even referred to Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya as his spiritual master. But for those who knew what He is saying, they knew He was saying that his interpretations were trash.\nSo here, Gopinath Acarya is presenting his evidence. He's saying, \"There is an incarnation in every age. Such an incarnation is called yuga-avatara. But your heart has become so hardened by logic and argument that you cannot consider these facts.\" And then there is this verse from Srimad Bhagavatam. He says, \"Now I'll give you my evidence. Here's the evidence from Srimad Bhagavatam, the emperor of all evidence.\" Then he quotes this verse. Gargamuni is speaking to Nanda Maharaja. \"Your son has appeared in different colors in previous ages.\"\nOf course, the reason why Gopinath Acarya had to refer to this verse was because Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya previously told Gopinath Acarya, \"Don't you know that the Supreme Lord is known as Triyuga? It says right in scriptures that He is Triyuga. He only appears in three ages. Therefore what is the value of your evidence? He was taking scripture and was drawing his own conclusion. \"There is no incarnation in kali yuga.\"\nAnd Gopinath Acarya is saying, \"No. No, No. Look what Bhagavatam says. He's referred to as Triyuga because there are only three lila-avataras. But in this age, the Lord appears not as a lila-avatara, but as a yuga-avatara. Look at this evidence!\" But Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya doesn't like this. And especially his students didn't like it, because the students are seeing, right in front of their teacher, that he is being defeated. So what does a person do under such circumstances? He argues.\ntarko 'pratisthah srutayo vibhinna \nnasav rsir yasya matam na bhinnam \ndharmasya tattvam nihitam guhayam \nmahajano yena gatah sa panthah\nTRANSLATION \"Dry arguments are inconclusive. A great personality whose opinion does not differ from others is not considered a great sage. Simply by studying the Vedas, which are variegated, one cannot come to the right path by which religious principles are understood. The solid truth of religious principles is hidden in the heart of an unadulterated, self-realized person. Consequently, as the sastras confirm, one should accept whatever progressive path the mahajanas advocate.\" (Mahabharata, Vana-parva, 313.117)\nIn other words, one muni he is known as a muni because his argument is better than the other munis. But dry arguments are inconclusive. tarko pratisthah srutayo vibhinna... Why? Because different munis have their different arguments and they want to be known as a muni. So to be known as a muni it means that they have to have a better argument than somebody else has. If I have to accept somebody else's argument then how will I be known as a great muni?\nTherefore as soon as they hear something that they might have to surrender to, they think, \"No. I have to argue. I'll lose my muni status.\" Isn't it? \"How can I risk losing my muni status?\" Such an embarassment. All will be lost. \"My years of cultivating this reputation as a great muni will all be lost. Therefore I must argue.\" But scriptures say that such arguments are dry and they are inconclusive. If you want to be recognized as somebody great, then follow in the footsteps of the previous acaryas. Accept their conclusion and then you will be known as someone great.\nThere is reference in the \"Prabhupada Lila\" to a well-known conversation Prabhupada had with an Indian gentleman. This man was challenging Srila Prabhupada. He was saying that \"You should not speak so harshly about others. You're supposed to be sama darsinah. You're supposed to see everyone equally.\" Prabhupada replied, \"No I simply accept Krsna's statements in Bhagavad-gita. When Krsna Himself makes such statements, avajananti mam mudha, I simply repeat what He says. But what you are speaking about, sama darsinah, that's a higher stage than I'm on. I have to make distinctions. I have to see who's following Krsna's instructions and who's not following Krsna's instructions. Therefore I make distinctions. But I tell everybody what Krsna says without discrimination. That is my sama darsinah. On that basis, I am equal to everyone.\nThen the Indian man asked, \"But what have you done? You are simply repeating what others have said. You have not done anything great. To do something great means to do something new. Prabhupada replied, \"No. I stand on my acaryas. I stand on the statements of scriptures and I am simply repeating them without interpretation. That is my qualification.\"\nPrabhupada also speaks about this in a purport to one Bhagavatam verse. This verse is quoted a little later in this chapter. The verse says:\nyac-chaktayo vadatam vadinam vai \nvivada-samvada-bhuvo bhavanti \nkurvanti caisam muhur atma-moham \ntasmai namo 'nanta-gunaya bhumne\nTRANSLATION Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead, who possesses unlimited transcendental qualities. Acting from within the cores of the hearts of all philosophers, who propagate various views, He causes them to forget their own souls while sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing among themselves. Thus He creates within this material world a situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion. I offer my obeisances unto Him.(SB 6.4.31)\nPrabhupada says in the commentary, an interesting point. He says, \"Devotees have no problem understanding the ultimate cause of everything, but nondevotees must face many opposing elements because everyone who wants to be a prominent philosopher invents his own way. In India there are many parties of philosophers, such as the dvaita-vadis, advaita-vadis, vaisesikas, mimamsakas, Mayavadis and svabhava-vadis, and each of them opposes the others. Similarly, in the Western countries there are also many philosophers with different views of creation, life, maintenance and annihilation. Thus it is undoubtedly a fact that there are countless philosophers throughout the world, each of them contradicting the others.\"\nThere's a lot to this purport. But Prabhupada explains why there are so many schools of philosophical speculation by boiling it down simply to one essential point\u2026 They are envious of Krsna. They won't accept Krsna and serve Him. They won't accept that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and they are subordinate to Him. Therefore by their logic and argument they want to draw different conclusions about the Supreme to support their elevated position. They don't want to accept the path of the mahajanas. What is the path of the mahajanas? Each of them have been recognized as great because of their ability to submit to the superior authority. And because the Lord has empowered them, they can speak with such eloquence. They can present the evidence of the scripture with such profound realization that their evidence is the most powerful form of evidence.\nTherefore the verse from the Mahabharata says that if you want to find the solid truth of religious principles where will you find it? It's not by argument. ..dharmasya tattvam nihitam guhayam/ mahajano yena gatah sa panthah(Mahabharata, Vana-parva, 313.117). You will find it in the heart of an unadulterated devotee of the Supreme Lord. All the conclusions are already there in his heart. And if you want to find them, you have to go and submit yourself to a Vaisnava who has all the conclusions within in heart.\nYou can then become the greatest scholar. Everything will be revealed. But if you don't want to submit to a Vaisnava who has all the conclusions of scriptures within his heart, you will never know. You will continue with your envious position and you will place more faith in your own logic, argument and speculation. You will never be able to approach Krsna even if you continue with this process for millions of years.\nLord Brahma establishes the same evidence in his prayers to Krsna. Those who are accustomed to logic and argument are like beating an empty husk of wheat to get grain. All they will get is their hard labor. He says that if you want to understand the absolute truth by logic and arguement, the only result you will get from all of that is hard labor.\nsreyah-srtim bhaktim udasya te vibho \nklisyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye \ntesam asau klesala eva sisyate \nnanyad yatha sthula-tusavaghatinam\nTRANSLATION My dear Lord, devotional service unto You is the best path for self-realization. If someone gives up that path and engages in the cultivation of speculative knowledge, he will simply undergo a troublesome process and will not achieve his desired result. As a person who beats an empty husk of wheat cannot get grain, one who simply speculates cannot achieve self-realization. His only gain is trouble. (SB 10.14.4)\nBut that's what they are accustomed to. And therefore they can never approach the Supreme Lord. But Lord Brahma also says that for those who hear the topics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead which is spoken by the Lord and by His pure devotees, dedicating their lives to such hearing, they will conquer the Lord although He is otherwise unconquerable by anyone in the three worlds.\njnane prayasam udapasya namanta eva \njivanti san-mukharitam bhavadiya-vartam \nsthane sthitah sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhir \nye prayaso 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyam\nTRANSLATION Those who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds. (SB 10.14.3)\nSo this is the evidence. This is the evidence of the scripture when properly understood by the intentions of the speakers themselves. But the students of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya they argued and couldn't accept this evidence. And of course we know, neither could Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya until Lord Caitanya defeated him.\nSo therefore this verse about the Lord as Triyuga and more verses will come in the future. Gopinath Acarya is now going to bring many more verses with his clear vision, his sabda pramana, his clear evidence, to establish how Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Lord. The next verse which you will begin with next week, is:\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam \nsangopangastra-parsadam \nyajnaih sankirtana-prayair \nyajanti hi su-medhasah \n(SB 11.5.32)\nThat's the next verse. Next evidence from the emperor of all evidences. Spoken from the lips of person who's realized the position of the Lord by his surrender.\nAnyways, there's more we could speak but we'll stop here. OK? Is it clear? Anyone want to ask questions? Anyone want to argue? Do you want to argue?\n(Question) May I ask a question? If I understood (?), there are no evidences that we could see by our senses. It's just that there are evidences that we should accept by faith. Like there is no evidence for (?) but anyone could see.\nWell there is evidence of those who are godly. Otherwise why are we so interested in watching every gesture and every movement of Srila Prabhupada? That's evidence. Pratyaksa. But that evidence becomes all the more profound when there's faith from having first heard. That's why Srila Prabhupada would often make the point, \"Don't accept a spiritual master simply because he has a long beard and glassy eyes.\"\nHe was speaking about so-called gurus who were popular at the time. Don't accept them simply on the basis of their appearance. Accept them first through your ears. But then after accepting them through the ears, with purified senses then one can actually see. Although they may not be able to see God with their senses they can see those who are godly. There are more references right in the verses previously.\nThe disciples of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya are asking, \"What is the proof that you received the mercy of the Lord? Then Gopinath Acarya replied, \"Knowledge of the summum bonum, the Absolute Truth, is evidence of the mercy of the Supreme Lord.(Madhya 6.89)\nPrabhupada says in the purport that Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya informed Gopinath Acarya. It's verse 89. Read it. \"Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya informed his brother-in-law, Gopinatha Acarya, 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead may not have shown mercy to me, but what is the proof of His having shown it to you? Kindly let us know about this.' In reply to this, Gopinatha Acarya said that the summum bonum, the Absolute Truth, and His different potencies are identical. Therefore one can understand the substance of the Absolute Truth by the manifestation of His different potencies. The summum bonum includes all potencies in one unit. The Absolute Truth combined with different characteristics is the original substance (vastu): parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].\"\nIt's all explained that when one has actually understood the absolute truth then his sense perception is evidence that he's contacted the absolute truth. And then Prabhupada gives an argument. The second paragraph. Read it.\nThus the Vedas state that the Absolute Truth has different potencies. When one understands the characteristics of the potencies of the Absolute Truth, one is aware of the Absolute Truth. On the material platform as well, one can understand the substance by the manifestation of its symptoms. For example, when there is heat, it is to be understood that there is fire. The heat of the fire is perceived directly. The fire may not be visible, but one can search out the fire by feeling heat. Similarly, if one can perceive the characteristics of the Absolute Truth, we can know that he has understood the substance of the Absolute Truth by the mercy of the Lord. (Madhya 6.89)\nNow understand, this is not talking about material senses. We cannot rely upon our material sense perception. That point is clear. But for one whose senses are purified, then actually, with purified senses, he can see. And that is real pratyaksa. And the other form of pratyaksa, for those whose senses are not purified, is insufficient without sabda brahma.\nPrabhupada gives an example. He says \"Just like a person may have something wrong with the engine of his car, but he knows nothing about engines. So he opens up the hood and he looks at the engine, but he can't see what's wrong. Because he has no knowledge. He said, But for a person who has full knowledge, he looks and sees the engine but he sees because he has knowledge. And he can immediately say, \"Here is your problem.\"\nSo his seeing is certainly superior to the person who has no knowledge. So Prabhupada uses that as an example to help us understand that when one has received knowledge by the descending process, then his ability to see things as they are becomes awakened. But only the knowledge which is descending through the process of devotional service, vijnana, realized knowledge.\npratyaksavagamam dharmyam \nsu-sukham kartum avyayam \n(Bg 9.2)\n\"[\u2026] because it gives direct perception of the self by realization it is the perfection of religion.\" So that is the validity of pratyaksa for those who actually have the proper ability to see and to hear with purified senses. But until the senses are purified we have to hear with faith.\nOtherwise\u2026 Prabhupada gives the example that when the transcendental sound vibration enters into the ear one has to act on it. Hearing means acting, because the absolute truth is very compelling. It forces us to do something for one who actually hears. But for one who doesn't hear with faith. It's listening. It's just a vibration that takes place in the ear. Other than that nothing else takes place. It's not actually heard. He's only listening.\nJust like sometimes when you're speaking to somebody, you can see that their arguments are already being formed while you are speaking to them. They are already defending themselves. And therefore although you are speaking to them something they need to hear, they are not hearing. They are already arguing. So they may pretend to be hearing, but they are only listening. But if it's the truth being presented to them, they are not actually hearing.\nSo there is a difference between hearing and listening. Listening is just like a little vibration (buzzzzz) in the ear. Nothing happens from it. But if one is hearing from a bona fide source, it will act. For those who have faith.So that is also pratyaksa. The ability to hear. OK?\nAll right. We will stop here. Hare Krsna.\n","nid":"4352"},{
"title":"Transcription on \"How to Make Progress in Life\", a Talk Given in Kishinev on May 15th, 2011","ref":{"target_id":"3653"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Mon, 2011-09-26 12:52","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"1","body":" The following is a partially-edited transcript of a talk given in Kishinev, Moldova on May 15th, 2011, on the topic of \"How to make progress in life.\"\nThank you for coming. I am very happy to be with all of you here in Kishinev. It\u2019s been many years since my last visit. It\u2019s nice to see so many new faces. It\u2019s also nice to see the new temple. It was under construction when I was here last time. The temple environment is certainly quite different from the first time I visited Kishinev about twenty-one years ago. I can\u2019t remember where we had the programme, though it definitely was in somebody\u2019s flat. It was in 1990, wasn\u2019t it? [Satarupa devi dasi \u2013 \"October, 1990\"]. \nSo, things have changed since then in many respects - some positive, some not so positive, but we can always look at it in a positive way if we see things properly connected to Krsna. If we see changes in a positive way but if the changes have no connection with Krsna, it only looks positive. \nKrsna explained to Lord Brahma: \"Anything you see if it has no connection with Me, you should know it\u2019s my illusory energy.\" Unfortunately, the illusory energy is not as favorable for the healthy, spiritual well-being of a living being as Krsna\u2019s spiritual energy. His spiritual energy is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. Progress in life means to make progress towards the goal of coming under the shelter of that spiritual energy. That\u2019s the definition of real progress. Any other progress which has no connection with Krsna will ultimately end in destruction. But any progress made in spiritual life is never lost. \nnehabhikrama-naso 'sti\npratyavayo na vidyate\nsv-alpam apy asya dharmasya\ntrayate mahato bhayat (BG 2.40)\n\"In this endeavor there is never any loss, nor any diminution and a little advancement on this path will protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\u201d \nSo that is real progress as defined by the Lord Himself, which may appear contradictory to the established norms that most materialistic people consider as progress. From this platform, we are hoping that all of you are making progress, real progress towards fulfilling the real purpose of life which will endure even upon giving up this temporary world - that is real progress. Human life is meant for making this progress and we should try very carefully not to forget that.\nI want to speak a little bit on that subject today in connection to chanting Hare Krsna which is a very integral part of making progress in spiritual life. In fact, it was Lord Caitanya Himself who quoted the verse, 'Harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha.'\nIn Caitanya-caritamrita it is described how Lord Caitanya accepted uncooked rice from the hands of His devotee Suklambara brahmacari and after accepting this rice He very elaborately explained the essence of chanting the holy name of the Lord by quoting this verse \u2018harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam.\u2019 This verse means : \u201cChant the holy name, chant the holy name, chant the holy name. In this age of Kali there is no other way, there is no other way, there is no other way for spiritual perfection.\u201d This verse is originally cited in Brhan-naradiya Purana, but Lord Caitanaya quoted it and elaborated on it. He said that the word \u2018eva\u2019 is used for emphasis and \u2018harer nama\u2019 is also used three times for common people to understand that there is an emphasis on these points. If we want to emphasize something, we may say something three times: \u201cStop it! Stop it! Stop it!\u201d If you want to make something emphatic, you repeat it. In the same way this verse repeats these words three times \u2018there is no other way, there is no other way, there is no other way for spiritual perfection\u2019, because spiritual progress can be made but perfection is very difficult to achieve without chanting the holy name of the Lord. Especially this emphasis is placed on \u2018in the age of Kali\u2019. \nAlso the word \u2018kevala\u2019 is used which means that no other process will work - neither the pursuit of knowledge nor austerities or penances, nor mystic yoga perfections, nor jnana. These processes cannot provide perfection, the same perfection which is achieved by chanting the holy name of the Lord. And then he quotes the verse, \nkali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara\nnama haite haya sarva-jagat-nistara\n\"In this Age of Kali, the holy name of the Lord, the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, is the incarnation of Lord Krsna. Simply by chanting the holy name, one associates with the Lord directly. Anyone who does this is certainly delivered.\n(CC Adi 17.22)\nAnyone who is hankering to establish a connection with the Supreme Lord can make a connection with Him by chanting His holy name. Lord Caitanya also continues with His instructions. He says that if you want to chant the holy name of the Lord constantly then He quotes the verse from Siksastaka,\ntrnad api su-nicena\ntaror iva sahisnuna\namanina mana-dena\nkirtaniyah sada harih (Adi 17.31)\u2028\n\"One who thinks himself lower than the grass, who is more tolerant than a tree, and who does not expect personal honor yet is always prepared to give all respect to others can very easily always chant the holy name of the Lord.\"\nThe Lord quotes this verse to help us understand that if we want to achieve perfection in chanting which is through continuous chanting, we have to cultivate the proper mentality. He gives the example of a tree. If somebody comes and breaks its branches, a tree will never complain. If a tree is drying up, it will never ask anyone for water. That is how tolerant a tree is. Many people may do something to a tree. \nI know it\u2019s very common in America - people would carve their initials on a tree. Is it common here too? \u2018Joe loves Mary forever.\u2019 But a tree doesn\u2019t complain. So many people may come and carve their initials. Lord Caitanya uses this example of a tree for tolerance. Lord Caitanya explained that one should take this verse, string it on the thread of the holy name of the Lord and wear it around one\u2019s neck for constant remembrance. In this way He gave elaborate instructions on chanting the holy name of the Lord. These are instructions which came directly from His mouth and we are simply repeating those instructions He gave for our benefit today.\nChanting Hare Krsna is such an integral part of achieving spiritual perfection and it's also a means for making the type of progress we were speaking about in the beginning. Therefore, we will speak of this topic today by studying the references of the previous acaryas. This reference is under the category of \"prayer.\" Chanting Hare Krsna is a prayer. \nSometimes when we hear about prayer we become bewildered: \u201cWhat am I supposed to pray for?\u201d Sometimes when it\u2019s very difficult we may pray for relief from distress, when we are in poverty we may pray for opulence, when our dear friend or relative has a terrible disease we may pray for his recovery. In other words, there is a tendency to pray when we are in a difficult situation. \nJust like I remember in 1974 Srila Prabhupada was very ill. He was in India and his disciples throughout the world were very concerned about his health. We wanted to pray to Krsna for Prabhupada\u2019s recovery and the devotees asked Srila Prabhupada: \u201cWe want to pray to Krsna for your recovery. How should we pray?\u201d I remember it came at a time when I was in the movement for a little over a year. I think I was initiated but I wasn\u2019t second initiated yet. To be connected with Srila Prabhupada was something everyone wanted, so obviously we wanted him to stay not only to be connected with him through initiations but also through his instructions and guidance. I remember in our temples throughout the world we began having 24-hour kirtan. That was one way by which we prayed.\nWe wanted to ask Krsna: \u201cPlease save Srila Prabhupada.\u201d And Prabhupada instructed us to pray like this: \u201cMy dear Lord Krsna, if You so desire please save Srila Prabhudapa.\u201d That was our prayer. Every day devotees prayed: \u201cMy dear Lord Krsna, if You so desire please save Srila Prabhupada.\u201d Prabhupada taught us that prayer. \nIn other words, that\u2019s how Prabhupada was thinking when he taught us this prayer. Prabhupada was thinking that he didn\u2019t want to do anything separate from Krsna\u2019s desire. He specifically asked His disciples: \u201cPray like this, don\u2019t pray that I be saved and stay here in this world. If Krsna wants me to stay, I\u2019ll stay; If Krsna wants me to go, I\u2019ll go.\u201d In other words, Prabhupada was in such transcendental consciousness that he fully understood the meaning of the verse, \nnarayana-parah sarve\nna kutascana bibhyati\nsvargapavarga-narakesv\napi tulyartha-darsinah\n(SB 6.17.28)\nwhich means that devotees of the Lord are only interested in serving Lord Krsna. Whether they are in heaven, whether they are in hell, whether they are liberated - for them it\u2019s all the same. Prabhupada is only interested in whatever Krsna wants and, therefore, He asked us to pray in that way. \nA devotee is someone who simply wants to satisfy the Lord\u2019s desire and he is only interested in the opportunity to serve Him. That is one example I can reflect on when talking about the purpose of prayer. \nI remember saying that prayer very fervently many times every day. I was praying in the way Prabhupada asked me to pray, even though I wanted to say: \u201cPrabhupada, stay with us.\u201d But I knew I couldn\u2019t do anything separate from Prabhupada\u2019s instructions and similarly all the devotees also followed Prabhupada\u2019s instructions in that respect. \nSo, when we talk about prayer we should understand what should be the proper attitude in praying because, as we said, chanting Hare Krsna is also a prayer, and therefore, there should have the proper attitude while we are chanting. \nI wanted to read (it\u2019s not long) a quote under the section of prayer in the instructions by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. He is asking the question: \u201cHow should we call the Supreme Lord?\u201d Listen carefully if you are interested in progress in the spiritual life (we hope that\u2019s why you are here). \nHe writes\u2026\n\"Sri Gaurasundara taught us that in order to chant the Lord\u2019s holy names, we must become lower than the straw in the street. Unless we consider ourselves insignificant, we cannot call upon another for help. Only when we pray for another\u2019s help do we consider ourselves helpless. In such a state of mind we think that without another\u2019s help we will be unable to do anything. We will feel it impossible to do that thing alone which is meant to be done by five people.\nSri Gaurasundara has instructed us to chant the Lord\u2019s names. We get this information from our spiritual master. To chant the Lord\u2019s names means to take His help. But while chanting, if we consider Him our servant or expect Him to do our work, then there is no question of our living in the conception, \u201cI am lower than the straw in the street.\u201d\nAn external display of humility is not necessarily genuine humility but cheating. Our call will not reach the Lord if we call Him as a master calls his servants. He is supremely independent and not under anyone\u2019s control. Unless we transform our false ego and become sincerely humble, our prayers will not reach the supreme, independent Lord.\nOne more point: We have to remember that while humbly chanting the Lord\u2019s name, if we do not become tolerant, our chanting will remain imperfect. If we display our intolerance by being greedy for particular objects, then we are opposing the principle of humility. If we have complete faith that the Supreme Lord is the Absolute Truth and by chanting His names we will not experience poverty, we will have no lack of tolerance. As soon as we become greedy and try to exhibit our impatience or our own skill, we cannot call the Supreme Lord properly.\nWe often think we are doing the Lord a favor by offering Him prayers\u2014that we could have engaged in some other activity than chanting the Lord\u2019s name. Such a mentality is an example of a lack of tolerance. We need someone to protect us from such a mentality, someone to help us become lower than the straw in the street. We certainly need to take shelter of a person who will deliver us from sinful motives. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, \u201cLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not reject those who worship Him under the shelter of the spiritual master. Others simply die uselessly.\" [End of quote]\nThere\u2019s a lot to speak about but I\u2019ll try to discuss a little bit about the proper attitude of chanting in accordance to what Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has described here. \nThe first point refers to the trinad api sunicena verse which we quoted in the beginning of the talk. It was Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura who said that this verse, [One should chant the holy name in a humble state of mind thinking himself lower than the straw in the street.] is the siddha-pranali for Gaudiya vaisnavas. Siddha-pranali is the means for achieving perfection. Siddha means perfection. If we want to achieve perfection we should really try to understand this verse. We already spoke a little bit about what perfection is; although if we talk elaborately on that topic we could certainly give a whole lecture about \u2018What is perfection?\u2019 In fact, the whole Srimad-Bhagavatam is a topic about perfection. Perfection is fully engaging in the service of the Lord with love. And all the descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord in Srimad-Bhagavatam are all narrations about those who achieved perfection. \nPerfection is not an inert state of being. It\u2019s not that upon once having achieved it, there is something else that has to come next. That\u2019s the nature of other types of perfection, or so-called perfection. Anyone who is looking for other types of perfections should know that when they are obtained, there\u2019s still something else to be had. Even liberation is described to be incomplete perfection. Why is liberation incomplete perfection? Because even if one becomes liberated from this world after performing very severe austerities and penances, he will fall from this position unless he\u2019s taken shelter of Krsna\u2019s lotus feet and has fully engaged himself in favorable devotional service to Krsna. Sometimes we may think: \u201cLiberation is a very nice word, it\u2019s very attractive.\u201d We may talk about liberation in many aspects of life. \nFor example, some people say that they have been liberated from somebody they had to live with for 25 years and who tortured them. Some call it divorce, others call it liberation, but it\u2019s incomplete liberation. By nature we need to be connected to something. If we don\u2019t establish a connection with Krsna, then whatever other connection we establish after we become liberated from that relationship, it will also in due course of time inspire us for liberation again. In other words, it doesn\u2019t fully satisfy the self. There is something higher and until we actually establish our connection with Krsna, all other forms of liberation that we may experience in this world remain incomplete.\nKrsna says in the Bhagavad-gita: \u201cOne who is not connected to the Supreme can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how could there be any happiness without peace?\u201d (Bg. 2.66) Krsna says: \u201cIf you are not connected with the Supreme, if you haven\u2019t established your connection with Him, there is no peace, because whatever you connect yourself to, cannot satisfy the hankering of the soul.\u201d Therefore, there won\u2019t be peace because there\u2019s no satisfaction. There will be constant fear of loss and a lot of anxiety, because there\u2019s no shelter in this connection. Everyone needs shelter. Our mind and our desires need to be sheltered too. Therefore, when we speak about perfection, real perfection is understood as establishing our connection with Krsna\u2014 not simply becoming liberated from suffering. Therefore, we say that liberation is incomplete unless one takes shelter in Krsna. \nThis perfectional state is not a stagnant state - upon having achieved it there\u2019s still more that has to be achieved. Volumes and volumes of books can be written, discourses and discussions can go on eternally talking about perfection, because perfection is the eternal state of affairs in the transcendental realm of the spiritual world where the eternal pastimes of the Lord are going on in the association of His eternal associates. This is perfection. Krsna is embracing Gopa Kumar, accepting him back as His eternal friend to play in the pasture grounds with the cowherd boys. Perfection means establishing our connection with Krsna \u2013 a connection that can never be lost and is never affected by the influence of time. Perfection gives ever- increasing pleasure, filled with unlimited variety and experience. The activities of the spiritual world are perfection, therefore Krsna says, \navyakto 'ksara ity uktas\ntam ahuh paramam gatim\nyam prapya na nivartante\ntad dhama paramam mama\n[BG 8.21]\nThat which the Vedantists describe as unmanifest and infallible, that which is known as the supreme destination, that place from which, having attained it, one never returns -- that is My supreme abode.\nTad dhama parama mama means \u2018My Supreme abode\u2019. That Supreme abode is unmanifested and infallible and it\u2019s a supreme destination When one goes there, he never has to come back again. That is the perfection we are speaking about. We are not speaking about any other so-called perfection upon having achieved we begin to realize: \u201cOh, no. All that work ...and now, still I need something else. I still want something else.\u201d Then we reject that and aspire for something else. People are so disturbed, as Prabhupada explains in a commentary of Bhagavad-gita, \"because of the want of an ultimate goal.\" As they don\u2019t have the ultimate goal, whatever goals they set can\u2019t satisfy the soul.\n Prabhupada would often quote the verse, \nKrsna-bhakta \u2013 niskama,ataeva \u2018santa\u2019bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kami \u2013 sakali \u2018asanta\n(\u0421\u0441. \u041cadhya 19.149)\nThe devotee of Lord Krsna is\u2018niskama\u2019- he has no material desires, therefore, he can be peaceful. There are those who are \u2018bhukti\u2019 desiring sense enjoyment, worldly enjoyment, whose who are \u2018mukti\u2019 desiring liberation, those who are \u2018siddhi\u2019 desiring mystic yoga perfections. They are all\u2018kami\u2019 which means they still have lusty desires. \u2018Sakali asanta\u2019 they can never be peaceful, because they still have so many unfulfilled desires. As long as they have unfulfilled desires they must make endeavors to get those desires fulfilled. There is no peace, because whatever one achieves doesn\u2019t satisfy the self and, therefore, we get to think: \u201cI have another desire.\u201d Krsna bhakta niskama means he is without desires, but we should understand \u2018niskama\u2019 properly. \u2018Niskama\u2019 means \u2018desireless\u2019, but real desirelessness means to desire only Krsna. Anyone who pretends to be desireless is cheating, because desire is the eternal companion of the soul and you cannot separate the two. You cannot say that \u2018life\u2019 and \u2018desire\u2019 are separate, because desire is the symptom of life. Krsna says life is always existing as well as the soul is ever existing, eternal, unborn and undying. As the soul is eternal, desire is eternal too. Then how can there be desirelessness as long as the soul is existing? The soul is always existing, eternal - no beginning, no end. It\u2019s inconceivable, because we are accustomed to thinking that everything has a beginning. We always try to trace things back to its beginning; we look for evidence about something\u2019s beginning. But Krsna has no beginning and the soul has no beginning.\n na tv evaham jatu nasam\n na tvam neme janadhipah \nna caiva na bhavisyamah \nsarve vayam atah param \n(Bg. 2.12) \n\u201cNever was there a time when I didn not exist nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.\u201d That is clear evidence. The devotee is the one who accepts the words of the Lord as evidence. It\u2019s evidence of the eternity of the soul which means \u2018no beginning and no end\u2019. \nThe desire can never be taken away from the soul, so how can the soul be desireless? We may try to obliterate our desire. That\u2019s what the impersonalists try to do. They see that all their sufferings are connected with some previous desire and think: \u201cI had so many desires which ultimately led to so much pain that it\u2019s better for me not to exist - then I can be happy or at least I won\u2019t be suffering. Thinking that happiness does not exist they define their pleasure as the absence of suffering. They say: \u201cAll my attempts for pleasure resulted in sufferings which were caused by my unfulfilled desires. Let me not exist. At least I won\u2019t have to suffer.\u201d \nWhen a devotee hears that, it\u2019s very painful for him. A devotee doesn\u2019t like such a concept - not to exist. First of all, he knows that\u2019s not possible and he thinks: \u201cIf I don\u2019t exist, how shall I serve Krsna, which is my only happiness?\u201d Therefore, to hear such a philosophy is painful for a devotee. \nSrila Prahupada used to quote the verse from Prakasananda Sarasvati, \nkaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate\ndurdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate\nvisvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate\nyat karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah\n(Caitanya-candramrta 5)\n\"For a devotee, the pleasure of merging into the existence of Brahman is considered hellish. Similarly, he considers promotion to heavenly planets just another kind of phantasmagoria. The yogis meditate for sense control, but for the devotee the senses appear like serpents with broken teeth. The whole material world appears joyful for a devotee, and even great personalities like Lord Brahma and Lord Indra are considered no better than insects. Such is the position of a devotee who has received but a small glance of the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Unto this most magnanimous personality I offer my respectful obeisances.\n \u201cTo hear the conception of liberation for him is like going to hell.\u201d Liberation is like hell if there is no Krsna. \u201cHow can I possibly even think or pray for liberation which has no connection with Krsna and service to Krsna? Krsna is eternal and I\u2019m eternal, therefore, real shelter, real happiness and real permanence is establishing my relationship with Krsna.\u201d That\u2019s what we are praying for when we\u2019re chanting Hare Krsna. \u201cKrsna, please engage me in Your service.\u201d We are not praying, \u201cKrsna, please remove my suffering.\u201d \nWhen we chant Hare Krsna we pray: \u201cKrsna, engage me in Your service.\u201d To have an opportunity to serve for a devotee is the answer to his prayer. When the opportunity comes, we may not be able to recognize how Krsna gives it to us if we are not careful and if we have mixed motives. We may think while praying to Krsna: \u201cKrsna, give me this service that I like.\u201d That\u2019s what Srila Bhaktisiddhanta is saying here. To chant the Lord\u2019s name means to take His help but His help for what? If we consider Him our servant or expect Him to do our work, then there\u2019s no question of living in the conception \u2018I\u2019m lower than the straw in the street\u2019. In other words, if we are praying to Krsna \u2018please give me this\u2019, we are actually asking Krsna to become our servant. \nSometimes we say: \u201cI want this so that I can use it for You. I can\u2019t serve You unless I have this.\u201d Which are we more interested in? Are we more interested in serving or in getting what we want so that I can use it for Krsna's service sometimes and call it \u2018mine\u2019? We shouldn\u2019t make Krsna our servant; we pray to Krsna to be His servants. We should be praying for the service and then whatever help we need to do that service, we pray to Krsna: \u201cPlease help me so that I can do this service.\u201d By giving us His help He is deciding what we need to do for service. We do not set the condition: \u201cIf I have this, I\u2019ll serve.\u201d Service is first and foremost that\u2019s why we must think like that: \u201cPlease give me a service. Let that come down. Give me something to do for You. You give it to me. I don\u2019t want to concoct, I don\u2019t want to do something for myself and call it \u2018for You\u2019. That\u2019s not a servant.\nPrabhupada once said while talking about being a servant when a spiritual master asks for some water and the disciple says: \u201cSrila Prabhupada, there\u2019s some nice milk; milk is much better than water.\u201d The spiritual master replies: \u201cNo, I asked for water. Why are you bringing me milk? You\u2019re my servant. Bring what I ask for.\u201d Krsna says, \npatram puspam phalam toyam\nyo me bhaktya prayacchati\ntad aham bhakty-upahrtam\nasmani prayatatmanah \n(Bg 9.26) \n\u201cIf you offer me a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water with love and devotion I\u2019ll all accept.\u201d\nDoes He want the leaf, the fruit, the flower or the water? They are all His anyway. We may offer Him a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water but what makes Him inclined to accept it? It\u2019s not because it\u2019s a leaf. Imagine that we go out, pull off a leaf from the tree, throw it on the altar and say: \u201cOK, Krsna, You asked for a leaf, there it is. Now, where is my reward?\u201d Unfortunately, sometimes people do like that - they come in, take darsan of the Deity, drop a little donation in the box and go home waiting to see how it will be turned into a palace. But that\u2019s not service, it\u2019s mixed service. Some mixed motives are there. We should always be hankering for an opportunity to serve. The service is so dynamic, so unlimited because Krsna is a person and He has desires. \nIf we talk about service, there has to be a person involved. We can\u2019t serve an inert object. To serve a person means to serve his desires. That\u2019s service. Krsna becomes so pleased by service rendered to Him without any material motivation that He wants to give something in return. It\u2019s natural, isn\u2019t it? He is thinking: \u201cMy devotee is offering this to Me with love, he is not asking for anything.\u201d Krsna says to His devotee: \u201cPlease let me give you something.\u201d The devotee keeps on saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d Krsna says: \u201cLet me give you a benediction.\u201d The devotee says: \u201cPlease let me be Your servant and You\u2019ll be my master birth after birth.\u201d Krsna says: \u201cI can make you a king, I can give you a kingdom, I\u2019ll give you a planet - anything you want.\u201d But the devotee keeps on saying: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want anything. I just want to serve You, I don\u2019t want anything else.\u201d \nImagine how Krsna feels. He is a person, He feels so obliged to him. He thinks: \u201cI have to give him something, even though he is not asking for anything.\u201d What does Krsna give? Most valuable. He gives him His heart and He places it in the heart of His devotee. Krsna says: \u201cThe devotee is always in My heart and I am always in the heart of my devotee. The devotee doesn\u2019t know anything but Me and I don\u2019t know anyone but him.\u201d That\u2019s how Krsna thinks about his devotee. Was it the leaf that did that? No, not a leaf, a fruit, a flower or water. It\u2019s devotion. What is devotion? It\u2019s favorable, it means with the intention to please Krsna. That is devotion. I want to please Him and even if it appears impossible, even if it appears that I can\u2019t do it myself. It\u2019s good to feel helpless. A devotee should feel helpless, not hopeless. Helpless but we always have hope. When he feels helpless it helps him to remember Krsna. \nTherefore, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati is saying, \u201cUnless we consider ourselves insignificant, we cannot call upon another for help.\u201d One may think: \u201cI can do it. I have an ability to do anything Krsna wants me to do. I don\u2019t need Krsna to do it, I just need Him to tell me what to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d And we think we are doing it. Krsna says, \nprakrteh kriyamanami\n gunaih karmani sarvasah\n ahankara-vimudhatma\n kartaham iti manyate \n(Bg 3.27)\n \u201cThe spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature.\u201d \nBut the devotee never thinks that he\u2019s doing. He knows that he\u2019s simply serving and if anything manifests by his service, it\u2019s because of the desire of a person who gave the instruction to do it. He\u2019s simply the instrument. His spiritual master wants it. That\u2019s why Srila Bhaktisiddhanta ends in saying that we need someone to protect us from such a mentality, someone to help us become lower than the straw in the street. We need to take shelter of a person who will deliver us from sinful motives. Srila Narottama das Thakura says, \u201cLord Krsna does not reject the one who worships Him under the shelter of the spiritual master, others simply die uselessly.\u201d That happens because they think: \u201cI\u2019m the doer.\u201d They don\u2019t have any superior order. They don\u2019t have any service except their own mental concoctions. They simply serve their own mental concoctions which have no connection with Krsna. \nTherefore, we need to take shelter to get a protection of someone who helps us to eradicate these motives, so that we can chant Hare Krsna in the proper state of mind thinking ourselves helpless and dependent, like a child crying for his mother. Prabhupada says that\u2019s how we should chant, like a child. A child doesn\u2019t know anyone except his mother. He gets nourishment from of his mother\u2019s breast and thinks: \u201cNow I have a shelter.\u201d This is the state of mind that enables us to feel some connection with Krsna. By cultivating this state of mind while chanting Hare Krsna we may progress along the path of devotional service towards perfection, not towards an unfulfilled destiny. A devotee always feels hopeful to attain that perfection. Therefore, he goes on chanting and endeavoring with confidence. \nIn this age of Kali there is no other way, there is no other way, there is no other way for perfection. The holy name of the Lord delivers this perfection when chanting in the proper state of mind. Is that OK? Anybody disagree? Anybody needs clarification of anything we said?\nQuestion: If we feel self-sufficient and we do not need God to fulfill our desires, how do we pray in such state of mind? \nAnswer: Do you want to know? Then you must have some need for God otherwise you wouldn\u2019t ask the question. So, you are already on the right path. If you think you are self-sufficient and you don\u2019t need God, you should analyze if anything you have right now is giving you full satisfaction. If it is, then you don\u2019t have to do anything. Just be satisfied. But unfortunately, unwanted things come of their own accord. There is a verse in Srimad-Bhagavatam which states, \n\u201cPersons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down to the lowest planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.\u201d(SB 1.5.18) The point is that inconveniences and unwanted events in our life come without asking. We don\u2019t endeavor for them. We try to avoid them but they come. Look around and you\u2019ll see it happens. There is another verse, \nahany ahani bhutani\ngacchantiha yamalayam\nsesah sthavaram icchanti\nkim ascaryam atah param\n\"Day after day countless living entities in this world go to the kingdom of death. Still, those who remain aspire for a permanent situation here. What could be more amazing than this?\" (Mahabharata (Vana-parva 313.116))\nIt\u2019s the most amazing thing. We see it happen every day. All species of life, human beings are dying, living, becoming old, diseased and those who remain think: \u201cWell, I avoided it.\u201d But it comes of its own accord. Just as distress comes of its own accord, happiness comes also of its own accord and an intelligent person endeavors for neither. Those who endeavor for happiness separate from Krsna according to the laws of karma are creating all the conditions for future distress. You don\u2019t see it because you think you are happy now. But why does distress come of its own accord? There are laws of the universe behind it. You\u2019re thinking: \u201cI\u2019m enjoying now.\u201d You can\u2019t see that the seeds of the future suffering have been planted. To break free from that cycle you need to depend on Krsna. There is no other way. You may think: \u201cNow I\u2019ll enjoy.\u201d Just like a child. A young child thinks: \u201cI\u2019ll play.\u201d Parents say: \u201cGo to school.\u201d The child says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to school. I want to play; I want to be happy now. I don\u2019t like school.\u201d When the child grows up, he regrets that he didn\u2019t go to school, but as a child he was happy playing. You have a future also and that future is as a soul. You have to think of the future, not just how much you can enjoy now. Those who understand the laws of nature and the purpose behind this world are intelligent - they think of the future. If you try to forget Krsna and simply become happy separate from Him, you should think of the future that will come - then you\u2019ll want to call out and pray. That is the word of encouragement. Think now before it\u2019s too late and before you have to ask yourself: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I do it?\u201d \nQuestion: What shall we do if Krsna sometimes gives us service and engaging in this service we obtain a sense of value, a sense of worth that makes us proud? How shall we avoid that always remaining humble and despite that engaging in devotional service? \nAnswer: Everyone needs a sense of self-worth. There\u2019s nothing wrong in having it. We need to feel wanted. Krsna wants everyone of us. Krsna has a connection with everyone of us. Krsna wants everyone of us to serve Him to be happy. If we are conscious of our identity as servants of Krsna, then we\u2019ll feel that sense of self-worth, but if we forget that we are subordinate to Krsna and take credit for our activities, then we\u2019ll lose connection with our devotional service. Therefore, in order to protect ourselves from that consciousness we have to follow Krsna\u2019s words in Bhagavad-gita. \u201cIn all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.\u201d(Bg.18.57) If you become conscious of Me, you\u2019ll pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.\u201d(Bg.18.58) That\u2019s our only protection. Our protection is to be always subordinate to Krsna otherwise we will think that we're the doer. We will try to take credit for ourselves. We will lose our connection because Krsna says: \u201cIf you act by proper understanding, you\u2019ll cross over obstacles by My grace, but if you act through false ego not hearing Me, you will be lost.\u201d It is simply the question of consciousness, the consciousness one must have through all his endeavors. \u201cI am a servant; I am doing this for Krsna\u2019s pleasure. I\u2019m doing it under His order, His instruction and because He wants it I\u2019m confident that I will have to continue to do it. I\u2019ll be able to continue to serve Him.\u201d That will prevent us from becoming proud. \nPride is so dangerous. Pride is a cause of so many sufferings and inconveniences. Pride means \u2018disconnected from Krsna\u2019; it means \u2018I\u2019m forgetting that I\u2019m a servant\u2019. Self-esteem, as we said it before, is not pride, self -worth is not pride in the sense \u2018I\u2019m so important\u2019. Self-worth means \u2018even though I\u2019m so insignificant, even though I\u2019m a wretch, even though I have neither love for Krsna nor qualifications - we can think of all our disqualifications - somehow by the mercy of Lord Caitanya and His devotees, I\u2019ve been given the opportunity to serve Him.\u2019 That gives us a sense of self-worth.\n Question: We\u2019ve been talking about being tolerant like a tree. A tree can be broken, violated out of sheer whim, craziness or madness but it will never object or complain. And we are supposed to be more tolerant than a tree. Is there any limit? What\u2019s the limit of our tolerance?\n Answer: Tolerance means not asking for anything. In Caitanya-caritamrita Lord Caitanya says: \u201cThe devotee engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord should practise forbearance like that of a tree. Even if rebuked or chastised, he should never say anything to the others to retaliate. Even if one cuts a tree, it never protests, even if it is dying or drying, it does not ask anyone for water.\u201d There is more but I want to quote another verse. It\u2019s the verse from the first Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, \ntiraskrta vipralabdhah\nsaptah ksipta hata api\nnasya tat pratikurvanti\ntad-bhakah prabhavo \u2019 pi hi\n(SB 1.18.48)\n \u201cThe devotees of the Lord are so forbearing that even though they are defamed, cheated, cursed, disturbed, neglected or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves.\u201d That is a characteristic of a devotee. Never, under no circumstances they do that. Why? Because they think: \u201cThis is coming to me due to my past activities.\u201d Just like the personality of Kali beat the bull who is the religiosity personified. When Maharaja Pariksit came in protection of dharma the bull and saw three of his legs broken, he asked: \u201cWho is the perpetrator? Who did this to you?\u201d Dharma said: \u201cIf I point out the perpetrator, I\u2019m just as guilty as the person who did it, because nothing happens without the will of the Supreme Lord.\u201d \nPariksit Maharaja immediately understood: \u201cYou must be religiosity personified.\u201d As he was a king, his duty was to protect religion. On his own initiative he sought out the person who caused the suffering of dharma the bull. One who is in proper consciousness sees that nothing can happen without Krsna\u2019s will. If I\u2019m put in a difficult situation, it\u2019s due to my past misdeeds. \ntat te 'nukampam susamiksamano\nbhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam\nhrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te\njiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak\n\"One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who always offers obeisances unto You is certainly a bona fide candidate for becoming Your unalloyed devotee.'\nA devotee is thinking: \u201cActually, I deserve much more, but Krsna has reduced it to this so I can remember Him. If it were so difficult, I wouldn\u2019t be able to remember Him but I can still remember Him - Krsna is so kind.\u201d That is how the devotee thinks. \n","nid":"4284"},{

Giriraja Swami. We were together last year in Almaty and we spoke one after the other at the Sunday Feast program at the Almaty Farm. I spoke first and then Giriraja Maharaja spoke after me. Giriraja Maharaja had both lectures transcribed and personally edited both of them. I decided to post both transcriptions here. We hope that they can be translated into Russian some time in the near future.\nHare Krsna\n\nVaisnava Compassion \nA Talk by Niranjana Swami \nSeptember 5, 2010 \nSri Vrindavan Dham, Kazakhstan\n\nMuch can be said about compassion, and although we've covered many of its different facets, there is still much more that can be said, specifically in terms of our relationships with each other as practitioners of Krsna consciousness.\nThis whole theme expands from one line in The Nectar of Devotion--that one should not give unnecessary trouble to any living entity. This is a principle of Krsna consciousness that every Vaisnava should aspire to achieve because, as we say every day, vancha-kalpatarubhyas ca, krpa-sindhubhya eva ca/ patitanam pavanebhyo, vaisnavebhyo namo namah. \"We offer obeisances to the Vaisnava devotees of the Lord, who are full of compassion for the fallen, conditioned souls.\" It is a very important quality of a Vaisnava to be compassionate with others. And one of the symptoms of this compassion is that a devotee cannot tolerate seeing others suffer.\nIt is extremely important to not criticize others. Criticizing causes unnecessary disturbance, not only to those whom we are criticizing, but also to others who have to hear it. Of course, there may be some who are not disturbed--who actually relish hearing others criticized. In a letter, Srila Prabhupada compares such persons to flies, who like to go into sores. So, some may not be disturbed, but inevitably criticism of other will cause some disturbance.\nBhaktivinoda Thakura, in Sri Bhaktyaloka, talks about the necessity of controlling the tongue. He says that if a person cannot control his tongue, he will speak unnecessarily about others, and by doing so, he will cause disturbance and create enmity. That--prajalpa--is a whole topic in itself. One time I gave five lectures on prajalpa, all from Bhaktyaloka. Bhaktivinoda Thakura gives a lot of good instruction about the necessity of controlling the tongue when speaking about others, because speaking about others is actually a natural proclivity of the soul, but usually the topic is Krsna, at least for those who understand the primary purpose for utilizing the tongue.\nSo naturally, Vaisnavas and the residents of the spiritual world are always filled with topics about somebody else, but they are usually speaking about a dark blue boy who plays the flute. The gopis all get together in little groups and are also talking about this dark blue boy, giving various descriptions about His behavior and especially about the different activities He's done.\nSo it is natural to speak about somebody else, but unfortunately, if the tongue is not controlled, then immediately when we get in the association of others, we will begin speaking about somebody else and will be looking for something to say about them. And if we are not careful, or if we do not control our propensity to speak about others, eventually we may say something that may be disturbing either to the person about whom we are speaking or to somebody who has a relationship with that person, and before we know it, we are causing harm to others.\nActually, causing harm to others is equally distributed--it comes back to us. There are many sastric references about how we suffer by causing suffering to others.\nThose who are not on a platform on which they can always speak about Krsna but have a desire to always speak about Krsna may restrict themselves from speaking about others out of fear of suffering. And generally that's good. At least they are not speaking unnecessarily about others and causing disturbance to others, but the motivation of not wanting to suffer is not completely pure. When a devotee actually has awakened his spontaneous attraction to always speak about Krsna, he doesn't have to worry about speaking critically or unnecessarily about others.\nIn the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.13.2), in a discussion with Pariksit Maharaja, Sukadeva Gosvami says that paramahamsas are those who have accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of their hearts and that they are naturally inclined to always speak about Krsna in the same way as materialists are always inclined to speak about women and sex. In other words, paramahamsas--those who have accepted Krsna within the core of their heart--have a spontaneous attraction to speak about Krsna. Why? Because their minds are always absorbed in thoughts of Him. And because their minds are always absorbed in thoughts of Him, everything they see reminds them of Him. That is their vision. Therefore they are always speaking about Krsna. What are materialists always absorbed in thoughts of? It doesn't take much to trigger some discussion about mundane subjects for people whose minds are always absorbed in mundane thoughts.\nWhen I was working in construction, the people I worked with were generally attracted to these topics. Not only would they speak about them quite often, but any object that would pass by would immediately be a topic for discussion. Spontaneous. People like this don't have to practice; it is spontaneous. Why? Because their minds were always absorbed in these thoughts. As soon as they see a catalyst, immediately it comes out--spontaneous discussion about these topics.\nSo Sukadeva Gosvami uses this analogy. It is something we can relate to, though we understand that the paramahamsas' spontaneous inclination to always speak about Krsna is borne from their deep love for Krsna within the core of their hearts. Prabhupada used the example of a parent who loves his or her child: Whenever the parent sees the toy of the child, immediately the parent sees the child; whenever the parent hears the voice of the child, he or she sees the child. If the parent sees the shoes of the child, he or she sees the child. And so on. The parent immediately makes these connections because anything that is connected to the child immediately elicits thoughts of the child.\nSo, we are speaking about the necessity of controlling the tongue, to not cause disturbance to others or, simultaneously, to ourselves. This is also connected with the topic of compassion. We should always overlook the shortcomings of others and simply see the desire that is there in their hearts to do something for Krsna. And we should be willing to accept whatever offering somebody makes, no matter how small--just like Krsna, who considers whatever benedictions He gives to be very insignificant in comparison with even a very small offering from the hand of His devotee. The Lord magnifies, increases, the size of whatever may appear to be a very small offering. He magnifies it to make it very, very great.\nSince that is the Lord's nature, the Vaisnavas, who are representatives of the Lord, are also meant to embody that compassionate nature of the Lord. Ultimately, the highest embodiment of the Lord's compassionate nature is none other than Srimati Radharani, because She pleases Krsna the most. Therefore She is very compassionate. Although doing something that could please Krsna is otherwise very difficult for us, Krsna makes Himself accessible to be pleased when we offer something to Radharani. Not only is Radharani the embodiment of this compassion, but the spiritual master, who is also in that same line, is an embodiment of compassion as well. In fact, all Vaisnavas should be compassionate by being willing to accept whatever little bit someone may offer and to utilize it for the service of Krsna.\nIn a letter dated February 4, 1972, Srila Prabhupada, covering the same theme, wrote:\n\"It is not so much that because there may be some faults in our godbrothers and godsisters, or because there may be some mismanagement or lack of cooperation, that this is due to being impersonalists--no. It is the nature of the living condition to always have some fault. Even in the spiritual world there is some fault and envy.\"\nPrabhupada appears to have been addressing a devotee who wrote to him complaining about mismanagement or lack of cooperation. He is going to explain that actually, people who think that everything is going to be utopia are the impersonalists. He says:\n\"In the spiritual world there is some fault and envy--sometimes the gopis will quarrel over Krsna's favor, and once Krsna was so much attracted to Radharani that by mistake he tried to milk the bull instead of the cow, and sometimes when the gopis used to put on their dress and makeup for seeing Krsna, they would be too hasty and smear kumkum and mascara in the wrong places and their ornaments and dresses would appear as if small children had been trying to dress themselves and they were not very expert--like that. There are so many examples. But it is not the same as material fault or material envy. It is transcendental because it is all based on Krsna. Sometimes when one gopi would serve Krsna very nicely, the others would say, 'Oh, she has done so nicely; now let me do better for pleasing Krsna.' That is envy, but it is transcendental, without malice.\"\nPrabhupada is saying here that there are faults and there is envy. Krsna is milking a bull instead of a cow, the gopis are not dressing themselves properly, and some of the gopis are competing with each other. They say, \"Oh, this gopi is doing well. I want to do better than her.\" Ordinarily we would think that there's envy, but Prabhupada is explaining that, yes, there is envy in the spiritual world, but no malice.\nStill, we should not confuse the envy in the spiritual world with our envy in the material word. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura describes lust, anger, greed, bewilderment, madness, and envy and discusses how these can be dovetailed for the service of the Lord. He says, \"Lust I will dovetail by offering the fruits of my work for Krsna's satisfaction; anger I will dovetail with the service of the Lord by becoming angry at those who are envious of Vaisnavas; greed I will dovetail by becoming greedy to hear topics of Krsna, in the association of Vaisnavas; bewilderment will be there because I will feel bewildered without achieving my worshipable Lord.\" And he will be mad--with ecstasy--while singing the glories of Krsna.\nBut he explains that envy cannot be dovetailed. We cannot be envious of somebody and use it for Krsna's service. But still, as Prabhupada is explaining here, completely purified envy exists in the spiritual world. What is the symptom of purified envy? That it is always to increase Krsna's service--without ever any malice. In contrast, when we are envious in the material world, we want to put others down. We want to either do better than others or achieve something better than them, and the way we do it is by diminishing what they are doing.\nFor instance, we might be envious of a devotee who gets a lot of respect; we might think, \"I want that respect too.\" Sitting in the middle of a group of devotees who are speaking respectfully about the devotee, about a particular service he did and how he got mercy, we might think, \"He didn't do so much; I did better than that, I did more than that. How can they be speaking about what he did when look at how much I did?\" When there is envy, the mind immediately diminishes--makes insignificant, insubstantial--what the person has done. It begins with a thought. Then it may progress to a few statements, especially if we become intolerant--\"He is getting too much glorification. Wait a minute--look.\" You may say something, examine what he has actually done. That is malice. We want to diminish somebody else's service, and by diminishing their service we try to raise ourselves up.\nIn the material world people make progress, move up, by pushing everyone else down. If I push everyone down and criticize them, then, \"Here I am! I haven't spoken about any of my faults, because they don't exist. Now you recognize who I am.\" That's envy, and it becomes very dangerous in a society of devotees because, as we explained, the devotee's mentality should be to always want to push others forward but him- or herself stay back. Gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah--to become the servant of the servant of the servant.\nGenerally, the gopis don't want to be in Krsna's personal association; they don't want to enjoy with Krsna. They get higher pleasure, millions of times higher, from taking the position of service--service to the Divine Couple--and staying in the background. But Srimati Radharani makes all sorts of different arrangements to bring the gopis forward in their connection with Krsna, and when She does that, She experiences a pleasure that is ten million times greater. She is not doing that because She is thinking, \"I want that bliss.\" No, actually She makes all these arrangements to bring others forward in their relationship with Krsna because She is so compassionate, so merciful. And in doing so, She experiences a bliss ten million times greater than being with Krsna, because Her only desire is to please Him. How could She experience so much bliss unless Krsna was pleased? It is not possible to experience so much bliss unless Krsna is pleased by that service.\nSo that is the mentality. The Vaisnava is not thinking of how to push others down and obstruct service to Krsna--because pushing others down, diminishing them, means that we are actually obstructing, getting in the way of, others' service to Krsna. Then we think, \"My service is the most important. And because my service is most important, everybody should simply assist me in my service and then everybody will be rightly situated.\" Such envy--thinking that \"I am the source of all service to Krsna. Everything is emanating from me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in my service and worship me with all their hearts.\" That is envy. We have to be very careful; the Vaisnava mentality means \"How can I increase Krsna's service?\"\nSo, in the spiritual world there is envy, but there is never any malice. No gopi is ever thinking of obstructing another gopi's service or causing harm to another gopi. That is what Prabhupada is saying here. He just presents the Absolute Truth--there is envy, but it is transcendental, without malice.\n\"So we shall not expect that anywhere there is any utopia. That is impersonalism. People should not expect that even in the Krishna Consciousness Society there will be utopia. Because devotees are persons, there will always be some lacking--but the difference is that their lacking, because they have given up everything to serve Krsna--money, jobs, reputation, wealth, big educations, everything--their lackings have become transcendental because despite everything they may do, their topmost intention is to serve Krsna. 'One who is engaged in devotional service, despite the most abominable action, is to be considered saintly because he is rightly situated.' The devotees of Krsna are the most exalted persons on this planet--better than kings, all of them--so we should always remember that and, like the bumblebee, always look for the nectar, or the best qualities, of a person. Not like the utopians, who are like flies, who always go to the open sores, or find the faults in a person, and because they cannot find any utopia, or because they cannot find anyone without faults, they want to become void, merge, nothing. They think that is utopia--to become void of personality.\"\nPrabhupada is saying here that actually utopians are impersonalists, because they think utopia means that there are no faults. Prabhupada is explaining that everywhere in creation you are going to find some fault--even in the spiritual world. Utopians think that there should be no faults (though what are they always thinking about? Other people's faults!). But Prabhupada said no, faults exist everywhere. But what is a devotee, what is a Vaisnava? A Vaisnava is one who always overlooks these faults and just simply sees the good qualities. A Vaisnava is called adosa-darsi--\"he sees no faults.\" These words are used in Caitanya-caritamrta in relation to a Vaisnava named Haridasa Pandita. He could not see others' faults. He just couldn't see them, because all he could see was the good qualities in everyone, and he would always glorify the good qualities he would see. Although faults would be there, he wasn't interested in looking at them.\nWe have to see the spark, the potential for devotional service in every living being. Everyone has it. If they don't display that potential, then as Vaisnavas, as preachers of Krsna consciousness, we should be compassionate upon them and be thinking that if they are not displaying their potential for devotional service, maybe it is because some Vaisnava hasn't been merciful to them and hasn't touched their heart. Instead of looking at their faults or looking at their material qualification, we should see their spiritual qualification. Visnujana Swami gave the example of a person who comes to the temple and has the desire to sweep the floor for Krsna. All the rest of his life may be totally abominable, but he has some desire, he wants to do something for Krsna.\nSo, a Vaisnava should always try to bring that out in others, that desire to do something for Krsna. He is not always trying to push them down by saying, \"No, everything has to be done my way.\"\nNow, of course, we know that sometimes in management there are certain decisions that must be made, and that everyone has to work in a single direction to cooperate with the authorities. But in another letter, Prabhupada talks about the duty of leaders to bring out the voluntary spirit in others:\n\"So, the future of this Krsna consciousness movement is very bright, so long as the managers remain vigilant that sixteen rounds are being chanted by everyone without fail, that they are all rising before four every morning, attending mangala-arati. Our leaders must be careful not to kill the spirit of enthusiastic service, which is individual and spontaneous and voluntary. They should try always to generate some atmosphere of fresh challenge for the devotees, so that they will agree enthusiastically to rise and meet it. That is the art of management: to draw out spontaneous loving spirit of sacrificing some energy for Krsna. But where are so many expert managers?\" (SP letter dated December 22, 1972)\nThe point, as Prabhupada is saying, is that the Vaisnava, by preaching, should awaken people's spontaneous, voluntary desire to do something for Krsna. Everybody should be encouraged to do something for Krsna. Of course, we cannot whimsically do something and say that it is in Krsna's name. But a Vaisnava is always very merciful in how he engages others and accepts whatever small offering they present, and utilizes it for Krsna's service.\nInspiration comes from hearing. It comes from Vaisnava relationships that are free from envy, free from pride, and filled with compassion. Compassion means wanting to see others advance even if they have to step on your head to go forward. That is compassion; that is Vaisnava mentality. Then inspiration is there and everybody volunteers--\"Can I do this? Can I do that?\"--because it is based on the proper platform: Vaisnava principles, freedom from envy, and a desire to see everybody engaged in Krsna's service. This is the Vaisnava way. Prabhupada talks about this in so many places. In the Seventh Canto, Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavatam there is a wonderful purport about Vaikuntha mentality.\nWe will let Prabhupada's letter conclude this discussion:\n\"So if there are sometimes slight disagreements between devotees, it is not due to impersonalism, but it is because they are persons, and such disagreements should not be taken very seriously. The devotee is always pessimistic about the material world, but he is very optimistic about the spiritual life; so in this way, you should consider that anyone engaged in Krsna's service is always the best person.\n\"I am very pleased that you are assisting your godbrothers so nicely. Yes, this is our real position, to be servants of the servants of the servants. And by your quiet and humble attitude, you shall set the example of Vaisnava so that all may learn from you, and very soon their puffed-up attitude will disappear and they will come to you and seek your advice in matters.\" (SP letter to Atreya Rsi, Bombay, February 4, 1972)\nThank you very much. Are there any questions?\nDevotee: In Srimad-Bhagavatam class today a devotee said that when a person glorifies you to your face, you should consider him your enemy and that when someone criticizes you, you should consider him to be your very good friend. But now you are saying that a devotee doesn't see the mistakes of others. So what is the correct understanding?\nNiranjana Swami: Sometimes a person may have the responsibility to find fault. Prabhupada said, \"It is my duty to find some fault.\" If somebody actually has a position that requires him to educate, train, or discipline others, he may have to point out some fault. But if the devotee who is the recipient of that criticism is sufficiently inspired in devotional service, he will want to know what his faults are--he will relish the opportunity to hear them--so he can make progress in Krsna consciousness. But if everybody thinks it is his or her duty to find fault in the same person, it can be a little hard to swallow. Of course, that person may be so humble that he is ready to accept criticism from everybody. And it is certainly to his (or her) advantage to be so genuinely humble that he see everybody as his superior and is ready to take instruction from anyone.\nBut the questions are whether it is the proper time and place to find fault in someone and whether you are the proper person to do so--in a compassionate way. If you can't do it in a compassionate way, better to hold your tongue and to look inside and ask yourself, \"Am I seeing this fault in this person because I have the same fault but don't want to recognize it in myself?\" It is very easy to find fault in those around us. What is difficult is to find it in ourselves. Generally, what disturbs us most is the same fault that we have but don't want to confront in ourselves. It is a lot easier to point it out in someone else. So, if I can't be compassionate, better to hold my tongue. If it is really something that is detrimental for that Vaisnava, I can tell it to someone who can be compassionate, and go back and look into my own heart.\nHare Krsna.\n\nVaisnava Compassion and Srila Prabhupada \nA Talk by Giriraj Swami \nSeptember 5, 2010 \nSri Vrindavan Dham, Kazakhstan\n\nHearing His Holiness Niranjana Swami's wonderful talk, I felt we were being elevated to the spiritual world. He quoted from Visnujana Maharaja. Visnujana had a program in which he went by boat along the Ganges River, in Bengal, and chanted the holy names all day, stopping at villages along the way and chanting and speaking and distributing books about Krsna. Once, when I was in Los Angeles recovering from being sick in India, Srila Prabhupada received an issue of Back to Godhead with an article by Visnujana Swami, and he remarked that Visnujana had such nice realizations because he spent so many hours every day chanting.\nWhile Niranjana Swami was speaking, I thought of an instructive incident that took place in Calcutta. The temple president there became very preoccupied in a business that he had started to raise funds for the temple, and meanwhile the temple had almost no money. Somehow, in the course of his absorption in the business, there was some neglect of the devotees in the temple. They were barely surviving. A strong-bodied devotee named Sudama Vipra, who had belonged to the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, was so famished that he would take the remnants of the ghee wicks that had been burned in the arati and squeeze out whatever little ghee was left, just to get a little more nutrition.\nThe devotees were just waiting for Srila Prabhupada to come so they could explain the situation to him and get some help. There were not very many devotees in India then, and Prabhupada allowed them to meet him quite freely. And when he came, devotees did meet with him and speak with him. Eventually Prabhupada called a meeting of all the devotees to give them a chance to express themselves. One by one, they spoke about their difficulties. At one stage Tamal Krishna Goswami, the GBC for India, protested: \"Srila Prabhupada, my only intention was to execute Your Divine Grace's will.\" And Prabhupada replied a little sarcastically, \"Is it My Divine Grace's will that the devotees should be disturbed?\"\nSrila Prabhupada listened very patiently and sympathetically to what all the devotees had to say, and he formed a committee to manage the temple. He said that they should meet every week and discuss all the programs and problems--how to do things in the best way--write their resolutions in a book, sign it, and then follow what they decided together.\nBut at a certain point Srila Prabhupada's mood seemed to change. He told the devotees, \"As long as we are in the material world, there will always be problems, but if we focus too much on the problems, we will forget our real business, which is to become Krsna conscious. Instead of thinking and talking about Krsna, we will think and talk about problems.\" Then Srila Prabhupada spoke about himself, how much he had endured to spread Krsna consciousness. He had suffered two heart attacks at sea on the way to America, and in America he had a buzzing in his ears and terrible headaches. \"I do not wish even to tell you how much I suffered. But I never complained. My principle was always, 'Everything for Krsna, nothing for me,\" and because that was my principle--everything for Krsna, nothing for me--I never had any complaint.\"\nOnce, Svarupa Damodara dasa, who later became Bhaktisvarupa Damodara Swami, told Srila Prabhupada, \"I have just one program, the Bhaktivedanta Institute, and I am always struggling with so many problems, and you are managing the whole society, the whole mission. How do you deal with all the problems?\" And Prabhupada replied, \"Problems? I don't see any problems. I only see service to my spiritual master.\" That was Prabhupada's mood, and that was his vision, and if we maintain the same spirit, we will not be inclined to find fault with other devotees or with external arrangements.\nSrila Prabhupada was expert in inspiring and accepting service from devotees and potential devotees--everyone. When he first began at 26 Second Avenue in New York City, there was a bum who heard him speak. Srila Prabhupada said, \"It doesn't matter what a person was doing before, what sinful activities. A person may not be perfect at first, but if he is engaged in service, then he will be purified.\" Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta describes:\n\"Suddenly a Bowery derelict enters, whistling and drunkenly shouting. The audience remains seated, not knowing what to make of it.\n\"Drunk: How are ya? I'll be right back. I brought another thing.\n\"Prabhupada: Don't disturb. Sit down. We are talking seriously.\n\"Drunk: I'll put it up there. In a church? All right. I'll be right back.\n\"The man is white-haired, with a short, grizzly beard and frowzy clothing. His odor reeks through the temple. But then he suddenly careens out the door and is gone. Prabhupada chuckles softly and returns immediately to his lecture.\n\" 'So it doesn't matter what a person is doing before, if he engages in Krsna consciousness--chanting Hare Krsna and Bhagavad-gita--it should be concluded that he is a saint. He is a saintly person. Api cet suduracaro. Never mind if he may have some external immoral habit due to his past association. It doesn't matter. Some way or other, one should become Krsna conscious, and then gradually he will become a saintly person as he goes on executing this process of Krsna consciousness. . . . Krsna says that in such conditions, when one has decided to stop all immoral habits and just take to this process of Krsna consciousness, if by chance he does something which is immoral in the face of society, that should not be taken account of. In the next verse Krsna says, ksipram bhavati dharmatma: because he has dovetailed himself in Krsna consciousness, it is sure that he will be saintly very soon.'\n\"Suddenly the old derelict returns, announcing his entrance: 'How are ya?' He is carrying something. He maneuvers his way through the group, straight to the back of the temple, where Prabhupada is sitting. He opens the toilet room door, puts two rolls of bathroom tissue inside, closes the door, and then turns to the sink, sits some paper towels on top of it, and puts two more rolls of bathroom tissue and some more paper towels under the sink. He then stands and turns around toward the Swami and the audience. The Swami is looking at him and asks, 'What is this?' The bum is silent now; he has done his work. Prabhupada begins to laugh, thanking his visitor, who is now moving towards the door: 'Thank you. Thank you very much.' The bum exits. 'Just see,' Prabhupada now addresses his congregation. 'It is a natural tendency to give some service. Just see, he is not in order, but he thought that, \"Here is something. Let me get some service.\" Just see how automatically it comes. This is natural.' \"\nSrila Prabhupada was also expert at utilizing, or dovetailing, different things in devotional service. Another time, someone brought a bunch of Mayavadi leaflets, some papers advertising a Mayavadi program. Srila Prabhupada was very strong against the Mayavada philosophy. He often said, \"Anyone who says that he is god, he is dog.\" So we were wondering what action Srila Prabhupada would take in protest to these Mayavadi leaflets, but he found a way to engage them in Krsna's service. At the end of the program, when the devotees were distributing prasada to the guests, he had them hand out the Mayavadi leaflets for the people to use as plates for their prasada, thus engaging even the Mayavadis in Krsna's service.\nAn interesting event took place some time later, when Srila Prabhupada was in Mayapur. He had taken prasada, and his servant had taken the plate with his remnants into the next room. Soon thereafter, Srila Prabhupada heard sounds of a conflict coming from the next room, so he asked his servant to find out what was happening. When Srila Prabhupada heard the report, he called for his two assistants, Tamal Krishna Goswami and Harikesa dasa, who had been arguing.\nIt turned out that several days earlier, Tamal Krishna had asked Prabhupada if he could eat what was left in the pots of prasada that had been prepared for Prabhupada, because he found the rice the devotees ate in Mayapur too coarse to digest. Prabhupada had approved Tamal Krishna's request, but Harikesa, his cook, had previously been instructed by Srila Prabhupada that Prabhupada's remnants should not be monopolized by his immediate staff but should be distributed to other devotees. Harikesa objected to Tamal Krishna's taking possession of all the leftovers--thus the dispute.\nAs related in Hari-sauri's Diary, \"Prabhupada called them both onto the veranda. After hearing their arguments, he managed to resolve the issue to everyone's satisfaction. . . . He gave his permission for Tamal Krishna to eat what was left in the pots, but also confirmed his desire that his prasadam be distributed. . . .\n\"Then he went on to explain that the Vaisnava attitude in dealing with one another is one of humility. He gave the example of the pilgrims that come here to Mayapur. As one man comes along the road, another tries to touch his feet. The former shies away from being so honored because he is thinking, 'I am not a Vaisnava, I am just an ordinary man. I am simply trying my best to become a Vaisnava.' On the other hand the person who is touching his feet is thinking that unless he gets the dust of a Vaisnava on his head he will not be able to advance.\n\" 'Actually,' Prabhupada said, 'this is a fact. One has to be blessed by a devotee to become a devotee. And he who is the servant of the servant of the servant--one hundred times removed--is not worse than one who directly serves the guru. If one thinks, \"Because I am direct servant, I am better than others,\" then he is not a Vaisnava. To offer one's respects to guru and not to his disciples, this is wrong. This is not Vaisnava. One has to be humble and try to serve all Vaisnavas--not some and not others.' \"\nA situation arose, I believe in New York, in which there was a lot of judging and criticizing among the devotees, and Srila Prabhupada said that we should be very careful about judging other devotees, because we never know what their actual consciousness is and we may not be able to properly assess their consciousness based on external appearances and behavior. He told a story about a brahmana and a prostitute who lived opposite each other on the same street.\nAll day the brahmana would sit before his window with his Bhagavad-gita, and across the street the prostitute would be doing her business with her customers. One day a calamity occurred and they both died. The Yamadutas and the Visnudutas came, the former to take the sinful soul to Yamaraja to be judged and punished, the latter to take the purified soul to Vaikuntha, the abode of Lord Visnu. When the Yamadutas came to take the soul of the brahmana, he protested. \"No, no. You are making a mistake. You are supposed to be coming for the prostitute. The Visnudutas are supposed to be coming for me.\" But the Yamadutas replied, \"No, we are not making a mistake. All the time you were sitting with your Bhagavad-gita, you were looking out your window at the prostitute, absorbed in her activities. So by your consciousness you are fit to be taken to hell and punished. And the prostitute, all the time she was with her customers, was glancing out the window at you and thinking, \"Oh, that pious brahmana is so fortunate. All day he is absorbed in thoughts of Krsna--'Krsna is driving Arjuna's chariot, Krsna is speaking the philosophy of the Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna'--and in this way she was constantly absorbed in Krsna's teachings and activities. By her consciousness she is fit to go back home, back to Godhead.\"\nSrila Prabhupada told this story to make the point that we should be careful about judging devotees--or anyone. We don't know what their consciousness is. And if we become absorbed in their faults, real or imagined, our consciousness becomes faulty.\nOn separate occasions, when asked what the devotees should do about quarrelling in temples, Srila Prabhupada gave different but complementary answers. In one instance he said that if each devotee considers that he is a servant of the servants, there will be no fighting. In another case he said that the way to overcome dissention and dissatisfaction and fractions, to become united, was for the devotees to engage together in common activities. And as devotees, our main common activities are chanting and hearing about Krsna, engaging in kirtana, and taking prasada.\nIn relation to both accepting service from a person and not causing distress to any living entity, there was an incident in Indore, in the state of Madhya Pradesh in Central India. Srila Prabhupada was invited with some disciples to have lunch at the home of a relative of the royal family. There, we were served lunch in a beautiful room with chandeliers and a carved wood banquet table. Srila Prabhupada sat at the head of the table, and I was to his right. I felt very nervous, because the hosts served a really opulent feast, and I was trying to be very controlled, partly because I was afraid of getting diarrhea (something we were all prone to) and partly because I didn't want Srila Prabhupada to think that I was a sense enjoyer. The prasada was really good but really rich, drenched in ghee.\nI got through the meal, but then the host's elderly father came around the table with second helpings of rasagullas. All the other devotees took seconds, but I refused. I was a brahmacari, and I was being staunch--and showing Srila Prabhupada. But the gentleman really wanted me to take. He repeatedly tried to give me one more, and each time I staunchly refused. Prabhupada saw that the host's father was becoming disappointed. Finally Srila Prabhupada glanced at me, and with great love and compassion in his eyes and voice, he said, \"You can take a sweet to make an old man happy.\" And so I accepted another sweet. Srila Prabhupada wanted the old man to be happy, though later one devotee commented that by taking the sweet I had also made another old man happy--Srila Prabhupada.\nIt was really instructive to be with Srila Prabhupada and see how he, the world acarya and at the same time a spontaneous devotee, responded in different situations.\nHow Krsna, or a devotee of Krsna, can magnify the service of an aspiring devotee, can be seen in an incident that took place in Bombay. At the time, Srila Prabhupada was still struggling to get the Juhu land, and one morning he was sitting in his room discussing with his leading managers and even some guests how to solve this problem. Suddenly a very rough-looking man appeared at the door. He had a dark complexion and a muscular, sinewy build and was wearing only a simple white cloth around his waist. He was obviously a laborer. As we looked on, he walked into the room, came right up to Prabhupada's desk--Prabhupada always sat on a cushion behind a low desk--and placed on the table a bunch of flowers that he had collected from somewhere. Then he bowed down, got up, and walked out.\nSrila Prabhupada was so moved that he could not speak. For some moments he just looked down, and when finally he did speak, his voice was choked up. He said, \"Just see this man; how did he even know I was here? Somehow he heard that there was a saintly person in the house, and he went and collected some flowers, the best he could, and came and presented them as an offering. I am so much moved.\" Then he said, \"In the Bhagavad-gita Krsna says, patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati, that if one offers Him even a leaf or a flower with devotion, He will accept it. Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is moved even by a simple offering of a flower or a leaf, and I am just an insignificant living entity, so how much more I will feel moved.\" So, that is Krsna's nature, and that is Srila Prabhupada's nature, to take the smallest service and magnify it.\nSrila Prabhupada mentioned different categories of devotees. He said that in the lowest category one will find a slight discrepancy in someone's behavior and make a big thing out of it, in the next category one will see both the good and the bad but give more emphasis to the bad, and in the next category one will see both the good and the bad give equal consideration to both; the more advanced devotee will see both the good and the bad but give more importance to the good, and the highest devotee will see someone do a little service and make a big thing out of it.\nOf course, we cannot artificially imitate someone on a higher platform, but by associating with more advanced devotees, we can learn from them how devotees think and feel, and also see practically how they behave--learn from them how to see the good rather than the defects in others and how to appreciate others' service and not demand anything for ourselves.\nOne example that comes to mind is His Holiness Niranjana Swami, but I am really torn, because if I use him as an example, he may feel distress, but at the same time, it will be very informative and purifying for us. Because his mood is always to encourage other devotees, he might be willing to tolerate that discomfort, but at the same time, I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable. Anyway, I already have, so I better just finish it up quickly.\nI had the opportunity to host Maharaja in California and, with a team of devotees, serve him. Being naturally inspired by his presence, we all really wanted to give him the best we could, but once, it came out that we hadn't provided him something that he could have used, because we didn't know that he needed it. Two or three things came up like that, and I asked him, \"Maharaja, why didn't you say anything? Weren't you disturbed by our lacking?\" And he replied, \"I don't feel I deserve anything. That's why I don't ask, and that's why I'm not disturbed.\" That is a Vaisnava.\nAssociation. I gain so much from the association of my godbrothers, who are so exemplary in so many ways. We shouldn't think that we can learn only from our guru. We can learn from any devotee who is exemplary in any way. Part of being a servant of the servants is that you learn from the servants you serve--from their examples, their behavior, even small comments they make. They don't have give a discourse or a class. You can learn from just a few words or a small action or gesture.\nIt is very purifying, because we come into the material world out of envy of Krsna, and that envy can be very deep-rooted and ongoing for countless lifetimes, but by serving and appreciating devotees and learning from them, from their exemplary behavior and words, we can become purified of that longstanding envy. Glorifying devotees is extremely purifying. In a way, it is easier to glorify Krsna--or Srila Prabhupada or our personal spiritual master--because He is in a different category, but to glorify our godbrothers and godsisters is very purifying, because we can see ourselves as being in the same category, so in a way it is easier for us to fall into bad ways of thinking--being envious and jealous and competing and wanting what they have and wishing we had it, and so on.\nThe association of my godbrothers has been extremely nourishing and encouraging and purifying for me ever since Srila Prabhupada's departure. In an exchange I had with Tamal Krishna Goswami in Dallas, he confided in me that even with all his association with Srila Prabhupada and all three initiations--hari-nama, Gayatri, and sannyasa--he still didn't feel that his relationship with Srila Prabhupada alone was enough to sustain him in his spiritual life. He said that he also felt the need for siksa-gurus, godbrothers whose instructions he took very seriously. And he named a number whom he considered to be his siksa-gurus--Sivarama Swami, Bhurijana Prabhu, and others. At that time my mood was different, because I had put a lot of faith in some godbrothers who had fallen down and left the association of devotees, and after those incidents I practically vowed, \"I am never going to put my faith in anyone again--except Srila Prabhupada.\"\nSo I heard what Tamal Krishna Goswami said, and I took it seriously, but it went against my resolution. The next morning, we went for the morning program, and after mangala-arati Goswami Maharaja and all the devotees chanted japa in the temple. The japa was very intense, and there were many nice paintings of krsna-lila on the walls. I was chanting and chanting, going deeper and deeper, when this thought just overpowered my mind--that what Goswami Maharaja had said was true: we can't do it on our own. I realized, \"I can't do it on my own, just on the basis of my relationship with Srila Prabhupada. I do need siksa-gurus in my life.\" And it came to me almost equally clearly that Goswami Maharaja was meant to be my siksa-guru, or at least one of them. I didn't want to disturb him during his japa, but I felt that I just had to tell him. So I turned to him and said, \"I thought about what you said, and I believe it is true. I also need guidance, and I think you are meant to be my siksa-guru.\" He gave a knowing glance and a little smile, and we continued with our chanting.\nThe night before, I had told Goswami Maharaja that I felt very isolated, because at that time some of the biggest leaders in the movement had left, and there was chaos in large geographical areas of the movement. I was trying to deal with things in Mauritius and South Africa, and I wanted godbrothers to come there, but they were dealing with similar crises in other places--England, most of Europe, Australia, and parts of America. So I told Goswami Maharaja, \"I really feel isolated in Mauritius and South Africa. No one can come there. I don't know what to do for association.\" He said, \"You have to go out of your way to get it.\" So if it has to be Kazakhstan, I will come to Kazakhstan--or Ukraine, or wherever. You all are really blessed, because Krsna sends senior devotees to visit you.\nAlthough in general we don't want to find faults in devotees, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura says that sometimes in order to protect a dependent devotee from bad association, we have point out the faults of another person. In other words, because the association and service of devotees is so important, we have to be able to distinguish between who is a devotee and who is not. Someone might be regarded as a devotee in popular circles who may actually not be a devotee. He could be a Mayavadi or a pretender or an atheist, and to protect innocent people from such association, we might have to point out who is actually a devotee and who is not. Bhaktivinoda Thakura says that if any person argues that criticizing such nondevotees is an offense, that person's association should also be avoided.\nOne of Srila Prabhupada's friends in Bombay, Dr. Patel, had been born in a Vaisnava family and followed Vaisnava principles of purity, but he often talked like an impersonalist, and when Prabhupada would accuse him of being a Mayavadi, he would beg to differ: \"No, Sir. I am a Vaisnava.\"\nOne day, on a morning walk on Juhu Beach, Srila Prabhupada happened to criticize a famous Indian religious figure whom Dr. Patel revered, and Dr. Patel became very upset. \"You cannot criticize like this!\" he said. But Srila Prabhupada replied, \"I am not saying. Krsna is saying: na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah--anyone who does not surrender to Krsna is a fool, rascal, demon, the lowest of mankind. I am not saying; Krsna is saying.\"\nStill, Dr. Patel kept insisting, \"You cannot criticize like that!\" The argument escalated to the point where Dr. Patel was shouting at Srila Prabhupada and Srila Prabhupada was actually shouting back. Dr. Patel was a leader among his friends--he was a little intelligent, educated in England, a doctor--but even his friends were catching hold of his arm and saying, \"Swamiji has a heart condition. Don't upset him.\" They tried to drag him away. He was shouting, and Prabhupada was shouting, and we all were very disturbed. Finally they pulled Dr. Patel away.\nBack in Srila Prabhupada's room, Tamal Krishna Goswami asked Prabhupada, \"Why do you tolerate him? What is his actual position? Is he a Vaisnava? Is he a Mayavadi? What is he?\" In response, Srila Prabhupada told a story about a man who could speak fluently in many languages. He came to a place, but nobody could figure out where he was actually from. In whatever language people addressed him, he immediately responded perfectly in that anguage. So it was a big topic among the village people--where he was from. Finally one man said, \"I will find out.\"\nOne day that man snuck up behind the speaker of many languages and gave him a very hard whack, and then the linguist began cursing in his original language. Srila Prabhupada said that Dr. Patel was like that. \"He can speak like a Vaisnava, he can speak like a Mayavadi, he can speak like a nationalist,\" Srila Prabhupada said. \"He can speak many different languages expertly. But when I hit him where it really hurt, his real language came out.\" So then Tamal Krishna Goswami asked, \"Well, then why do you tolerate him?\" And Srila Prabhupada replied, \"It is our duty to engage everyone.\" That is real compassion.\nOf course, Srila Prabhupada accomplished many things in what he did. He also created a lot of interesting discussions for us to hear. And I think he actually liked Dr. Patel, and Dr. Patel actually liked and respected him, but they just had that relationship.\nThe next story also involves Dr. Patel and shows how Prabhupada appreciated his disciples and protected them. When Dr. Patel first heard about the devotees, we had just come to the Juhu land and were living in very simple tents. It became so hot that devotees often just slept outdoors, and they were getting bit by mosquitoes, and some got malaria, jaundice--so many diseases. Dr. Patel was really impressed by their sacrifice and surrender, so he took up a collection to give each devotee a thin mattress, a pillow, a mosquito net, and a blanket for the winter. He was a proud man, but he went to the big cloth market in Bombay, from stall to stall, to beg, and eventually he presented twelve sets, for all the devotees.\nIf you've ever lived in an ashram, you know how it is. After a while, one blanket went missing, then two pillows disappeared, and gradually the hard-earned gift that Dr. Patel had begged for the devotees was down to just a few remnants. And finally, the last mosquito net, the last pillow, the last blanket, and the last mattress all disappeared--there was not even a trace, not a single thread.\nSo one day, again on a morning walk, Dr. Patel brought up the topic of his gift of the twelve sets of bedding, complaining to Srila Prabhupada that the devotees hadn't take care of them and that now nothing was left. Srila Prabhupada replied, \"You know the reason? These boys and girls who have come to serve me don't identify with the body. They don't care if they have a mattress or a pillow or a mosquito net or a blanket. As long as they can chant the holy name and serve their spiritual master, they're satisfied.\" And then he said, \"That moksa that you are so eager to get, they already have.\"\nIn a very skillful and intelligent way, Srila Prabhupada had expressed his appreciation for the devotees, and he had spoken in such a way as to humble Dr. Patel and make him understand how exalted the devotees actually were. Of course, as we've matured, we've understood more about the principle of yukta-vairagya, about taking care of Krsna's property--not for our sense gratification, but for Krsna's service. But still, what Srila Prabhupada said was true.\nSo, Srila Prabhupada was merciful to us, his disciples, and he was merciful to Dr. Patel. He was merciful to everyone. He was an ocean of mercy. And if we can come close to that ocean, if some waves from that ocean hit us and eventually carry us into that ocean, our lives will be perfect, and we will be able to touch others with some waves from that ocean, and they will also benefit.\nHare Krsna\n\n","nid":"4148"},{
"title":"Transcription of a Talk Given at Tina's Yoga Studio in Taipei","ref":"","attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Sun, 2011-05-22 23:07","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially-edited transcription of a talk given at Tina's Yoga Studio in Taipei, Taiwan on March 15, 2011\n \nI\u2019m very happy to be here this evening with all of you and to have this opportunity to share with you what I have been practicing for almost forty years. I was first introduced to this mantra-yoga early in the 1970's. At that time I was a university student, studying Eastern philosophy and I became attracted to reading different books on philosophy. And since I was also a teenager in 1960's in America, I think you might know what this means. I had been exposed to a lot of what the 1960's had to offer, and as a result I began searching for some greater means for achieving a sense of peace.\n\"Peace\" was a very popular word in the 1960's in America, because many people my age were going to war in Vietnam. Many of of them were fighting in that war and were lost in that war. There were a lot of demonstrations in America; people wanted peace. Although everyone wanted peace, we began to observe that conflict was still very prevalent. Conflict existed between people, between communities, between nations. I began to observe that conflict was also something within each and every person. By my own direct experience I experienced conflict within. Many things I wanted and couldn\u2019t have, and there were many things I had and didn\u2019t want. After observing that inner conflict I began looking for something that could bring me a sense of balance between the two.\nTherefore, at that stage of my life, I began studying, as I said, different types of Eastern philosophy, I practiced different forms of meditation and then I was introduced to mantra-yoga after studying the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita. I found that Bhagavad-gita and the philosophy it contains could give me a practical way to resolve the internal conflicts. But it wasn't just a part-time experience.\nSometimes we may sit down and try to resolve our internal conflict for a part of the day and it will make us temporarily peaceful. Although it\u2019s a nice experience and peacefulness is there, but when we start to pursue our other activities throughout the day they come into conflict with the harmony that we were earlier looking for within ourselves. So, after practicing mantra-yoga for some time I began to look for the way to harmonize my internal thoughts with my day-to-day activities. But that came later, because I could see that there was still conflict.\nSo that is the nature of this world - it is a place of conflict both internal and external. It is a world of duality - good and bad, heat and cold, honor and dishonor. There is a verse in Bhagavad-Gita: \"For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is reached and he attains tranquility. For such a man 'heat' and 'cold', \u2018happiness\u2019 and \u2018distress\u2019, \u2018honour\u2019 and \u2018dishonor\u2019 are all the same.\u201d In other words, when one conquers the mind, it doesn't simply bring about a peaceful state of mind. But it brings the mind to a higher state of consciousness, a higher awareness of a reality that is beyond the dualities of this world.\nIt\u2019s not that peace means devoid of consciousness. Consciousness is always there. Sometimes you may try to get rid of bad thoughts. The mind is so active. But you still have to think about getting rid of bad thoughts. We were just giving the example\u2014 to control the mind is like trying to control the wind. It is very hard to control the mind by our own endeavors alone.\nJust like the example is given; if you enter into a river you try to stop the waves of the river, with your own strength it is very difficult to stop the waves of the river. But when the waves of the river enter into the ocean, the power of the ocean is much stronger and has an influence on the waves of the river. The ocean is compared to that transcendental realm, that transcendental awareness which is the Supreme truth, which is beyond the dualities of this worldand which reconciles all the dualities of this world.\nThere is another verse about duality. I\u2019d like to mention that verse. I mentioned it the other day. \"Although the duality of this world does not ultimately exist, the conditioned soul experiences it as real due to the influence of his conditioned intelligence. This imaginary experience of a world which is separate from Krsna can be compared to the acts of dreaming and desiring. When a conditioned soul dreams of something desirable or something horrible or when he daydreams of something he would like to have or something he would like to avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his imagination.\"\nI would like to explain this verse so that it\u2019s not simply some irrelevant verse. I would like to try to connect it with some practical experience. A person at night might be dreaming. I\u2019m sure all of you have experienced dreaming. There are good dreams and bad dreams. So at night you may have a very good dream - maybe you are dreaming you are with a favourite person you would like to be with or you are dreaming you are a king or a queen, and you have opulence - something very nice you are enjoying. But then you wake up you realize it was only a dream. Although it was a good dream when you wake up you feel sad because it was only a dream. So now you are feeling sad. If you have a bad dream - somebody is attacking you, you are about to be eaten by a tiger, your plane is about to crash, when you wake up you are happy. \"It\u2019s just a dream!\" You look around and think: \u201cIt\u2019s very nice. It was a dream and now I\u2019m happy.\u201d But before you woke up, when you were having a good dream, you became sad. And now when you wake up because it is a bad dream, you are happy. But the experience of happiness or distress is not connected to reality; it is connected only to a dream. All the happiness and distress was simply connected to something that wasn\u2019t real.\nSo that\u2019s the night dream. Then there is the daydream. We daydream about something we\u2019d like to have or something we would like to avoid. We talked about that before as one of the internal conflicts. Something that I don't have but I dream about the day that I can have it. It\u2019s also a dream. We are taught, especially now in America, we see on the billboards all over, 'dream big' Or you may know now there is a very famous singer who became popular because she sang a song \"I had a dream\" on a talent show- Susan Boyle. She was a very ordinary person, but after singing that song she became world- famous.\nYes, we can dream big and people have their daydreams of how they can become happy. But just because they get the fulfillment of their dreams it doesn\u2019t mean that it's going to automatically make them happy. More distress will come . Just like sometimes people dream of becoming wealthy and they may even become wealthy. But they are also in anxiety. They have so much wealth that they don\u2019t even know who their friends are. They think: \"Is this person my friend because of me or because I\u2019m wealthy?\" Then they think: \u201cWhat will I do with all my wealth? How do I spend it? How do I invest it? How do I protect it? I could lose it any moment.\u201d So they had a dream that being wealthy meant being happy, but then being wealthy means so much anxiety to maintain it. But during the daydream they thought \"That\u2019s very nice, I\u2019ll be happy if I have the fulfillment of my dream.\"\nSo the daydream means we dream about something we would like to have or something we would like to avoid. So many things that happen to us we don\u2019t want to happen - we don\u2019t want the stock markets to crash, we don\u2019t want disease, we don\u2019t want to get in an accident, we try to avoid conflict with people \u2013 so many things we try to avoid.\nSo, these are all described as daydreams. But they are very similar to night dreams because they\u2019re still within the realm of duality. Therefore, wherever there is duality, there is an internal conflict. This verse describes the nature of duality. \nTherefore, the intelligent person will control the mind, restricting it from the tendency to see things separate from Krshna or transcendence. When the mind is thus controlled, one will experience actual fearlessness.\nFear comes because we don\u2019t know what lies in the future. But for one who is situated in transcendental consciousness or, as explained in Bhagavad-Gita, one who is not connected to the Supreme can have neither transcendental intelligence nor controlled mind without which can be no peace. How can there be happiness without peace!\nMantra yoga is the endeavor to connect the mind to the Supreme. It is not an ordinary sound vibration, it is a spiritual sound vibration. There is a verse \u2018golokera prema dana harinama sankirtana\u2019 which means that the Hare Krsna mantra is imported from the spiritual world. It\u2019s not a sound vibration of this world. The sound vibrations of this world are simply names of different forms of this world and the name is different from the substance.\nIf I\u2019m thirsty and I chant \u2018water, water, water\u2019 or if I chant \u2018coca-cola, coca-cola, coca-cola\u2019, it won\u2019t quench my thirst, because the name \u2018water\u2019 and the substance \u2018water\u2019 are different. The name \u2018Krsna\u2019 is a transcendental vibration and the Hare Krsna mantra is actually imported directly from the transcendental world, a realm beyond this temporary world of duality. When we chant this mantra and hear the vibration, we are importing that sound vibration from the place beyond this world and the consciousness becomes transformed from the realm of duality to the realm of the Absolute.\nIt takes time. That full absolute consciousness will not manifest immediately. But one can experience even with a little endeavor a temporary glimpse of transcendence. Like a window. You get to look through the window of what is beyond this temporary world of duality. And upon attaining that experience, it gives us the impetus to go on.\nThere is one verse and I\u2019ll end with this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam that states: \"What is the value of a prolonged life which is wasted, inexperienced by years in this world? Better a moment of full consciousness, because that gives one a start in searching after his supreme interest. (SB 2.1.12). One moment of full consciousness is much better than a lifetime of fearfulness. So if we get just one moment of full consciousness from chanting and that will be sufficient to help us along the path of continuous chanting, so that one can enter into this state of Krsna consiousness.\nThank you very much.\n","nid":"3678"},{

[Formatted document is available at the bottom.]\n\n[Guru Maharaja starts lecture here]\nReading from Srimad-Bhagavatam, Canto 9, Chapter 14, text 1. No commentary. This is a beginning of the chapter. So I am going to read first chapter summary, and then we'll continue with texts 1-3. \n\"SUMMARY: The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows. This chapter describes Soma and how he kidnapped the wife of Brhaspati and begot in her womb a son named Budha. Budha begot Pururava, who begot six sons, headed by Ayu, in the womb of Urvasi.\nLord Brahma was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakasayi Visnu. Brahma had a son named Atri, and Atri's son was Soma, the king of all drugs and stars. Soma became the conqueror of the entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tara, who was the wife of Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods. A great fight ensued between the demigods and the asuras, but Brahma rescued Brhaspati's wife from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her husband, thus stopping the fighting. In the womb of Tara, Soma begot a son named Budha, who later begot in the womb of Ila a son named Aila, or Pururava. Urvasi was captivated by Pururava's beauty, and therefore she lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he became almost like a madman. While traveling all over the world, he met Urvasi again at Kuruksetra, but she agreed to join with him for only one night in a year.\nOne year later, Pururava saw Urvasi at Kuruksetra and was glad to be with her for one night, but when he thought of her leaving him again, he was overwhelmed by grief. Urvasi then advised Pururava to worship the Gandharvas. Being satisfied with Pururava, the Gandharvas gave him a woman known as Agnisthali. Pururava mistook Agnisthali for Urvasi, but while he was wandering in the forest his misunderstanding was cleared, and he immediately gave up her company. After returning home and meditating upon Urvasi all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire. Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisthali, and there he saw that from the womb of a sami tree had come an asvattha tree. Pururava made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a fire. By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty desires. The fire was considered the son of Pururava. In Satya-yuga there was only one social division, called hamsa; there were no divisions of varna like brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. The Veda was the omkara. The various demigods were not worshiped, for only the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.\"\nTEXT 1\nsri-suka uvaca\nathatah sruyatam rajan\nvamsah somasya pavanah\nyasminn ailadayo bhupah\nkirtyante punya-kirtayah\n\"Srila Sukadeva Gosvami said to Maharaja Pariksit: O King, thus far you have heard the description of the dynasty of the sun-god. Now hear the most glorious and purifying description of the dynasty of the moon-god. This description mentions kings like Aila [Pururava] of whom it is glorious to hear.\"\nTEXT 2\nsahasra-sirasah pumso\nnabhi-hrada-saroruhat\njatasyasit suto dhatur\natrih pitr-samo gunaih\n\"Lord Visnu [Garbhodakasayi Visnu] is also known as Sahasra-sirsa Purusa. From the lake of His navel sprang a lotus, on which Lord Brahma was generated. Atri, the son of Lord Brahma, was as qualified as his father.\"\nTEXT 3\ntasya drgbhyo 'bhavat putrah\nsomo 'mrtamayah kila\nviprausadhy-udu-gananam\nbrahmana kalpitah patih\n\"From Atri's tears of jubilation was born a son named Soma, the moon, who was full of soothing rays. Lord Brahma appointed him the director of the brahmanas, drugs and luminaries.\"\n\"PURPORT: According to the Vedic description, Soma, the moon-god, was born from the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (candrama manaso jatah). But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in the eyes of Atri. This appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but actually it is not, for this birth of the moon is understood to have taken place in another millennium. When tears appear in the eyes because of jubilation, the tears are soothing. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, drgbhya anandasrubhya ata evamrtamayah: \"Here the word drgbhyah means 'from tears of jubilation.' Therefore the moon-god is called amrtamayah, 'full of soothing rays.' \" In the Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.1.15) we find this verse:\natreh patny anasuya trin\njajne suyasasah sutan\ndattam durvasasam somam\natmesa-brahma-sambhavan\nThis verse describes that Anasuya, the wife of Atri Rsi, bore three sons \u2014 Soma, Durvasa and Dattatreya. It is said that at the time of conception Anasuya was impregnated by the tears of Atri.\" [Srimad-Bhagavatam 9.14.1-3]\nBefore I begin, let me say that I am very happy to be here with the devotees of Sri-Sri Radha-Gopinatha Mandir. I cannot remember the last time I've sat here and gave class. It was quite some time ago. I've not been traveling so much over the last two years. \nAnd as a matter of fact, usually I have to apologize when I land in the place where I am supposed to give class just speaking continuously in English, because for the last two years I've been in East Europe, except for a just a short visit to America. So, I am quite accustomed to speaking in fragments. And it's very difficult when I land in a place where I can speak straight English, as my mind is used to stopping in between every fragment and thinking. I'll adjust, but if you see me struggling, that's one of the reasons. My apology. This is actually my first class since East Europe. Oh, actually, I did speak the other night too. I forgot.\nBut I am always happy to be here with all of you. I've always considered this temple to be like my home, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to spending some more time at home in the future, now that I am able to travel a little bit more. I just hope that you will accept me for what I am, which is not very much of a contributor in any way, but I come to take your association and to become purified, which is the responsibility of every aspiring devotee.\nSo I come here for that purpose. But here I am, sitting in front of all of you speaking from Srimad-Bhagavatam. So, I apologize and I'll try to say something relevant.\nSo, I didn't expect to be speaking from this section of the Bhagavatam - about tears - but since the verse and the commentary is on this topic, we'll say something in this connection. It's explained here that Atri Muni, from his tears of jubilation, gave birth to Soma. Prabhupada quotes from the 4th Canto of the Bhagavatam, which describes how Atri Muni had performed austerities, standing on one leg as he wanted to get a son who was as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada explains in the commentary that because Atri Muni didn't want the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, but rather he wanted a son as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, therefore he is not a pure devotee, Prabhupada said in that commentary, that this desire was not pure. Had it been pure, he would have desired to have the Supreme Lord as his son. Nonetheless, because of his austerities and because of his desire, the predominating Deities of the universe - Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu and Lord Siva - appeared before him and They gave him the benediction that, \"We are all coming ultimately from the Supreme Lord Visnu, and therefore you will receive a son that is as good as the Supreme Lord.\"\nIt is described that from Anusuya came Dattatreya, Soma and Durvasa. And Soma was considered to be a partial expansion of Lord Brahma. Prabhupada quotes the verse here that, at that time, the method of conception was done by the tears of Atri Muni. And here, in this verse, it's described that he had tears of jubilation. He was very happy. \nI quoted this reference recently in connection with something else, and I am pretty sure it was in reference to Dhruva Maharaja. Yes, when Dhruva Maharaja returned from the forest, and king Uttanapada received him after not seeing him for an extensive period of time, he took Dhruva on his lap and embraced him, rubbed his head, and tears came from his eyes.\nPrabhupada said in the commentary that, by nature's way, when a man cries, there are two causes. He says that first cause is when a man is experiencing happiness because of the fulfillment of a desire. Then his tears are cool. Very cool. And when a man is feeling distress, his tears are hot. So, here we see that Atri Muni had tears of jubilation, and they were described as cool, and as we know cool was soothing. Now, although it doesn't explain here why he was feeling these tears of jubilation at time of conception, nonetheless we can understand that, as Prabhupada explained, that when there is fulfillment of some desire one feels jubilation.\nAnd, as we also heard, Atri Muni was not pure devotee. He had some other desires, mixed desires. So, he was feeling some jubilation, some happiness, that was coming from the fulfillment of his desires. \nAs we know, all desires can ultimately be fulfilled by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. There are many examples given in the Bhagavatam: Dhruva Maharaja is one example. He had his desire fulfilled in a way that was even more than he expected. He wanted to have a kingdom greater than Lord Brahma's, and he got the fulfillment of his desire beyond his expectation. Nonetheless, the desire was fulfilled by the Lord. \nWhen Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest to perform austerities, his very determined desire was to have that kingdom. He had feelings of vengeance, he was very disturbed with the fact that his stepmother would not allow him to sit on the lap of his father. He thought he had equal opportunity to be able to sit on the lap of his father. Therefore in this mood he went to the forest and was told by his mother that he'll have to approach the Supreme Lord if he wanted the fulfillment of any desire. He performed austerities, and the Lord appeared before him as a result of his austerities. Then Dhruva Maharaja realized, \"I have come here for a piece of a broken glass, and instead I've found the most valuable jewel.\" His vision, his darshan with the Lord was the fulfillment of all his desires beyond his expectation. \nThe Lord, being very much inclined to satisfy His devotee, wanted to reciprocate and give something in return - which is the nature of the relationship between the Lord and the devotee. Although the devotee is fully satisfied, because all of his desires are fulfilled by seeing the Lord - at such time, upon the experiencing both the presence and the reciprocation of the Lord, there is no desire left in the heart. Therefore the devotee simply prays, \"Let me have an opportunity to serve You, birth after birth after birth.\" Or the devotee may pray, \"Please, let me take birth simply in association of Your devotees, birth after birth after birth.\"\nA devotee doesn't want the fulfillment of any desire other than the desire which gives him the opportunity to hear, to chant, to glorify and to remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead - even if it's birth after birth after birth after birth. It's irrelevant. Why? Because remembering the Lord, hearing about the Lord, glorifying the Lord is so satisfying, that there is no room for any other desire. It is so satisfying to the heart.\nsrnvatam sva-kathah krsnah\npunya-sravana-kirtanah\nhrdy antah stho hy abhadrani\nvidhunoti suhrt satam\n\"Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.\" [Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.2.17]\nThe Lord removes all obstacles on the path of devotional service, and therefore He gives one full satisfaction. Complete. But the Lord, as we know, wants to give something in return - it is the nature of that reciprocal relationship between the Lord and His devotee. \nWe have oftentimes explained,, as described in the 9th Canto of the Bhagavatam, how the Lord becomes so much inclined when the devotee accepts the Lord within his heart, serves the Lord within his heart, remembers the Lord within his heart \u2013 that the Lord wants to give something in return. But the devotee says, \"No, I don't want. This is it. I am satisfied. I reached the goal, the culmination, fulfillment of all desires. I don't want anything! Jut let me serve You. Let me remember You.\"\nThere are many examples when the Lord would even provoke, \"I want to give you something. I want to give you something. Please accept!\" As he told Kolavecha Sridhara. \"I will make you a king. I'll give you a kingdom.\" Why? Why would he offer such a thing? He wanted Kolavecha to reveal his true colors. Why? Because Kolavecha had been living in extreme poverty, and obviously somebody in poverty must want wealth. So, he said, \"I'll make you a king. Enjoy a kingdom.\"\nKolavecha Sridhara said, \"No, please, You simply let me be Your servant, and You be my master birth after birth. That is all I ask. Let me remember You always.\"\nSatisfied. The Lord wants to give something, but the devotee always comes back saying, \"No. I don't want.\"\nPrahlada Maharaja said the same thing, \"Why are you offering me benediction? I shouldn't take such risks. Remember, I was born in a family of demons. Why should I take such risk by asking for some benediction from You?\" Prahlada Maharaja also refused and didn't want it. He was not interested. \nSo although the devotee is disinclined to accept any benediction from the Lord... We even just the other night were telling the story of Sudama Vipra. Sudama Vipra came to see his classmate Lord Krsna, with a few grains of broken rice, at the prompting of his wife, \"Go, take this rice and ask Him. Why do you have to live in poverty. Your friend is Lord Krsna. He can give you anything.\"\nSo, under the pressure, he went, but the last thing on his mind was to ask Krsna for something. Last thing. In fact, it didn't even exist. If it is \"last thing\" - it implies it's there. It didn't even exist in his mind! And as we know, the Lord took the broken rice that Sudama Vipra had brought with him, and He very eagerly took the rice right from his hand, and began eating it. Rukmini, the goddess of fortune, who was fanning Him when He went take some more rice, she stopped Him, \"No, please, don't eat anymore. If you take any more I don't think I'll have sufficient opulence to repay Sudama. Stop here!\"\nSo, Sudama left and didn't ask, but when he returned home he saw this beautiful palace, and he understood... There is one verse in 10th Canto of the Bhagavatam which describes that the Lord considers any benediction that He can give [and the Lord can definitely give some big benedictions - planets, universes, opulences. We see so many examples in the Bhagavatam how the Lord gave planets to His devotees to reside upon.] But Sudama Vipra was saying that the Lord considers any benediction that He can give, to be completely insignificant in comparison to even the smallest offering made with affection by His devotee. \nHe said that because it is the Lord\u2019s nature, that whatever the devotee offers - although externally it may appear to be very insignificant - the Lord always magnifies it. He makes it something very big. This is Sudama Vipra describing the characteristics and qualities of the Lord. Otherwise why would Rukmini stop Krsna from taking a second handful of rice? Because the value of those few grains of broken rice from the hands of Sudama Vipra was so high that for her to reciprocate, she didn't have sufficient opulences to give in return for those few grains. Imagine if there had been a second handful? She said, \"I would have exhausted all of my opulences.\"\nSo, our value system is based upon that which brings pleasure to the Lord. Therefore we see so many examples of how the Lord speaks about the glories of His devotees who apparently, by external vision, live as renunciates. Lord Caitanya considered Ragunatha Dasa's feast - when he was taking the rejected rice that even the cows wouldn't eat, and he was breaking open the grains of rice and taking the inner husk, washing them off and eating them, to be the most opulent feast, so much so that He was indignant that He wasn't invited. Raghunath Dasa\u2019s renunciation was his wealth and the Lord considered that wealth to be valuable and that which was pleasing to Him.\nIn the Bhagavatam it says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to those devotees who have no material possessions, but who are fully satisfied in possessing only devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Indeed that the Lord relishes the activities of such devotees. Those who are proud of possessing their wealth - being puffed up by their aristocracy, high education, bodily beauty - because of their pride they will generally deride devotees of the Lord. They will make fun of them. And even though such person may offer the Lord worship, the Lord will never accept it. Never accept it! It can't bring Him pleasure. The Lord can't feel pleasure by the offerings of somebody who doesn't know the real value of devotional service.\nTherefore, such persons may come forward offering such worldly opulence, but that's not the criteria for pleasing the Lord. He is not pleased simply because of some worldly opulences offered to Him. He is pleased when it is offered with the desire to please Him. One can't purchase the Supreme Lord by one\u2019s opulence. It's not what attracts Him. It's the heart. You can't negotiate a deal with the Lord with opulence, \"Give me more wealth, give me high education, bodily beauty.\" [Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.8.26]\njanmaisvarya-sruta-sribhir\nedhamana-madah puman\nNo. The Lord cannot be petitioned in this way. So, the value of an offering is in it\u2019s ability to please the Lord. Because the Lord is bhava-grahi (He understands the essence of the person's attitude), and that's what makes it pleasing to the Lord.\nSo, when the Lord becomes so pleased, because of that attitude - that the devotee's happiness, his jubilation, his joy is coming from the fulfillment of his desire to offer something to the Lord. And when the Lord accepts it. That is his joy. That is his happiness. That's what gives a devotee pleasure. And when the Lord sees that the devotee has no other desire within his heart but to please Him, He actually wants to give something valuable in return.\nSo, as we explained before, although the Lord may offer, \"Let me give you this, let me give you that\", the devotee again and again and again says, \"No, I don't want it. I don't want it.\" A devotee will sometimes compete with the Lord.\nThen, the Lord says, \"Ok, even though you don't ask, I am still going to give you something valuable.\" The Lord gives His heart. There is nothing of greater value than when the Lord gives His heart to His devotee, because the devotee will never reject the heart of the Lord. Because that's what He is always carrying within His heart. That's what Krsna said to Durvasa Muni, \"The devotee is in My heart, and I am always in the heart of My devotee. A devotee is always thinking about Me, and I am not thinking about anyone but him.\"\nSo, a devotee is always very eager to accept the Lord in his heart. He'll never reject that. He will never say, \"No, Lord, stay out of my heart, please. I don't want You.\" So, therefore, the Lord gives Himself and His heart. That is what satisfies the devotee. \nSo, this is understood to be real happiness, not the jubilation coming from the fulfillment of some material desire. One may get the fulfillment of some desire, and he may feel tears of joy and happiness, and as we said such tears are soothing, like the moon which is soothing. One may also feel distress, and then one may feel hot tears. But this happiness and distress of this world, we have to transcend. First verse I ever learned was in a parking lot on book distribution on my first day on sankirtana. \nmatra-sparsas tu kaunteya\nsitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah\nagamapayino 'nityas\ntams titiksasva bharata\n\"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\" [Bhagavad-gita 2.14]\nIt was tough. My first Bhagavad-Gita verse. Still there somehow. Everything else falls away as time passes, but somehow that first one sticks.\nSo, it's not just material happiness. As it's described here that Atri Muni gave birth to Soma because he was feeling great happiness because of fulfillment of a desire, and therefore his tears of joy manifested, he impregnated Anusuya, and Soma took birth as the moon-god, and from Soma comes the soothing rays of the moon.\nIf we really want to feel soothing, real soothing happiness, what could be more soothing than nitai-pada-kamala, koti-candra-susitala. We talked about how soothing the rays of the moon manifest. But what could be as soothing as thousands of moons than the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord Nityananda. When one takes shelter of the lotus feet of Nityananda, then those lotus feet are more soothing than thousands and thousands and thousands of moons. And what does the moon do? As we know, the moon eradicates the heat of suffering, of pain. Soothing rays of the moon.\nPrabhupada speaks about how, after the scorching heat of the sunshine, one is very eager to take the soothing rays of the moon, the cool moon night rays after the scorching heat of the day. Of course, we know that also the scorching heat can be put out by unlimited water. But if it doesn't come before the night time, then the soothing rays of the moon will eradicate the heat of the scorching sun. \nSo, in the same way that Lord Nityananda - whose appearance day is coming in just a few days, isn't it? Yes. Sixteenth - His lotus feet are more soothing than thousands and thousands of moons. And if one takes shelter of the Lord Nityananda, or the representative of Lord Nityananda, then all the unwanted desires within the heart can become completely eradicated, purified. And then one can feel genuine happiness. Real happiness. Brahma-saukyam. Real happiness which continues forever. Not the temporary happiness that may appear from the fulfillment of some temporary desire, but the permanent happiness which comes when the Lord fulfills the desires of His devotee by giving him the greatest benediction\u2014the opportunity to be engaged in pure, unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Lord. This satisfies all the desires of His devotee and automatically makes him completely freed from all material suffering.\nSo, I didn't really speak about Atri Muni, but somehow we felt that because Prabhupada spoke about tears, then we should try, or aspire, to also experience tears of happiness that the devotee experiences; joy upon receiving the greatest benediction, which is the opportunity to please the Lord with pure, unalloyed devotional service. Therefore, we feel such joy, such happiness by the association of devotees, by whose association we can also cleanse away the unwanted desires within the heart.\nActually, the first time I saw Srila Prabhupada, I cannot remember if the tears were cold or hot, but there were definitely tears in my eyes. And if we take Prabhupada's statements to be perfect, as they always are, then they must have been cool. Because certainly I was feeling great happiness upon seeing the devotee, who by his mere presence and by mere vision of him, immediately makes one feel that he has hope for pleasing the Lord; immediately makes one have confidence and faith that discussion about pure devotional service is something that is achievable, attainable and possible by the mercy of such Vaisnavas who come and walk on this planet to purify this world by their presence.\nKrsna says, \"By the dust of the lotus feet of My pure devotee I desire to purify this entire material world, which is situated within Me, and thus I always follow in the footsteps of these devotees, taking their dust.\" Krsna certifies that He also experiences such great joy simply to see His pure devotees. We should aspire for such joy. \nI think I will end here. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna.\nAny questions?\n[Devotee] Thank you Maharaja for your wonderful class. I got a question in my mind in the beginning when you were mentioning how devotee feels happiness in hearing and chanting about Krsna, and you quoted that verse srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah. So at that time I just got this question because many times we hear and chant, and we actually feel happy in dancing in kirtans and chanting. At the same time, we are not hearing only Krsna-katha because of the services we have, like institutional structure, management. And we may sometimes have to hear some things which are not very palatable, about some scandals or controversy or some problems. Not that we are hunting for this news but if you are in management you get to hear them. And that is not only negative kind of subject, but it also sucks our consciousness, and whatever taste we have for hearing and chanting, that sometimes goes too.\nI want to know how to deal with this negativity, how to deal with things which are not directly Krsna katha, but because of our service we may have to hear certain things. So how do we deal with the negativity that we hear in this world?\nAnd also when counseling people, those things also come up. How do we deal with this?\n[Guru Maharaja] Well, you made an important criteria for hearing, in the first place. And that cannot be understated, that there is a criteria for having to hear it. But, unfortunately, sometimes devotees forget what the criteria is and they take the first opportunity they get to hear something which has no immediate connection with them, no importance to them, and neither are they the empowered or responsible persons to correct the situation. \nSo, first criteria is that one should not be interested in hearing them, unless he has a responsibility for hearing them. So, if we take that into consideration, then it limits what we have to hear. I know that your question was specifically within the limited frame of reference that you spoke about, for those who have to hear it. But I thought we should emphasize first that there are many who don't have to hear it, who shouldn't hear it, and by the mere fact that they want to hear it, is testimony that they are not qualified to hear it. Because nobody wants to hear these things. \nA devotee by nature is supposed to be adosa-darsi. Adosa-darsi means that wherever he looks, he sees no fault. Haridasa Pandita is adosa-darsi. There are so many examples of adosa-darsi given in Caitanya-Caritamrta. We are not looking for the faults. \nIn fact, one of my favorite Prabhupada letters - that famous letter to Atreya Rsi, where he talks about Utopia. Prabhupada talks about how even in the spiritual world there are faults. He gives the example that one time Krsna was so captivated by the beauty of Radharani, that He began milking a bull. Prabhupada gave that as an example of how even in spiritual world there are faults. And he said also that the gopis, if we analyze them, are also running into the forest in the dead of the night, and they weren't even dressed properly. They had their upper cloth on the bottom, and their bottom cloth on the upper part of their body. So, he said this was not right. So, even in the spiritual world we see faults. \nSo he said, but because there are faults even in the spiritual world. we should not be like the Utopians who think that there should be no faults in this world. He said, \"No, there is even fault in the spiritual world.\" And he gave other examples as well.\nHe compared the Utopians to be like impersonalists. Impersonalists expects that everything should be just completely perfect, and whenever they see some fault, they want to have nothing to do with it. That's the impersonal tendency. He said, \"But the devotee understands that there will be fault even in this world, but he is not looking for it.\" And he gives the well known example, one that Prabhupada always gives, that a fly will always go to the sore, while the bees will always go for the nectar. So, he said that we should not be like the flies, so eager to look for the sores. We should be like the bees, who are always looking for the nectar. Always looking for the good.\nSo, if our responsibility is to always look for the good, why should we be interested in hearing something which is negative? We shouldn't be interested. There is more to that letter, but let's get to the essence of your question.\nYes, we sometimes have to hear things that may appear to be negative, but the devotee is one who is supposed to take that which is negative and make it positive. Prabhupada, somewhere in the Bhagavatam in the commentary, gives the example that whenever a negative event happens in the devotee's life - he gave Haridasa Thakura as an example, Jesus Christ as an example, gave different Vaisnavas as examples, who all had to confront negative events - but the devotee took that negative event and turned it into something positive. \nSo, those who have the responsibility to take the negative and turn it into something positive, they may have to hear such events that may appear to be negative. But they should take it with the understanding that, \"Let me try to take this situation and turn it into something that is favorable for the person who\u2019s been a victim of the negative, as well as for the person who may have committed the negative. Let me try to give a Krsna conscious solution, not a diplomatic solution.\" A Krsna conscious solution. Because without Krsna consciousness, solutions, as we oftentimes find, are very temporary. And they create further friction. \nThere is a verse in the Bhagavatam where Narada Muni is speaking to king Pracinabarhisat. He says that persons who try to eradicate distress by engaging in another activity which is similarly motivated, is just like a person who awakens from a bad dream with a bad hallucination. Doesn't really correct the problem. He says that one has to fully awaken to Krsna consciousness, and full awakening means awakening to Krsna consciousness, as the solution to the problems of this world. \nSo, we should hear such topics and we should not be impulsive. We should try to give a Krsna conscious solution to the problem which will benefit all parties concerned. Because if there is conflict, which is oftentimes what we have to hear... [It's the kind of stuff that sends my blood pressure up. It's the stuff we don't want to hear. \"Why am I forced into hearing this for 25 years now?\" I don't want to hear.] but I also know what's it is like when you deliberately and tearfully pray to give a Krsna conscious solution to the problems. Then, at least, we've done our part. Others may not be able to accept it. Whether they accept or don't accept, it's their choice. But we've done our part. \nAnd then, even though the result may not be as we hoped, as we expected, although often times if we do it with the proper motivation, Krsna has a way of stepping in. [Bhagavad-Gita 9.22]\ntesam nityabhiyuktanam\nyoga-ksemam vahamy aham\nKrsna has a way of stepping in. That because you depended upon Him and looked for a Krsna conscious solution, He will step in and help resolve it in a way where everyone can benefit; and parties can come, offer obeisance to each other, and cry. \"I've committed an offence.\" It's possible. We have to have hope that such situations are possible. \nSo, if you hear with that intent, and act in that way, then there is less of the tendency to be negatively impacted. Of course, if it's in small doses. If it gets too much, then you also don't need to hear. Take a break. Because you have to be Krsna conscious. As we said, only Krsna consciousness can bring about a solution. So, if you are bombarded by it, take a break, and come back and revisit it at a later time, when you can deal with it in a Krsna conscious way.\nAll right, I didn't expect to take such a long time with answering that question, but I have to end here. Is that ok if I end it here? Ok. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna.\nSrila Prabhupada ki Jaya!\n[Devotee] His Holiness Srila Niranjana Swami Maharaja ki Jaya!\n\n[Guru Maharaja end lecture here]\n\n","nid":"3503"},{

Even today, we hear devotees using it not only amongst themselves but also in presenting Krsna Consciousness philosophy to non-devotees.\nI remember when I was a temple president in Boston about 30 years ago. I would spend a substantial amount of time preaching in the universities in Boston, because there are many (about hundred) colleges and Universities in Boston. And I would oftentimes be invited to give presentations to the students in their classrooms; sometimes as often as 4-5 times a week. A common dilemma that many of the students used to have about our philosophy was, \"What do we do for our happiness?\" \nThe students were always analyzing our lifestyles. They were mostly interested to know what we do from morning to night. According to their calculations, we don\u2019t do anything fun! This was probably one of the most common question I received from the students, \"What do you people do for fun? You wake up early in the morning and pray, but everything you do is for Krsna. You know, everybody has to have to fun in life. What\u2019s your fun?\" They couldn\u2019t accommodate in their minds that a monastic type of lifestyle could possibly be satisfying. Because to have fun means to them, to do all the things that we don\u2019t do! \nI remember many times speaking about this conception, \"simple living and high thinking\". To live in an asrama or temple, you are forced into a situation where you have to live simply. But our movement was still young in those days and the movement has gone through a transformation in that it has been a struggle to keep intact this concept of simple living and high thinking for those who became householders.\nI have personally observed over the years, especially in America, many attempts to preserve this concept of \"simple living and high thinking\" in a rural setting like this. I use the word \"attempt\" because I have not been able to observe anything manifest to the degree of success as that which I've observed here in New Vraja Dhama. And when I measure the degree of success in the fulfillment of \"simple living and high thinking\" which is manifested here in relationship to all the other attempts throughout the world, I have to use the word \"attempt\" in relationship to many other communities as opposed to what I see here.\nMy humble opinion is that this community in New Vraja Dhama is the flagship of \"simple living and high thinking\" for our International Society for Krsna Consciousness. Every other attempt which is manifested in other parts of the world can only be measured in relationship to what New Vraja Dhama is setting as the pace for the rest of the world.\nBy making these statements, I don\u2019t wish in any way to diminish or belittle the efforts that are made by many leaders throughout the world to establish a community similar to this. But I have been in many communities. I have been asked to participate and even to take a leading role to encourage and inspire the devotees in some communities in America. But I observed there a particular resistance to \"simple living and high thinking\". Devotees were resisting the ideal of how to keep their life simple enough that they could be satisfied with the simple necessities of life. Oftentimes, there would be quarrelling amongst devotees and it was very hard for them to establish a center for their community because we know the success of simple living and high thinking is based upon putting Krsna at the center. It\u2019s impossible to feel any satisfaction internally with the simple necessities of life unless we experience a higher taste in Krsna Consciousness. It\u2019s simply the most important aspect of our philosophy-- that satisfaction comes internally to the degree that Krsna is pleased by our activities.\nbhajaniya-parama-purusa-sukha-matra-sva-sukhatvam (Srila Jiva Gosvami wrote in his Sandarbha; SB 2.3.10, Purport)\nTRANSLATION:\nOne should feel happy only by experiencing the happiness of the Supreme Lord. \nThat means to the degree that Krsna is pleased to that degree we will get the satisfaction from within.\nSo New Vraja Dhama is a very important project for removing the skepticism in the minds and hearts of these students and non-devotees that we can be satisfied by living simply. This is a place where I can bring all those skeptical students to come and let them see for themselves how we can be happy by living simply with Radha Syamasundara at the center of our lives.\nYou are very fortunate that your leaders have impressed this upon you in such a way that it\u2019s not only become an integral part of your life but it\u2019s become your whole life. And I cannot think of any greater benediction that one can possibly have than to be able to live a life with Radha Syamasundara at the center of your life. If you can simply remain happy to please Them\u2014 to live your life with Them at your center\u2014 then living in such simple facilities like this would not be an austerity but rather it will be a great pleasure.\nKesava Bharati das Goswami: It would be an opulence.\nNiranjana Swami continues: People cannot realize what real opulences are. This is the most opulent life. Don't ever be fooled to think that the goddess of fortune who could provide the opulences that are available even in the Vaiku\u00eb\u00f6ha planets could surpass the opulences of New Vraja Dhama. All opulences are manifested here and that\u2019s why we can feel so satisfied. You are all the wealthiest people. You have the greatest wealth! Now hold it; keep that to your hearts, embrace it, relish it, treasure it, protect it; increase it, and display it to others.\nYou don\u2019t have to artificially create a community here to create an image to the people who come and see New Vraja Dhama. Just live as you are living and that will be the most powerful preaching you can possibly do!\nThis preaching can change the world. It\u2019s revolutionary! And this is what Srila Prabhupada came to start-- a revolution. You are all revolutionaries. Please, I beg you, don\u2019t change! Lead the charge, lead the world. Take over the world. Preach K\u00e5\u00f1\u00eba Consciousness as you are preaching now. And you will make Srila Sivarama Maharaja happy, Srila Prabhupada happy, and you will make Sri Sri Radha Syamasundara smile upon you every day in your life.\nHare Krsna\n","nid":"2524"},{

Canto 10, Ch.9, Text 20.\nnemam virinco na bhavo\nna sr\u00edr apy anga-samsraya\nprasadam lebhire gop\u00ed\nyat tat prapa vimuktitad\nna- not; imam-this exalted position; virincah-Lord Brahma; na-nor; bhavah-Lord Siva; na-nor; sr\u00edh- the goddess of fortune; api- indeed; anga-samsraya- although she is always the better half of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; prasadam-mercy; lebhire- obtained; gop\u00ed- mother Yasoda; yat tat- as that which; prapa-obtained; vimukti-dat- from Krishna, who gives deliverance from this material world\nTRANSLATION\nNeither Lord Brahma, nor Lord Siva, nor even the goddess of fortune, who is always the better half of the Supreme Lord, can obtain from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the deliverer from the material world, such mercy as received by mother Yasoda.\nPURPORT\nThis is a comparative study between mother Yasoda and other devotees of the Lord. As stated in Caitanya-cariamrita (Adi 5.142), ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: the only supreme master is Krishna, and all others are His servants. Krishna has the transcendental quality of bhrtya-vasyata, becoming subordinate to His bhrtya, or servant. Now, although everyone is bhrtya, and although Krishna has the quality of becoming subordinate to His bhrtya, the position of mother Yasoda is the greatest. Lord Brahma is bhrtya, a servant of Krishna, and he is adi-kavi, the original creator of this universe (tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye). Nonetheless, even he could not obtain such mercy as mother Yasoda. As for Lord Siva, he is the topmost Vaisnava (vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh). What to speak of Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is the Lord\u2019s constant companion in service, since she always associates with His body. But even she could not get such mercy. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit was surprised, thinking, \"What did mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja do in their previous lives by which they got such a great opportunity, the opportunity to be the affectionate father and mother of Krishna?\"\nIn this verse there are three negative pronouncements- na, na, na. When anything is uttered three times- \"do it, do it, do it\"- one should understand that this is meant to indicate great stress on a fact. In this verse we find na lebhire, na lebhire, na lebhire. Yet mother Yasoda is in the supermost exalted position, and thus Krishna has become completely subordinate to her.\nThe word vimuktidat is also significant. There are different types of liberation, such as sayujya, salokya, sarupya, sarsti and sam\u00edpya, but vimukti means \u2019special mukti\u2019. When after liberation one is situated on the platform of prema-bhakti, one is said to have achieved vimukti, \u02ddspecial mukti\u02dd. Therefore the word na is mentioned. That exalted platform of prema is described by Sr\u00ed Caitanya Mahaprabhu as prema pum-artho mahan, and mother Yasoda naturally acts in such an exalted position in loving affairs. She is therefore a nitya-siddha devotee, an expansion of Krishna\u2019s hladini potency, His potency to enjoy transcendental bliss through expansions who are special devotees (ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhih). Such devotees are not sadhana-siddha.\nPrabhupada explains in the commentary that this is a comparative study between mother Yasoda and other devotees. He quotes from Caitanya-caritamrita, ekela-isvara-krsna ara-saba-bhrtya, that only Krishna is the master, and all others are His servants. Therefore we can understand that Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the goddess of fortune, they are also servants. Of course the verse quoted describes that all living entities are His servants, though unfortunately not everyone realises that. But even among those who do realise it and engage in Krishna\u2019s service, there are comparative degrees of the way Krishna reciprocates with them.\nKrishna says ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham, \"as they surrender to Me, I will award them accordingly\". So in this way Krishna reciprocates according to one\u2019s attitude of surrender.\nPrabhupada explains in one commentary in the First Canto of the Bhagavatam about the way the Lord reciprocates. He quotes the well-known verse from the Bhagavad-gita describing the four types of persons who approach the Lord\u2014 those who are distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are inquisitive, and those who are wise. Those who want relief from distress, they are partial recipients of Krishna\u2019s mercy. Those who are inquisitive, they are also partial recipients. But those who fully surrendered themselves to the Supreme Lord, giving their body, mind, and words in the service of the Lord, they can be full recipients of the mercy of the Lord. And even from among those who are full recipients of the mercy of the Lord, as we see here, in the comparative study described in this verse, they also receive different degrees of mercy.\nIn this verse Mother Yasoda appears to be the greatest recipient of mercy. Therefore in the previous chapter, Pariksit Maharaja naturally inquired what was it that she did to get this mercy.\nIn other words when we see somebody getting so much mercy, we naturally want to know, how do I get that kind of mercy. Just like we explained last night, when a devotee sees another devotee receiving the Lord's mercy, the devotee is very happy to see this. They may then naturally think, \"What can I do to achieve such mercy.\"\nSo Pariksit Maharaja asked that question in the previous chapter, and he asked, \"What past auspicious activities did mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja perform to achieve such perfection and ecstatic love?\" He said that, \"Vasudeva and Devaki, they were also parents of Krishna, but they could not enjoy Krishna\u2019s childhood pastimes in the same way as Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja.\"\nSo Sukadeva Goswami responded to this question, \"To follow the orders of Lord Brahma, Drona, the best of the Vasus along with his wife, Dhara spoke to Lord Brahma in this way.\" In other words he is giving reference that previously Nanda and Yasoda appeared as Drona and Dhara. In the Brahma-vaivarta Purana it is described that they performed severe austerities in order to get Krishna as their son. They drank only water, then took only leaves, and then even more austerites than that, they were only taking air. They performed austerities for thousands of years. Lord Brahma came, pleased to give them a benediction by dint of their austerities.\nThey asked, \"Please promise us to be born on the planet Earth, so that after the appearance of the Supreme Lord we will also appear and do some devotional service.\" Brahma said \"Let it be so.\" Then Drona and Dhara appeared in Vrindavana as Nanda Maharaja and mother Yasoda.\nSo this is described in the Eighth Chapter of the Tenth Canto. In the Ninth Chapter, in the verse that we\u2019ve just read, it is described that mother Yasoda is an eternal associate of the Lord, and therefore we have to understand, that as it is explained by Srila Jiva Goswami also, this Drona and Dhara, who appeared and performed these austerities were actually amsa-avataras, or partial expansions of Nanda and Yasoda in the spiritual world.\nThat\u2019s why Prabhupada concludes his commentary of this verse by explaining that Yasoda is not sadhana-siddha. She is a nitya-siddha devotee. She is an eternal associate of the Lord. She always has that affection and relationship with Krishna, as Krishna\u2019s mother. That parental affection is always there in her heart. It is not that she was some demigod before, who performed some austerities, and then was able to achieve the position of Yasoda.\nIt is described, in Brhad Bhagavatmrta that the residents of the spiritual world, Goloka, descend in order to participate in the Lord\u2019s pastimes and to assist the Lord in His pastimes. Therefore such residents of the spiritual world may sometimes manifest partial expansions. Just as the Lord descends and accepts incarnations to fulfill His purpose, the residents of the spiritual world also similarly descend.\nThe following examples are given. Lord Balarama is eternally situated in the spiritual world, but he appears in Vaikuntha as Ananta Sesa. He also appears as Ananta Sesa in the planets of the demigods and then He again appears in this world as Lord Balarama, the original Personality of Godhead. Vasudeva and Devaki are in the spiritual world. They appear in Vaikuntha as Prsni and Sutalpa. They appear among the demigods as Aditi and Kasyapa and they also appear in this world as Vasudeva and Devaki. The example is also given of Sridama. Sridama is the eternal associate of the Lord in the spiritual world but he also appears in Vaikuntha as Garuda. He appears among the demigods as the son of Vinata, or Garuda once again. But he appears also in this world as Sridama again, that same personality. He is manifested in different places to fulfill the desires of the Lord.\nIn Brhad Bhagavatamrta the word that's used is counterparts, because they can manifest simultaneously in different places in order to satisfy their own desires and to fulfill the purposes of the Lord.\nTherefore Srila Jiva Goswami explains that we should not think that Drona and Dhara achieved the position of Krishna\u2019s parents by the boon of Lord Brahma. In fact he says how could Lord Brahma even give such a boon? Lord Brahma is in a much lower position. How can he give a boon or a benediction which is greater than that which he himself has achieved? When Lord Brahma prayed for a benediction, he prayed to achieve a position in Vrindavana, but as a blade of grass. But look what mother Yasoda achieved.\nSo Lord Brahma did not have the capacity to give such a benediction to become Krishna\u2019s mother. Therefore we can understand that it\u2019s on the pretense of this benediction that they achieved this exalted position. But it is also meant to help us understand that one has to be prepared to undergo great difficulties and austerities if one wants to achieve such mercy as that which was achieved by mother Yasoda.\nThere is another interesting word that is used in this verse\u2014prasadam, or mercy. Everyone is fully aware of that word and it\u2019s meaning, mercy. But it is described that Mother Yasoda has achieved, the word here is vimukti, which Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes as visesa mukti, special mukti, or special type of liberation. That special mukti is that she held the position of prema, pure love, unalloyed love. It is not simply mukti, or liberation. So she achieved this prema, unalloyed love and by the mercy of the Lord.\nIt also described by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura in the previous verse, which was possibly explained by Bhakti Vijnana Maharaja, [unforunately I was not here for his class] how mother Yasoda was able to bind Krishna. One of the factors that caused Krishna to be bound was her parisrama. Parisrama means \"hard labor\".\nIt's interesting also that this word is used in different references. It\u2019s used in the context of mother Yasoda\u2019s hard labor in her attempt to bind Krishna, and Prabhupada also talks about this word parisrama in reference to the word pavarga. Pavarga means \"material life\". The opposite of material life is apavarga. Apavarga means \"liberation\".\nSrila Prabhupada breaks down this word pavarga into five syllables, pa, pha, ba, bha, and ma. He says the first pa is parisrama. Material life has five different types of activities. The first is parisrama, \"hard labor\". Then there is phena, which is \"foaming of the mouth\"\u2014just like the horse. When the horse works very hard, the foam starts coming from his mouth. After hard work then there is ba, which means byarthata, \"disappointment\". We work so hard, but then we are disappointed with the result, the fruit of our hard labour. Pa, pha, ba, bha, which represents bhaya, \"fear\". The nature of material life is material suffering. We work very hard, we foam at the mouth, we become disappointed, and then we become afraid. What is the ultimate result of all that hard labour? Ma, mrtyu. \"Death\".\nSo the word parisrama used in that context describes how hard labour results in ultimately anxiety, fear, disappointment, and death. So apavarga means \"liberation\" or freedom from these five types of sufferings.\nSo it is interesting to take note here in this verse that mother Yasoda achieved a special type of liberation. The word is vimukti, or visesa-mukti. She received a special type of liberation which is that she achieved the position of prema, unalloyed love for the Lord by which the Lord reciprocated and became her son. Or as Prabhupada explained in the earlier part of today's commentary, bhrtya vasyata. This is a transcendental quality of the Supreme Lord\u2014that He becomes bound by the devotee\u2019s love.\nKrishna fully reciprocated with mother Yasoda\u2019s endeavors, big endeavors. But the results of her parisrama was not quite the same as the result of the other parisrama or the hard labor of those performed in material life.\nVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives an example in his commentary to this previous verse and therefore, as I said, I don\u2019t know, maybe Bhakti Vijnana Maharaja discussed this commentary, how the Supreme Lord had the desire that He wanted to continue His daily duties. He wanted to steal yoghurt and He didn\u2019t want to be tied up by the ropes of mother Yasoda. Therefore when mother Yasoda, took the rope to bind her son, two potencies of the Lord manifested within Him. They were His vibhuti-shakti and His satya-sankalpa-shakti. The vibhuti-shakti displayed the Lord's opulences, which was that the Lord could not be bound with the ropes, even though mother Yasoda made so many attempts to bind Krishna. She took so many ropes but still it was always two fingers too short. And the satya-sankalpa-shakti is the potency of the Lord which fulfills all His desires. In other words the Lord\u2019s desires are always fulfilled, but sometimes we see when there is competition between the Lord and the devotee of the Lord, then even though the Lord has His desires, due to the devotee\u2019s determination, his will prevails and the Lord is defeated by the devotee\u2019s desire.\nSo how is it that Krishna became defeated by mother Yasoda? And how is it that this mercy of the Lord which melts the heart of the Lord, and which is known as the king of all the Lord\u2019s qualities, manifested. Mother Yasoda did something to awaken that mercy. Of course her life is an exhibition of mercy. But in this particular pastime what is it that Mother Yasoda did that awakened this mercy in Krishna that made His heart melt like soft butter? The word that is used is this word, parisrama. It was her hard labor. And the other factor was Krishna\u2019s kripa-shakti. When this mercy, kripa-shakti, manifested, then the satya-sankalpa-shakti and the vibhuti-shakti, just left Krishna's body.\nAlthough His potencies were there, which means that whatever desire Krishna has will be fulfilled by His satya-sankalpa-shakti, because of mother Yasoda\u2019s hard labor the satya-sankalpa-shakti left, and the vibhuti-shakti left. The vibhuti-shakti was that potency which was manifested by mother Yasoda\u2019s inability to get those two ropes tied together. She was so determined by her efforts to tie up her son, that she even requested all the other cowherd ladies to go to their homes and to get whatever ropes they could find in the whole village so she could add them to the already existing rope and tie up her son.\nAll the cowherd women even said to her, \"Yasoda, why are you doing this? Can\u2019t you see? It seems like your son has good fortune today. He is not going to be bound up by you.\" And mother Yasoda\u2019s response to that was, \"Just bring all the other ropes. Anything you can find in the village. Even if I add these ropes all day long until evening, I want to find out the extent of my son\u2019s waist. Just bring them all. I want to see.\" That was mother Yasoda\u2019s determination.\nSo when Krishna saw this determination in mother Yasoda, this mercy manifested from His heart and His heart melted like butter. Satya-sankalpa left. The vibhuti-shakti left and that distance of two fingers was completely removed by the hard labor of mother Yasoda and by Krishna\u2019s mercy.\nSo first, the distance of two fingers was removed. And then what was the actual cause for the Lord to be bound? Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes that it was bhakta-nistha. What is this bhakta-nistha? Bhakta \u2013nistha was the determination\u2014nistha also means conviction\u2014the determination of the devotee in his tireless endeavors. When a devotee is so determined that he is ready to do anything necessary, then by such great endeavor what happens? the Lord manifests His sva-nistha. Both of these principles cause the Lord to be bound. What is this sva-nistha? That is this consistent quality of the Lord. The consistent quality of the Lord is that He is defeated by His devotees. The Lord always reciprocates fully with those who desire to please Him according to their particular relationship they have with the Lord.\nTherefore Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura speaks about this hard labor. He says when Krishna sees two things, hard labor, or parisrama, and when He sees fatigue, that the devotee is becoming so tired from his hard labor.\nTherefore we see quite a different result from parisrama in this instance than the parisrama we described previously in reference to the word pavarga.\nSo we should never think that hard labor or an intense endeavor is not required. We see that in the material world there is intense endevour. So many materialists are engaged in very intense endeavor which brings foam of the mouth, which brings disappointment, which brings fear, and which ultimately results in their death. How is it that mother Yasoda received such mercy that Pariksit Maharaja was inquiring about it? Such mercy that even Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, and the goddess of fortune did not achieve.\nIn this particular pastime we see that mother Yasoda achieved that mercy, Krsna's svanistha, that bhrtya-vasyata, by her hard labor. The Lord reciprocates according to the devotee\u2019s attitude and determination, and He allows Himself to be conquered by the desire of the devotee.\nIn a previous commentary Prabhupada explains that it's not that Krishna is controlled by the devotee, but Krishna is controlled by the love of His devotee. According to that particular type of love the devotee has for the Lord, the Lord reciprocates. So those who have parental affection towards Krishna, as mother Yasoda has, Krishna reciprocates with their love and He bestows His full mercy by allowing Himself to be defeated by that love. That mercy is achieved only by the residents of Vrindavana. Only they have that quality, that characteristic of such complete mercy that Mother Yasoda simply thinks of Krishna as her begotten son.\nAlthough the Supreme Lord may be worshipped like the demigods like Indra and the other demigods by those who studied the three Vedas, or although He may be worshipped by those who study the Upanisads, as the impersonal feature of the Lord, and though He may be worshipped as Purusa by those who analytically study this world, and although He may be worshipped and percieved as the Supersoul by those who are engaged in austerities and penances by great yogis, and although He may be percieved and worshipped as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, still mother Yasoda thinks, \"Krishna is my son.\"\nEveryone else has their particular understanding of the Supreme Lord. But what is Mother Yasoda\u2019s understanding? \"Krishna is my son.\" Try to change that. It\u2019s indelible. It cannot be changed. It is an eternally manifested affection that is always there in her heart. And those who are attracted to such affection, they should think of Mother Yasoda's love for Krishna.\nPrabhupada even explains that in this chapter. In the third verse to this chapter, there is verse which gives a description of Mother Yasoda.\n[Reads the verse]\n\"Dressed in a saffron-yellow sari, with a belt tied about her full hips, mother Ya\u00e7od\u00e4 pulled on the churning rope, laboring considerably, her bangles and earrings moving and vibrating and her whole body shaking. Because of her intense love for her child, her breasts were wet with milk. Her face, with its very beautiful eyebrows, was wet with perspiration, and m\u00e4lat\u00e9 flowers were falling from her hair.\" (SB 10.9.3)\nPrabhupada explains in his commentary that \"advanced devotees should cherish this description, always thinking of mother Yasoda\u2019s features, how she was dressed, how she was working, perspiring, how beautifully the flowers were arranged in her hair, and so on. One should take advantage of the full description provided here by thinking of mother Yasoda in her maternal affection for Krishna.\"\nSo mother Yasoda is an eternal associate of the Lord and she always displays her constant meditation on Krishna. She is always engaged in serving her son, thinking about her son, preparing milk products for her son, singing songs and poems in glorification of her son as she is churning the butter. While mother Yasoda is churning butter, she is reciting different verses in glorification of her son\u2014always thinking of the wonderful things her son does. But although Krishna is doing so many wonderful things, mother Yasoda\u2019s indelible thoughts of her son, is always as her son.\nEven when Krishna is returning from the pasturing grounds and the demigods are showering flowers on Him, mother Yasoda is thinking, \"Oh just see how wonderful my son is.\" She doesn't think, \"Why are the demigods showering flowers?\" She thinks, \"How wonderful my son is. Even the demigods are showering flowers on Him.\"\nThe example is given that a mother, even if her son may be the president, but still, in her mind, he is her son. So that\u2019s how mother Yasoda always thinks of Krishna. And Krishna reciprocates with His full mercy upon her, and Krishna also reciprocates with His full mercy upon those devotees who meditate on His pastimes with great determination. This is also hard labor. It\u2019s not such an easy thing. But if we have great determination, and we are always trying to remember the Lord, to hear these glories of the Lord, especially to hear the descriptions and narrations of His pastimes in the spiritual world, then the Lord can be conquered although He is otherwise unconquerable by anybody in this world.\nThis is confirmed by Lord Brahma in the Srimad Bhagavatam, that those who dedicate their lives to these transcendental narrations, which are vibrated by the Lord and vibrated by the Lord\u2019s devotees, they will certainly conquer the Lord, although He is unconquerable by anyone in the three worlds.\nSo let us display such parisrama. Let this be our hard labor. The Lord will always be defeated and will display His mercy upon us, in the same way as He bestowed His mercy upon His mother Yasoda.\nThank you very much.\nHare Krishna.\n","nid":"2188"},{
"title":"Transcription of \"Preaching with Compassion\" - Class Three - July 30th Lecture at Baltics Festival","ref":"","attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Preaching","Baltics Festival"],"date":"Fri, 2010-08-13 04:57","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially-edited transcript of a lecture given at the \"Baltics Festival\" on July 30th, 2010:\n \n Over the past few days I\u2019ve been speaking on the subject of preaching. I understand that not all of you took part in our presentation yesterday. But yesterday, although it was a meeting with disciples, we continued on the same topic I began with on the first day.\nThe first day we were speaking about the importance of preaching as a service to Srila Prabhupada in our sampradaya, and specifically on the topic of preaching with compassion. We gave some of the characteristics of what is compassion by describing the Lord's compassionate nature.\nAlthough the Lord is unapproachable, He nonetheless makes Himself accessible through the mercy of His devotee. We also discussed the Lord\u2019s nature, that when something is offered to Him with affection, then the Lord is very much inclined to take what may externally appear to be a very small offering and magnify it into something very great. We gave the example of Sudama Vipra, how he offered a few grains of broken rice but the Lord was still very eager to accept it. He considered those few grains of broken rice even superior to any benediction He could possibly offer in return.\nSo the Lord does not see the external offering but sees the intention of the heart. Therefore when we offer something with the aim of pleasing the Lord, or pleasing the servant of the Lord, then the Lord is very much inclined to accept that offering. It is a way to capture His attention.\nWe oftentimes quote the verse spoken by Prahlada Maharaja in this connection, when he was speaking to his classmates. He said, \"You cannot please the Supreme Personality of Godhead even if you become expert brahmanas, or if you're advanced in vast learning, nor by austerities, by accepting vows or great sacrifices, and neither by chastity. None of these qualities can awaken the pleasure of the Lord. The Lord is pleased only when one has unflinching unalloyed devotional service to Him. Without sincere devotional service anthing else is simply a show.\"\nSo Prahlada Maharaja explains the criteria for getting the Lord\u2019s attention. Even austerities, great sacrifices and vows are not adequate, because the Lord does not look at externals. These things cannot interest Him in the least. Why should He be interesed in such things when He is the possessor of all of those things\u2013to the ultimate degree? So what captures the Lord\u2019s attention is the affection, the love that one has, or the intention behind our offering.\nTherefore Prahlada Maharaja concludes by saying that without sincere devotional service, anything else one does is simply a show. The word \"show\" means that if it\u2019s not going to get Krishna\u2019s attention then one must be doing it to get somebody else\u2019s attention. Krishna is not interested. His attention is always someplace else. As much as one may try to capture His attention by one's show, He is not interested in the performance. One may get somebody else\u2019s attention, and one may feel some sense of reciprocation from obtaining that attention, but that won\u2019t satisfy the self, and neither will it please the Lord\u2014unless of course one obtains the attention of the Lord\u2019s unalloyed devotee. But to obtain that also is not an external affair, because the devotee of the Lord\u2019s primary interest is, as we spoke about the other day, to awaken the Krishna Consciousness in the hearts of others. The devotee becomes very pleased when he sees a person advancing in Krishna Consciousness.\nThe devotee is very compassionate. If a person offers something sincerely and with affection, even though it may appear to be very small, a devotee is very eager to accept it. The example that Visnujana Maharaja gave was the person who comes to the temple for the first time and offers to clean the floor. Because he is offering to do some service for Krishna, a devotee should be very eager to accept it. We should think, \"He is a new person Krishna has sent to the temple.\" There may be so many other abominable activities in his life, but all that we should see is that he wants to clean Krishna\u2019s floor.\nSo a sincere desire to do something for Krishna should be recognized. And by the mercy of a pure devotee, if that devotee recognizes somebody\u2019s sincere intention, then the Lord will also recognize. Visnujana Maharaja gave the example of how the spiritual master\u2014he was speaking about Srila Prabhupada\u2014is a representative of Srimati Radharani, who is the embodiment of the Lord\u2019s compassionate nature. By Her mercy we are able to offer something to the Lord. If She recommends, the Lord will always accept. Therefore She is the embodiment of compassion.\nWe also gave the example of how Radharani\u2019s pleasure increases ten million times by bringing others forward in their relationship with Krishna.\nSo we spoke about this compassionate preaching on the first day and the importance of dedicating ourselves to Srila Prabhupada\u2019s desire that his followers preach and distribute his books as the means for pleasing him. Preaching means to preach both to the nondevotees and the devotees.\nYesterday, for those who are new to this seminar, we spoke more about preaching to devotees and we spoke about the importance of overlooking shortcomings in devotees. In order to be an effective preacher we have to be able to overlook other's shortcomings in order to focus on their good qualities. We should also try to inspire them to make progress in devotional service\u2014to give up whatever faults or bad qualities there may be there in their heart\u2014 but not by necessarily pointing out their bad qualities or faults.\nIn fact one devotee asked the question, \"Are we supposed to always overlook others' faults and not take them into consideration when we are preaching to other devotees?\" \nThere are examples in our Vaisnava line of devotees who are adosha darshi . Adosa darshi means \"to see without faults.\" Those who are adosha darshi, whoever they see, they simply don\u2019t see their faults. They see only good qualities. \nKrishnadasa Kaviraja Goswami wrote about one Vaisnava who was a disciple of Ananta Acarya whose name was Haridasa Pandita. He was adosha darshi. It is not that he had to deliberately make some effort to not look at their faults. He just didn\u2019t see them. He only saw their good qualities.\nIn the commentary Prabhupada explains that a Vaisnava, by nature, is like a bee who is always looking for honey, whereas the faultfinder is like a fly who is always looking for the sore.\nThere are also examples in Caitanya Caritamrita of faultfinders. Among the many disciples of Madhavendra Puri, two prominent ones mentioned in the Caitanya Caritamrita were Isvara Puri and Ramacandra Puri.\nRamacandra Puri was given as the example of a faultfinder. He even found fault in Lord Caitanya. He accused the Lord of eating sweets at night when he saw ants on the floor in the Lord's room. He also found fault with his own spiritual master, Madhavendra Puri. As Madhavendra Puri was preparing to depart from this world, he was reciting a verse in the mood of Srimati Radharani's feelings of separation from Krishna. Hearing the recitation of that verse, Ramacandra Puri asked \"Why are you lamenting? You shouldn\u2019t be lamenting like this. One who is fixed in Brahman, does not lament, na socati na kanksati. He has no lamentation.\"\nRamacandra Puri couldn\u2019t understand the spiritual emotions which his spiritual master was experiencing in separation from Krishna. Madhavendra Puri told Ramacandra Puri, \"Get out of my sight! If I give up my body seeing your face, then certainly I will not reach my desired destination.\"\nSo we see there are examples of faultfinders also in Caitanya Caritamrita. In the presence of Madhavendra Puri, such an exalted acarya in our disciplic succession, his own disciple was finding fault with him. So that is like a fly that goes to the sore.\nBut by nature the devotee is supposed to be adosa darshi, which means that he is not interested in looking for the faults, even if faults may be there.\nIn fact, we are going to read tonight from one letter that we thought would be a good continuation on this topic, where Prabhupada describes that there will always be some fault in this material world. Prabhupada writes here that even in the spiritual world there is some fault.\nWe might be wondering how such a statement could be made. But please remember this point because you will hear it explained in this leter. Rather than addressing it now, I\u2019ll wait until Srila Prabhupada addresses it in his letter. So make sure that you\u2019ve had that point answered clearly in your minds so it is not misunderstood. \nWe\u2019ll give now one of the examples Prabhupada used. He said just like when Krishna saw Radharani, He became so bewildered by Radharani\u2019s beauty, that instead of milking a cow He began milking a bull. So Prabhupada used that as one example. \nThe other example he uses are the gopis. But we will get there. We will read it. The point is that there will always be some fault. \nThe devotee, however, is not interested in looking at faults\u2014especially those who are preachers. They may see faults. They may see people engaged in improper behaviour. But a preacher also has to be able to see the potential for devotional service in everyone. Without seeing the potential for devotional service in the heart of every living being, it\u2019s difficult to successfully preach.\nEvery living entity has a potential for devotional service. But if all we see instead is their faults, then how can we fan that spark? How can we increase that potential into something much greater?\nTherefore a preacher has to be able to see that everyone has the potential to engage in devotional service, and everyone has the potential to love Krishna.\nnitya-siddha krsna-prema \u2018sadhya' kabhu naya\nsravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya\n(Caitanya Caritamrita, Madhya 22, Verse 107)\n\"Pure love for Krsna is eternally established in the hearts of the living entities. It is not something to be gained from another source. When the heart is purified by hearing and chanting, this love naturally awakens.\"\nThat love is awakened by sravana, by hearing from the right source. Then that love will come out. It will be awakened from within the heart.\nSo that potential for devotional service is there in the heart of every living being. Therefore the preacher in Krishna Consciousness, when he sees that others are not advanced in devotional service, he feels compassion for them. He wants to fan the spark. He wants to create that inspiration within the heart to advance in devotional service and to voluntarily give up these unwanted attachments within the heart.\nDevotional service is a voluntarily process. In fact in one letter [a different letter, not this one] Srila Prabhupada explains how it's necessary for our managers and preachers to learn how to awaken the voluntarily spirit of surrender and sacrifice\u2014not to just awaken it\u2014but to keep it alive. This is very, very important. How to keep alive the voluntarily spirit\u2014that desire? \"I want to advance. I want to see what my anarthas are so that I can overcome them.\" \nWhen somebody has that desire awakened within his heart, that \"I want to advance, I want to overcome my obstacles in devotional service\", then when somebody with some realization speaks with compassion, then the person is very eager to hear it. \"Oh, yes, thank you so much!\" We feel gratitude. \"You are helping me. Thank you so much! You are helping me overcome these obstacles that are blocking me from loving Krishna and serving my spiritual master.\"\nSo that gratitude awakens within the heart because the desire is there, \"That\u2019s what I want. I want to become free from these obstacles.\" So that\u2019s why the voluntary spirit has to be continuously nourished, nurtured and inspired.\nPrabhupada was explaining in that letter that this is the responsibility of the preachers of Krishna Consciousness\u2014 to keep this voluntary spirit of sacrifice and surrender always fresh.\nSo the preachers of Krishna Consciousness\u2014and Srila Prabhupada in his books, lectures and letters, often says that the duty of every member of the Krishna Conscious movement is to preach\u2014have to develop this quality.\nTherefore when I am speaking about preachers, I\u2019m speaking to all of you sitting in this room. You all have the potential to give Krishna to others. Since you all have the potential for pure devotional service, then you have the potential to preach. But preaching must be done with compassion\u2014with the desire to instill that voluntary surrender and desire in others to give something to Krishna.\nThe preacher should be able to inspire others to voluntarily sacrifice their intelligence, their wealth, their words and their life\u2014prana, artha, dhiya, vaca. Often Prabhupada would quote this verse from the Tenth Canto when he talked about sacrifice. \n\"It is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the benefit of others with his life, wealth, intelligence and words.\" (SB 10.22.35)\nPrabhupada used this in reference to householders. He would say, \"If you can\u2019t give your words, then you can give your money. Or you can give your intelligence. Or some can give their words and preach. But whatever one voluntarily gives,\" he explains, \"one should give to the Krishna Consciousness movement. Then he will expand the glories of the Lord.\" \nSo preachers should awaken this voluntary desire in everyone to offer whatever they can for the service of the Lord. \nSo we said we wanted to read from a letter about faults. I have a lot of favorite letters from Srila Prabhupada, but this is definitely one of my most favorite letters.\nI was having a discussion the other day about Prabhupada\u2019s letters. I was saying that sometimes Srila Prabhupada's letters can be interpreted to mean something that was not really Prabhupada\u2019s intention. Srila Prabhupada\u2019s letters were used to address specific situations, whereas whatever he put in his books was meant for everyone.\nSo sometimes we can take his letters, and if we are not careful, we can use them to support a conclusion which may not necessarily be applicable. Of course that tendency can be there in many things that Prabhupada either said or wrote. \nI remember\u2014what year was it? Maybe 1975. Prabhupada wrote to one temple president that everybody in the whole temple should go out to do sankirtana and one devotee should stay back to worship the Deities. I believe the letter was to Sri Govinda dasa in Chicago. In those days our temples were quite full. I think we had in our Boston temple about 75 devotees at that time. In Chicago there was probably more.\nSo when Prabhupada wrote that, the word just went out to all of the temples, and before you knew it, all the temples were emptying out. Of course it was great. Everybody was going out to sell Srila Prabhupada's books and, in many temples, just one or a few devotees were staying back. \nTo this day I don't actually know if that was Srila Prabhupada\u2019s intention, that in every temple we had to send out all the devotees except one devotee who would stay back to worship the deities. But it happenned, at least, as I am aware\u2014in America. \nAnyways, in Prabhupada\u2019s letters some of his instructions can be misapplied. But in some letters, like this one, his instructions were just so clear.\nPrabhupada was specifically speaking about faults. So here he says:, \n\"I am very much pleased by the sentiments expressed therein. It is not so much that because there may be some faults in our godbrothers and godsisters, or because there may be some mismanagement or lack of cooperation, that this is due to being impersonalists, no. It is the nature of the living condition to always have some fault.\"\nSo, we can draw some conclusions here. Prabhupada seemed to be addressing a concern by this devotee that there was some tendencies toward impersonalism in the temple. Prabhupada is writing that because there is some faults, mismanagement, or lack of cooperation, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is impersonalism. \"Even in the spiritual world there is some fault and envy.\"\nOk, here it is:\n\"Sometimes the Gopis will quarrel over Krishna's favor, and once Krishna was so much attracted to Radharani that by mistake he tried to milk the bull instead of the cow, and sometimes when the Gopis used to put on their dress and make-up for seeing Krishna, they would be too much hasty and smear kumkum and mascara in the wrong places and their ornaments and dresses would appear as if small children had been trying to dress themselves and they were not very expert, like that. There are so many examples. But it is not the same as material fault or material envy, it is transcendental because it is all based on Krishna. Sometimes when one Gopi would serve Krishna very nicely, the others would say, Oh, she has done so nicely, now let me do better for pleasing Krishna. That is envy, but it is transcendental, without malice.\"\nThis is a very important point. It is envy. Actually the Nectar of Devotion gives different examples of envy. There is one example. One gopi was speaking to Radharani, because it appeared She had Krishna\u2019s favor. She was saying, \"Don\u2019t be so puffed up thinking that Krishna painted lines on your forehead, because I can see that He painted perfectly straight lines. Since He painted them perfectly, it means, He probably wasn\u2019t very agitated.\"\nRupa Goswami says this is an instance of envy of Radharani\u2019s favor. So there is envy in the spiritual world. But the difference between the spiritual world and the material world, is that in the envy of the material world, there is malice. In the spiritual world there is never malice.\nIn the material world the nature of an envious person is that he always wants to push others down. Just like somebody may get recognized by the spiritual master or he may get recognized by other Vaisnavas. Many devotees appear very pleased by this recognition. But if we feel envy in our heart towards that Vaisnava, then we might say, \"Oh, he didn\u2019t do that much.\" Immediately we make light of it. We want to make it look less.\nWe think, \"Why was he recognized and not me?\" Right? Prabhupada even talks about this in Caitanya Caritamrita when Rupa and Sanatana Goswami were recognized by Lord Caitanya. He accepted them, gave them initiation, and gave them their names Rupa and Sanatana. All the Vaisnavas present became joyful.\nIn the commentary Prabhupada said that this is the nature of a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava becomes joyful when he sees others receiving the mercy of the Lord. Those who are envious don\u2019t feel joy when they see others receiving mercy. Prabhupada also said in the same commentary that one should neglect persons who are envious, even though they may be dressed as Vaisnavas.\nSo the nature of a Vaisnava is that he is very happy to see others receive mercy. But if there is envy in the heart, then immediately we try to slight, or or demean the other person\u2019s recognition or success.\nOr we may think that progress in devotional service is based upon how we are recognized. If we're not recognized by the strength of our devotion, then we'll push others down so that we can stand out above them. We make them small or diminish their service so that the most important service appears as the service I do. Then we think that all the service they are doing is because of me. We think, \"Can\u2019t you see? I am the source of their service. Everything is emanating from me. The wise who know this perfectly, worship me with all of their hearts.\"\nNow that\u2019s envy. Whereas we described compassion as the opposite. Real compassion is free from envy, when everyone is encouraged to move forward and we stay in the background.\nRadharani\u2019s pleasure is ten million times greater when She is pushing everyone forward and she can stay in the background. How could she experience a pleasure ten million times greater unless Krishna is pleased? Her pleasure is based on Krishna\u2019s pleasure. So it is obvious that Krishna is pleased. Otherwise how could she experience such pleasure? That\u2019s what pleases Krishna\u2014being free from envy and always eager to see others come forward and to progress in devotional service. \nSo there is envy in the spiritual world, but there is no malice. So malice means that we want to see others hurt. If you want to read about the characteristics of malice, then read the bhajan of Bhaktivinode Thakura, Amara Jivana. Read the translation and then you'll read how Bhaktivinode Thakura is taking the position of a person who sees other\u2019s suffering as his own happiness. And when he sees others happy, he becomes disturbed. He is describing the mentality of a materialistic person. It is the complete opposite of Vaisnava mentality. But he helps us to look within ourselves, whatever tendencies there may be within ourselves, so that we can check them.\nTherefore such advanced Vaisnavas are very merciful. They help us by reflecting what\u2019s there within our own hearts. They act just like a mirror. The tendency is there in the hearts of those who are faultfinders to see faults in others which actually exist in ourselves. But it\u2019s easier to see the faults in everyone else. It is so much easier. I can say, \"I see it there and I see it there.\" But we can\u2019t look within and see that is actually within our own hearts.\nWe should know that if we look at others, simply seeing their faults or shortcomings, then something is missing in our hearts. If that\u2019s all we can see then the fault is there within our own hearts, because if all I can see is faults, I must be a faultfinder. If I can\u2019t see any good qualities, how can I help anybody? How can I preach?\nIn an Eleventh Canto purport of Srimad Bhagavatam, it states that such kanisthas, who see only the faults in others, are practically useless for preaching. We have to be able to see the potential for devotional service in everyone. If all we see are faults, then we have to look within our own hearts, and ask ourselves, \"Why am I only seeing faults? Maybe I should start my work here, with myself?\" \nSo in the presence of advanced Vaisnavas who are very merciful and compassionate, they can act like a mirror to show us what faults are in our own hearts. Otherwise we may not able to see them, especially if we selectively keep association with only those who help us to feel good about ourselves. Then we'll think we're practically perfect. \"I hear so much praise. I must not have faults. This makes me feel good.\" \nBut if we are in the association of devotees who will show us what's still in our hearts\u2014or even if they don't say anything, but in their presence we can still see our anarthas, we\u2019ll become afraid of them and we'll avoid them. We don\u2019t like to look at those anarthas. But if we are willing to look, to at least know what\u2019s there in our hearts, we can aspire to become free from them. We'll then chant more sincerely with the desire to become freed from these unwanted desires within our heart. We'll pray, \"Krishna, I can\u2019t remove these anarthas within my heart. I am powerless, and on my own strength I cannot possibly eradicate these unwanted desires within my heart. I\u2019m fully dependent on You.\"\nTherefore we should seek out the association of devotees who can help us overcome these unwanted attachments which are weighing us down, preventing us from advancing in devotional service. Every devotee should have somebody he can go to, who can tell him or her something about themselves that they can accept and digest. That desire should be awakened in our hearts so that we can advance.\nOtherwise we will think, \"Why am I not advancing?\" \"We will begin blaming the process of Krishna Consciousness. \"It\u2019s not working. I am not making advancement.\" We\u2019ll begin to think that there is something wrong with Krishna Consciousness.\nThere is never anything wrong with Krishna Consciousness. Krishna Consciousness is perfect. It has no fault. Although Prabhupada said even in the spiritual world there is some fault. But this was in a different context. In Krishna Consciousness there is no fault. Krishna always sees the intention of His devotee. He sees if the devotee is trying to do something to please Him. That's what He wants to see most. \nEven if externally, it appears someone makes a mistake, Krishna will not see that mistake. Svalpam apyasya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat. \"In this endeavor there is never any loss, and a little advancement in this path protects one from the most dangerous type of fear.\"\nSo if we sincerely desire to do something to please the devotee, or to please the Lord, then whatever mistake may externally appear to be there will ultimately be rectified by Krishna.\nPrabhupada explains that a little bit in one commentary in the Third Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam. When Lord Brahma is praying for the potency to create the universe, he was praying, \"How can I create the universe and not become entangled in it?\"\nWe may build a piece of furniture or build a house, and we immediately think, \"I did it. I created it. It\u2019s mine.\" Lord Brahma has to create a whole universe. So he is praying, \"How do I create a whole universe and not become entangled?\"\nPrabhupada explained in the commentary, \"Fortunate is that person who is entrusted with responsible work. If he is always conscious that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord, then whatever result comes from his effort, will be the right result.\" Such a devotee is always thinking himself to be an instrument, not a proprietor, not the enjoyer, and not the controller. \nKrishna says, \"In all activities just depend upon Me and work under My protection. In such devotional service become fully conscious of Me. If you become conscious of Me you can cross upon all the obstacles of conditional life by My grace. But if you do not act in such a consciousness and instead act through false ego not hearing Me, you will be lost.\"\nSo Krishna is very clearly saying, \"If you are conscious of Me, all obstacles will be overcome.\" Or it could also be said, all faults will be eradicated.\nSo Prahupada is saying that is the same principle for Lord Brahma. If you are always conscious about being subordinate to the Lord, then the result will always be right. But if we forget and act through false ego, even though the result may look very nice from an external point of view, it is not right. Therefore the consciousness is what Krishna sees. So we have to perform our activities in that proper consciousness. \nSo I want to finish this letter. It\u2019s already past to 8:30 and there is a little bit more to this letter. So we left off speaking about envy without malice. \n\"So we shall not expect that anywhere there is any Utopia. Rather, that is impersonalism. People should not expect that even in the Krishna Consciousness Society there will be Utopia. Because devotees are persons, therefore there will always be some lacking -- but the difference is that their lacking, because they have given up everything to serve Krishna -- money, jobs, reputation, wealth, big educations, everything -- their lackings have become transcendental because, despite everything they may do, their topmost intention is to serve Krishna. \"One who is engaged in devotional service, despite the most abominable action, is to be considered saintly because he is rightly situated.'' The devotees of Krishna are the most exalted persons on this planet, better than kings, all of them, so we should always remember that and, like the bumblebee, always look for the nectar or the best qualities of a person. Not like the utopians, who are like the flies who always go to the open sores or find the faults in a person, and because they cannot find any utopia, or because they cannot find anyone without faults, they want to become void, merge, nothing -- they think that is utopia, to become void of personality. So if there is sometimes slight disagreements between devotees, it is not due to impersonalism, but it is because they are persons, and such disagreements should not be taken very seriously. The devotee is always pessimistic about the material world, but he is very optimistic about the spiritual life; so in this way, you should consider that anyone engaged in Krishna's service is always the best person.\nI am very pleased that you are assisting your godbrothers so nicely. Yes, this is our real position, to be servants of the servants of the servants. And by your quiet and humble attitude, you shall set the example of Vaisnava so that all may learn from you, and very soon their puffed-up attitude will disappear and they will come to you and seek your advice in matters.\"\nI think we can stop there. Let Prabhupada conclude this presentation.\nThank you very much.\nHare Krishna.\n\n","nid":"2139"},{
"title":"Transcription of Caitanya Caritamrita Lecture - June 20, 2010 - \"How the Lord Tests His Devotees\"","ref":{"target_id":"1865"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Gaura Lila","NVD"],"date":"Mon, 2010-06-21 13:03","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially-edited transcript of yesterday's Caitanya Caritamrita Lecture, Madhya Lila, Chapter Four, Verses 187-189\nMadhya 4.187\n\"Sri Gopala wanted to show how intensely Madhavendra Puri loved Krsna; therefore He asked him to go to Nilacala to fetch sandalwood and camphor.\nMadhya 4.188\n\"With great trouble and after much labor, Madhavendra Puri brought the load of sandalwood to Remuna. However, he was still very pleased; he discounted all the difficulties.\nMadhya 4.189\n\"To test the intense love of Madhavendra Puri, Gopala, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ordered him to bring sandalwood from Nilacala, and when Madhavendra Puri passed this examination, the Lord became very merciful to him.\n\nSo in this section of this chapter we see how Madhavendra Puri is selflessly serving his worshipful Deity by following His request to go and to collect sandalwood and camphor for Him, even though such a request was an extreme inconvenience and test (as described in this verse). Nonetheless Madhavendra Puri passed the test with flying colors (as they say in English). Is there such an expression in Hungarian. No? It's a popular expression in English. \"He passed the test with flying colors.\" Flying colors means that it was a grand success. Just like when there's fireworks, there is a celebration. They are flying colors. It is meant to celebrate something very auspicious.\nSo Madhavendra Puri's successful execution of the test given to him by Gopal was a cause for celebration for everyone. Certainly it was a cause of celebration for all Vaisnavas, because that example is something which is very dear to their hearts. The Lord will sometimes test His devotee for the benefit of all living beings throughout creation. When the Lord tests the devotee, everyone benefits. The devotee who is tested benefits because as a result of passing that test, his attachment for the Lord is intensified. The Lord's pleasure increases, because the Lord becomes very pleased by the selfless service of His devotee. He is so pleased by that service that the Lord wants to give him something in exchange\u2014 always a most valuable treasure.\nWe can cite some examples how the Lord always gives something back to the devotee who sacrifices for Him because He wants to do something to reciprocate that selfless love. Such activities of the Lord also increases His own pleasure because that's how the Lord derives His pleasure\u2014 by reciprocating with His devotees and by serving His devotees. The Lord doesn't derive the same pleasure from being a master. He derives His pleasure by becoming subservient to the desires of His devotees, which is the essense of rasa, or one's eternal relationship between the Lord and His pure devotee.\nSo the devotee's attachment is intensified and his pleasure is increased and the Lord's attachment is intensified and His pleasure is increased. Also all Vaisnavas who hear about these pastimes, their attachment and love is intensified and increased. So everyone benefits when the Lord tests His devotees.\nBut envious persons may not benefit. They may say, \"Oh what kind of Lord puts His devotee in a difficult situation unless He wants to see His devotee suffer! I don't want to serve such a Lord as that. And not only that, His only purpose is just to test him. What kind of love is that? Testing? Deriving pleasure by putting somebody into suffering just to test him? What is the purpose behind that? Why does he have to that? What does he get out of that? What pleasure does he possibly get by putting somebody He loves into difficulty?\" But that's how people who have a materialistic conception of life think.\nIn the material world everyone is testing the fidelity of their so-called lovers. Why do they test them? Because they don't trust them. So they have to test to make sure. \"Is my lover really loyal to me?\" This goes on constantly in the material world. In fact they have all kinds of tests that they do. You can look on the internet for \"fidelity testing.\" There will be many agents who provide fidelity testing services. They can send a secret message to someone's lover, asking about their loyalty to their spouse, and make them think that it's anonymous. The so-called anonymous survey goes back to the company and then goes back to the person who ordered the test. You don't have to do research. Take my word for it. It's there.\nBut that's just one example. Sometimes in relationships between husband and wife, the husband will test to see how far the wife will go. And the wife will test to see how far her husband will go to do something to please her. Why do they do that? They do that because they have some doubt. And they need reinforcement. They need security. \"I need to feel secure in this relationship. But I have these doubts. So I have to pull out these little tests to make sure I'm secure.\" Then the tested spouse gets angry. \"You doubt me? You mean it was only a test? I've had enough of these tests. Haven't I proved it to you yet? Why are you testing me again? I've had enough of this.\" Just see. So-called fidelity. And the whole material world is revolving on such a mentality. Everybody is testing each other to make sure that their relationships are secure.\nSo when they hear that God also tests, then, \"atmavan manyate jagat.\" Atmavan manyate jagat means that I project my own mentality on to everyone and everything else. Prabhupada gives the example, \"If I wear blue-tinted glasses then I say the whole world is blue. That's how I see the world. So that's how the world is.\" But it's a distorted perception of reality. So he thinks that when the Supreme Lord tests His devotee it's because the Lord has doubts about the devotee's loyalty and needing security, He therefore tests. \"What kind of God is this?\", they think.\nThey don't understand that the Lord tests to glorify His devotee. He derives great pleasure by seeing how His devotee is glorified. The Lord recognizes His devotee. In fact, the Lord already recognized His devotee by testing him. If the devotee understands this then his spiritual life can be successful. \"If I'm being tested by the Lord, I've already been recognized. What shelter. What happiness there is in knowing that the Lord has taken notice of me. How auspicious to be tested by the Supreme Lord!\" It means that you have already been recognized. That's how a devotee thinks. He doesn't doubt the Lord. \"Why is the Lord doing this to me?\" Or, \"Why did He do this to me?\", when he finds out that it was a test.\nThe gopis didn't become disturbed when Krsna tested them and left their association. Under no circumstances would they reject Krsna even though Krsna was testing them to intensify their love.\nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur gives so many examples in his commentaries in the Tenth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, about how the Lord intensfies the love of His devotees.\nIn one morning walk conversation Srila Prabhupada had with his disciples in Tehran, Prabhupada called such testing the \"acid test.\" He said, \"Just like if you want to test gold to see if it is genuine, you put it through the acid test.\"\nIn this morning walk conversation some devotees asked Srila Prabhupada, \"Srila Prabhupada, is it true that Krsna tests His devotee every day?\"\nPrabhupada replied, \"For the devotee, Krsna is always testing.\" Prabhupada gave the examples of Bali Maharaja, Prahlada Maharaja, and Narada Muni. Then one devotee asked Prabhupada, \"Prabhupada does that mean that the more advanced the devotee becomes the more severe the test is for the devotee?\" And Prabhupada's answer was, \"No. When a devotee is very advanced and he's passed the test, there is no more testing. But if one wants to be recognized as great devotee, then one must be severely tested.\" Then Prabhupada gave the example, just like when you want to test gold to make sure it is genuine, you give it the acid test.\"\nThen one devotee asked Srila Prabhupada, \"What is the symptom of that advancement? That one has firm faith?\" And Prabhupada said, \"Faith may be there or may not be there.\" And then another devotee asked another question, although I can't remember that question.\" But he was trying to determine what was the symptom of this advanced devotee, that he is able to pass the severe test by Krsna. And Prabhupada answered, \"A devotee's nature is that he must serve. That is always his nature. He must serve under any circumstances. Even if he is experiencing difficulty, even if he's being punished, he goes on doing his service. That is the symptom of somebody who has passed the test. He does not stop serving.\" That was Prabhupada's answer. \nAnd then one devotee asked, \"So therefore we should accept the order of our spiritual master as our life and soul?\" And Prabhupada said, \"Yes. That is the symptom. When one accepts the instructions of his spiritual master as his life and soul and under any circumstances he continues to serve that instruction. He will be recognized by Krsna.\"\nSo this is how Prabhupada gave the criteria for passing the test.\nSo Madhavendra Puri is such an ideal example; for many reasons. It was Lord Caitanya who said about Madhavendra Puri, \ndharma-sthapana-hetu sadhura vyavahara\npuri-gosanira ye acarana, sei dharma sara (Madhya 17.185)\nLord Caitanya Himself quoted this verse. He said, \"A devotee's behavior establishes the true purpose of religious principles. The behavior of Madhavendra Puri is the essense of all such religious principles.\" Lord Caitanya certified Madhavendra Puri in this way.\nLord Caitanya made that statement about Madhavendra Puri when asked by a brahmana if He would accept food at the home of this brahmana. \"If Madhavendra Puri accepted food from the hand of this Sanodiya brahamana, then I must accept food from his hand also.\"\nWhen Lord Caitanya was entering Mathura, while traveling there on pilgrimage, one brahmana came before Him and began dancing in ecstacy. When Lord Caitanya saw the ecstatic symptoms manifest in this brahmana, they embraced each other. Tears began flowing from both of their eyes. They fell down on the ground in ecstasy. Lord Caitanya was thinking, \"How is it that I am experiencing such ecstasy by embracing this brahmana? And how is this brahmana dancing with such ecstatic love for Krsna?\" So He took the brahmana aside and said, \"Tell me. How is it possible that you have manifested such ecstatic symptoms like this?\nThe brahmana replied, \"Madhavendra Puri visited my home one time. I invited him to my home to accept food from me. Madhavendra Puri not only accepted food from me but he accepted me as his disciple. Lord Caitanya said, \"I knew there must have been a connection with Madhavendra Puri. Nobody can manifest such symptoms as this without having had some connection with Madhavendra Puri.\"\nThen Balabhadra Bhattacarya, who had been traveling with Lord Caitanya had to explain everything to the brahmana about what Lord Caitanya's connection with Madhavendra Puri was. Madhavendra Puri was the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya's spiritual master, Isvara Puri.\nThen Lord Caitanya certified. He said that, \"If Madhavendra Puri accepted you as his disciple, and if Madhavendra Puri accepted food from your hand, then certainly I must follow his example.\" Initially the brahmana had invited Lord Caitanya to his home, but then asked Balabhadra Bhattacarya, \"Here I'll give you all the ingredients. I'm not qualified to cook for this sannyasi. You cook for Him.\" But Lord Caitanya said, \"No. You cook for me. If Madhavendra Puri accepted food from you, then I must accept food from you also\"\nIt's for this reason He quoted the verse, \ndharma-sthapana-hetu sadhura vyavahara\npuri-gosanira ye acarana, sei dharma sara (Madhya 17.185)\n\"A devotee's behavior establishes the true purpose of religious principles. The behavior of Madhavendra Puri Gosvami is the essence of such religious principles.\"\nIn Caitanya Caritamrita the next famous verse quoted is, \ntarko \u2018pratisthah srutayo vibhinna\nnasav rsir yasya matam na bhinnam\ndharmasya tattvam nihitam guhayam\nmahajano yena gatah sa panthah\nMahabharata, Vana-parva (313.117)\nThe solid truth of religious principles is hidden in the heart of the unadulterated devotee of the Lord. Therefore one must follow his example.In so many respects we follow the example of Madhavendra Puri who taught the ideal example by his complete willingness to go 1,000 miles on foot to get sandalwood and camphor in order to reduce the temperature of the Deity Gopal.\nThere are so many similar examples in sastra.\nIf I were to cite and elaborate on the examples of how the Lord tests His devotees, we would be here until tonight. It is the prerogative of the Lord to test His devotees. If He wishes to test then the devotee very happily accepts the test, even though he does not know it's a test when it's happening.Bali Maharaja is a perfect example of someone who was tested by the Lord when the Lord requested three steps of land and took everything in two. Not only that, but Bali Maharaja had to reject the instruction of his spiritual master, because he understood the true principles of religion. Then, because Bali Maharaja wasn't able to fulfill his promise to give three steps to the Lord the Lord had him arrested by the ropes of Varuna and also insulted.\nBut Bali Maharaja passed the test with \"flying colors.\" He found a way to give the Lord His third footstep by his full surrender, atma-nivedana. The Lord gave him his own planet known as Sutala and became his gatekeeper so that he was constantly able to see the Lord. The Lord wants to give something back to His devotee. He becomes so pleased by their surrender.\nLord Nityananda would frequently go to the house of Srivasa Thakur. He would behave just like a child and would accept food from Srivasa's wife.\nOne time, in the house of Srivasa Thakur, Lord Caitanya said to Srivasa, \"Srivasa what are you doing? Why are you feeding this avadhuta? You don't even know His background. You don't even know His birth. And you're feeding Him in your home? Don't you know that you could lose your reputation from this? You could lose everything from this?\"\nSrivasa replied, \"Oh why are you testing me in this way? I know who Nityananda is. Nityananda is non-different from Your body. You love Nityananda as if He is nondifferent from Your own self. Even if Nityananda is a drunkard, even if I lose my life, my wealth, my family, my reputation, I don't care. I will always serve Nityananda.\"\nLord Caitanya exclaimed, \"What are you saying Srivasa? You have faith in Nityananda?\" Lord Caitanya became so ecstatic when He saw Srivasa's faith in Lord Nityananda. He said, \"Because of your faith in Nityananda, even if the goddess of fortune becomes impoverished and has to go door-to-door and beg, there will never be poverty in your home. Even the dogs, cats, and other animals in your home, will achieve pure devotional service because of your faith in Nityananda. My benediction is that I give you Nityananda. Please serve Him in your home.\" The Lord was so pleased. He was simply testing Srivasa.\nAnother time Lord Caitanya tested Srivasa. He came up to Srivasa and asked, \"Srivasa, how do you maintain your family? You don't do anything for their mainenance. How are you going to maintain them in the future? Why don't you do something? Make some effort to maintain them?\"Srivasa replied, \"No. I do not have to make such arrangements. By the arrangement of the Lord, they will have all of their necessities.\" So Lord Caitanya said to Srivasa, \"Srivasa, I think you should take sannyasa.\" And Srivasa said, \"No that's not possible. I cannot take sannyasa.\" Lord Caitanya, said, \"You're not going to take sannyasa and you're not going to even make any effort to go out and beg. So tell me what will happen to your family? What do you have to say about that?\"Srivasa went, (Niranjana Swami claps three times), like this three times. Lord Caitanya said, \"What does this mean? Tell me. What does this mean?\" Srivasa replied, \"One, two three. I will fast if the Lord will not provide anything for me. And if after three times I have to fast, if the Lord does not provide, then I will tie a clay pot around my neck and I will drown myself in the Ganga.\"\nLord Caitanya responded, \"Srivasa, what are you saying? Don't you know what I said in Bhagavad-gita?\nananyas cintayanto mam\nye janah paryupasate\ntesam nityabhiyuktanam\nyoga-ksemam vahamy aham (Bg 9.22)\nDon't you remember that I said these words in Bhagavad-gita? Why would you have to fast three times? Don't you know that I say that whatever my devotee is lacking, I will carry personally for them?\"\nAgain, Lord Caitanya gave the same reference. He said, \"Even if the goddess of fortune has to go begging from door-to-door, there will never be poverty in your home. You will never know the meaning of suffering. And I always provide whatever My devotee needs. I will personally carry it on My head to your door.\"The Lord was testing. We should get such a test. In fact, Lord Caitanya said to Srivasa. He said, \"What would happen if by your not doing anything one day you will find that there is no food to eat?\" But Srivasa's faith was so firm. And the Lord gave this example, \"Yes. I will always provide.\"So many examples of testing. The Lord tests the devotee but the devotee passes the test.In Jagannath Puri, one day Lord Caitanya called for Sanatana Goswami to come and to see Him at lunch time. It was noon time, the hottest time of the day. And Lord Caitanya told His servant Govinda, \"Tell Sanatana Goswami to come here.\"So as soon as Sanatana Goswami heard this, immediately he came to see Lord Caitanya. But he came along the beach. And at noon time, in the month of May-June. You know what it's like in India in the month of May-June. So at noon time the sand on the beach is so hot that your feet blister. Sanatana Goswami came by the beach. He came to Lord Caitanya and Lord Caitanya had already finished His lunch. And some remnants were given to Santana Goswami. Then he approached the Lord and the Lord said, \"Sanatana, how did you get here?\"\n\"Well, I came by the beach.\"\n\"Why did you come by the beach? The sand is so hot. Your feet must be blistering in so much pain.\"Sanatana Goswami said, \"It was not possible for me to come the other way. If I went the other way I would have had to go by the Simha-dvara gate. And there at the Simha-dvara gate the pujaris are going back and forth constantly. If I would have touched one of the pujaris, they would have become impure and contaminated and they wouldn't have been able to do an offering. I didn't feel the hot sand. I didn't even feel any blisters on my feet.\" Even though his feet were actually all blistered.Lord Caitanya became so pleased. He was testing Sanatana Goswami. And He began to glorify Sanatana Goswami. He said, \"Oh Sanatana, you are the deliverer of the entire universe. Anyone becomes purified simply by the sight of you. All the saints and the demigods become purified and are eager to touch you. But still in order to teach proper Vaisnava etiquette, you have set this example. This is the actual ornament of a Vaisnava. A Vaisanava is always setting the example of ideal religious principles and etiquette.\"Sanatana Goswami considered himself to be contaminated because of his contact with Muslims. He would not go by the Simha-dvara gate because he was afraid that one of the pujaris would touch him. At this time also all of these sores were oozing all over Sanatana Goswami's skin because he had drunk bad water in the forest of Jarikhanda. Despite thinking in this way and appearing this way, what did Lord Caitanya do? He picked up Sanatana Goswami and He embraced him and held him tightly in His embrace. This is how dear Sanatana Goswami is to the Lord.So the Lord tested Sanatana Goswami. But Sanatana Goswami passed the test with flying colors.\nWe can give so many examples. The Lord tested Murari Gupta. You know the pastime, how the Lord was trying to get Murari Gupta to give up his attachment to the lotus feet of Lord Ramachandra. But Murari Gupta was none of than Hanuman, and by his unswerving dedication to serving Lord Ramachandra, he pleased Lord Caitanya.\nLord Caitanya tested Mukunda Datta. When Lord Caitanya was giving benedictions to all the Vaisnavas during the sata-prahariya bhava, the ecstasy of twenty-one hours, or the maha-prakasa lila, He was calling all of the devotees one by one to come and accept a benediction from Him. But He didn't call Mukunda. Many of the devotees asked, \"Lord, what are you doing? Why are You dealing with Your dear devotee in this way?\"\nMukunda was standing behind the curtain. He couldn't come before the Lord because the Lord never called him. But He called everybody else. And then the Lord said, \"That Mukunda. I will never give him a benediction. He comes here in our association and he behaves just like a Vaisnava, always talking about bhakti, but when he's in others' association, with the impersonalists, he's agreeing with them and speaking their philosophy. He's carrying in one hand a piece of grass and he's carrying in the other hand an iron mace to beat Me. I will not give any benediction to Him.\"\nMukunda heard this and he was thinking that he wanted to give up his life. So he told Srivasa, \"Srivasa, ask Him, when will I see Him? When will He let me see Him again.\" And Lord Caitanya said, \" After ten million births he will see Me.\"Ten million births! Now that's a test. If we're going to talk about tests. Imagine hearing you had to wait, not only the time of ten million births before you could see the Lord, but you have to take million births in ten million bodies before you get to that point. Imagine right now if somebody tells you, \"It's in your astrological chart. You have ten million more births.\" What are you going to think? What did Mukunda think? He began dancing in ecstasy. \"I will see. I will see.\" Because he had such faith in the Lord's words that he will see the Lord after ten million births. That's all he heard that he will see. The ten million births were insignificant to him. He will see again. And he was dancing.\nThen Lord Caitanya said to Srivasa, \"Srivasa. Call Mukunda. \"Mukunda, Mukunda, Mukunda.\" He couldn't hear anything. He was just dancing. They had to pick him up and carry him and they put him in front of the Lord. Ten million births were reduced to one moment. Why? Because, as He told Mukunda, \"You have such faith in My words. You cannot possibly commit any offenses to Me. From this day on, even if you commit ten million offenses, I will not consider them offenses. You cannot commit an offense. You are so dear to Me.\"\nThat's how the Lord deals with His devotees. The Lord gave Mukunda the benediction. He said, \"Every time I descend, you will descend with Me and you will sing for Me.\" A devotee never loses. A devotee always wins and the Lord's ecstasy increases. He gets an opportunity to glorify His devotee. He gets an opportunity to reciprocate with His devotee. He gets the opportunity He hankers for, to serve His devotee, because the Lord is so obliged by the selfllessness of His devotee in his willingness to accept inconveniences for Him. So again, the translation to this verse, \"To test the intense love of Madhavendra Puri, Gopala, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ordered him to bring sandalwood from Nilacala, and when Madhavendra Puri passed this examination, the Lord became very merciful to him. (Madhya 4.18)\nAnybody can think of some more tests? Any examples? I guess I'm testing all of you by keeping you from taking prasadam. Maybe I should stop here and reward you for sitting so long by letting you take Radhe Syama's mahaprasadam. Hare Krsna. Srila Prabhupada ki jaya!Translator: Can he ask something? \nDevotee: I am a very critical, arguing person and I always get in arguments with others. Everyone knows that I have this bad mentality. And that's why I always have conflicts with everybody. But I'm convinced that I am right. And therefore I'm always arguing with others and I am complaining about others. But somehow I'm doing my service. So can I say that I have passed the test?\nAnswer: You will have passed the test when all the Vaisnavas are pleased by your service. Not displeased. We gave that as part of the criteria. Right? Your passing the test is pleasing to Vaisnavas. So if Vaisnavas are displeased, you have some way to go.\nDevotee: Am I able to keep up my service if I continue with this mentality.Answer: Well you have to be careful. There is a limit as to how much the Lord will tolerate. Only will for so long will He tolerate. At some point He won't tolerate it any more. This is your test. You're supposed to learn something from all of this. And if the only thing that you have gotten out of all of this is that you are always right, you still have a lot to learn. So you should accept that as a test, that there is something that you are supposed to learn and that's why it keeps on happening again and again. It's Krsna's test. So you are very fortunate that Krsna is testing you in the association of devotees.\nDevotee: One more question. Another topic. I was reading about Dhruva Maharaja yesterday. And Dhruva Maharaja was saying that the words of his mother broke his heart and mind as arrows. And Srila Prabhupada says that actually when someone's heart and mind breaks it's like a clay pot, it's not possible to fix it again. How should we think when we get something from devotees that breaks our heart and mind. When we get hurt by devotees.\nAnswer: I recall that Prabhupada also mentioned that it was because Dhruva was a ksatriya and therefore because he was a ksatriya he was so determined to do anything required to prove false the words of his step-mother. But it's true that a devotee's heart (I'm not speaking specifically about a ksatriya's heart) is soft. If the devotee's heart is broken by the behavior of another devotee then obviously it's painful. But one of the characteristics of a devotee is that he is forgiving. A ksatriya may not be so forgiving, because he has to defend the ksatriya dharma. But the Vaisnava is always forgiving. But generally, he's forgiving if somebody apologizes. If they actually realize that they did something wrong to break your heart.\nBut then you also have to determine, is it your heart that's broken or is it your false ego? If it's your false ego, you should be thanking them.\nDevotee: How can I distinguish if it's my false ego?\nAnswer: The symptom of your false ego being broken is that you become angry. That's the symptom. It's called virodha-yukta-krodha, which means anger which arises from attachment. So if you feel angry. There's only certain ways, according to Narottama das Thakur, that you can dovetail your anger. When you see another devotee being mistreated, then you can become angry. You want to protect that devotee. But towards oneself. The devotee doesn't become angry.\ntiraskrta vipralabdhah\nsaptah ksipta hata api\nnasya tat pratikurvanti\ntad-bhaktah prabhavo 'pi hi\n\"The devotees of the Lord are so forbearing that even though they are defamed, cheated, cursed, disturbed, neglected or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves.\" (SB 1.18.48)\nThat is the symptom of a devotee. It's in the first Canto of Bhagavatam. It's a statement about Pariksit Maharaja. After Pariksit Maharaja garlanded a snake around Samika Rsi, when Samika Rsi learned that his son Srngi cursed Pariksit, he was thinking. \"Oh what has my son has done? Pariksit is such a exalted, pure king. My son will only be properly dealt with if Pariksit Maharaja countercurses him. But Pariksit Maharaja will never do it.\" \nThen he quoted this verse. Devotees won't do it. So one of the symptoms, you will know if it's your false ego, is that you will become angry and you will want to get revenge. Then you know it's false ego.\nDevotee: So a devotee's heart cannot be broken.A devotee's heart can be broken. Yes. But still the example is there. But even if a devotee's heart is broken the Lord is always inclined to repair it. And therefore it's not actually permanently broken. The Lord will never deal that way with His devotee. The Lord never rejects His devotee. We may think, \"My heart is broken because I am feeling rejected.\" But the Lord always proves true that He never rejects His devotee. It's simply an illusion. That's all.\nSometimes the Lord will put His devotee in a situation like that under the influence of His internal potency. But the Lord will always prove that He never rejects a devotee. The devotee thinks, \"I was punished. That is the symptom of the Lord's love for me. That means that I've been recognized as a servant.\"\nThe Lord won't punish just anybody. Sometimes He punishes the demons and they get an opportunity to merge into His brahman effulgence. But when the Lord punishes the devotee then the devotee thinks, \"The Lord has recognized me as His servant and therefore He is punishing me.\"\nThe Lord will never reject His devotee. Neither will a devotee reject another devotee.\nThank you so much Maharaja.\nOK? Hare Krsna.\n","nid":"1871"},{
"title":"Transcription of Evening Discussion between Sivarama Swami, Candramauli Swami, Niranjana Swami, Sridama and Kishori","ref":"","attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Budapest","Counselor System"],"date":"Thu, 2010-06-10 15:28","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is part one of a two-part transcription. This discussion took place on May 16, 2010, after the Bhakta Sanga Festival earlier that day.\nPresent were Sivarama Swami, Candramauli Swami, Niranjana Swami, Sridama dasa, Kishori devi dasi, Guruttama dasa, and a group of devotees who were actively taking part in the development of the counselor system in Hungary.\nSridama and Kishori had just spent one week in Hungary and were leaving early the following morning. Everyone gathered to express gratitude to them for all they had contributed during their visit. The result, however, was that a very sweet exchange ensued.\n\nGuruttama Dasa: So I would like to ask Sivarama Maharaja to say a couple of words.\nSivarama Swami: Thank you very much. Like Niranjana Maharaja was saying earlier when you were having the joint discussion\u2014we were trained in a certain way. Srila Prabhupada was racing against the clock. He trained us up to be fanatics and to not worry about the future\u2014 to just do what is needed to be done and don't think about anything else. Prabhupada placed emphasis on devotees. But he placed more emphasis on projects. In his will he talked about buildings. That wasn't Prabhupada's constitution. His real constitution was actually the program of building up those type of systems that would actually take care of devotees. And it's there in Prabhupada's books in Prabhupada's lectures and in Prabhupada's teachings. And Prabhupada expected that devotees would understand that message.\nRadhanath Maharaja understood. Niranjana Maharaja understood. Sivarama Swami is starting to understand it. But it always takes time to make paradigm shifts. Especially fanatics, they run fast. So that means that when you run fast it's harder to make an 180 degree turn, because a lot of things fall out the window when you do that.\nWhen you're driving slowly then it's (?). So we really welcome that you're helping us make that transition to realize what Srila Prabhupada actually wanted of the Krsna consciousness movement. That after getting the basics that the real principle is there. And that is that we have an organization that perpetuates itself by devotees being able to take care of devotees. Because buildings don't take care of devotees. Buildings don't even take care of buildings. In fact buildings don't take care of anything. And so we are very grateful that you're here helping to do that. Niranjana Maharaja, he's like an isotope. Yeah. Radioactive isotope. He just stays in one place and then radioactivity.....\nNiranjana Swami: More like a cancer cell.\nSivarama Swami: Everything becomes radioactive around him.\nKishori: He's the treatment for cancer.\nSivarama Swami: And then everything else starts with the same type of whatever it is, whether it's\u2026 And Maharaja sort of glows that energy of taking care of devotees. And it's all catching on. It's sort of happening.\nSo we're really obliged. Especially the devotees are very thankful. But anyway we request that you sort of stay in the ball game until it's fully manifest. Even Jarasandha said to Krishna, \"Heroes don't brag until they've actually won the battle.\" So we are sort of fighting the battle. When you come and we have a full stadium of devotees. And then we also have to have a packed house on Sundays or Saturdays or Tuesdays. Then you don't have to work when you come here. You can just come and visit and relax. Take a break from Mumbai. Get some fresh air in New Vraja Dhama. Anyway, thank you very much. Srila Prabhupada ki jaya! Radhanath Swami ki jaya!\nGuruttama Dasa: Gaura Sakti Prabhu also asked me to thank you for coming and teaching us. He had to go back to the farm. When I talked to him he said that he's so enthusiastic and so much grateful that all these things are happening also in the Budapest community. I don't know him for a long time but since I've known him, now I'm seeing him the most enthusiastic that I've ever seen him. So these are really thanks for you. And we're really hoping that you will come back soon and that we can prove you that your coming here is not just a waste of time. We can do something to please (?) and also please give us your blessings that we can doing something in this direction. Sridama Prabhu ki jaya! Kishori Mataji ki jaya!\nNiranjana Swami: Can I just say one thing? I just want to take issue with something that Sivarama Maharaja said. \nGuruttama Dasa: About being an isotope?\nNiranjana Swami: He said that he's just catching on. But I completely disagree. He's way ahead of us. And New Vraja Dhama is proof that he's way ahead of us and he's thinking of the future of the devotees. There's no project like it in the world. And anyone who visits says the same thing. By bringing everyone to the lotus feet of Radhe Syama, he's thinking of everyone's future. So I cannot accept that statement.\nSivarama Swami: (Unclear) Fortunately, \"everyone\" is not living there.\nKishori: I want to say something. Maharaja is saying that taking care of devotees he is learning now. But actually I see that each one of you is such a jewel and unless (?) he has put so much time and energy and care in each one of you, you cannot be what you are. And the way he takes care of all of you, he also takes care of Niranjana Maharaja. So many times we discuss of all the places in the world he could go, he finds that caring, shelter in Hungary. You are already doing so much Maharaja. It is your great humility to push others in front. \nI was telling Niranjana Maharaja, that in the pastime of Dhruva Maharaja, when he was performing austerities, at one point he took out the air from the entire universe. And everybody in the universe was affected. So even though he [Sivarama Swami] is sitting in one place, but actually he is affecting the whole world. Please bless us that we can remain a humble instrument in the hands of Guru Maharaja and all of you. Because we genuinely (?).\nAnd one thing that I want to say is that when we went to Ukraine we used to say that one day will come when the devotees will come to Ukraine to learn the counselor system. We were telling the devotees there that devotees will come from all over the world to Kiev to learn the counselor system. But as soon as the Hungarian yatra takes up this mood the whole world will be inspired. Because as Niranjana Maharaja mentioned, that in India people (?) culture. So you are doing so much. Thank you very much.\nSivarama Swami: Hare Krishna. Let me just add. That when Niranjana Maharaja was sick I told him that if he comes to New Vraja Dhama, Radhe Syama would cure him. And not that he's with me. Plus he's sort of \"on the mend\" (He's getting better). Plus we have doctors who are sort of working on him. But anyway, let's talk about. I just want to turn the topic. And that's something that we sort of mentioned earlier. Actually the person who this really comes from, I mean originally it comes through Krishna, and it comes through Srila Prabhupada, is Radhanath Maharaja. And it was a good thing that he stuck to it three times. But ultimately it was Radhanath Maharaja's real conviction. Ever since I've known him, he has a sort of an aura, as well as a practice that he carries with him, that taking care of Vaisnavas and Vaisnavis is our prime business. That's what he indicates in GBC meetings. Why don't you speak about him? Sridama, say something about your Guru Maharaja.\nSridama: Maharaja, I'm completely dumbstruck. My mouth is not opening.\nSivarama Swami: You can't talk about your guru?\nSridama: I'm just amazed to see the exchange that's happening in front of my eyes. \nSivarama Swami: Well he's not here so you have to be his rittvik.\nSridama: I was just witnessing this exchange and honestly whatever both of us are doing - the three of us are doing - is only for one purpose. We want to please our spiritual master. He has stated it very emphatically to us that the most powerful ways that he can be pleased is if we please his godbrothers. So I was telling Kishori in the afternoon that I feel extremely so blessed and so humbled. Actually I'm like a very small insect. Honestly. But we've been so extremely blessed to be sitting, talking, seeing, these pure devotees exchanging themselves with each other. So, I feel that he is, my guru maharaja, Radhanath Maharaja is showering his blessings upon me because I can see that his godbrothers are pleased with us. And I feel greatly blessed to be able to do what we are able to do. Personally speaking if you ask me, I really have no intentions to really talk about any devotee care, but we simply do this so that we can get the association of all these great souls. And we see the smile guru maharaja's face.\nLast time when we came to Hungary, the first we met him in Bombay was at a marriage function. Maharaja was on the other side. He walked all the way through the hall. He said, \"How was Hungary? Please tell me. I'm very keen to know. What happened there?\" So I know how much he values this project that Sivarama Maharaja is heading. And I feel more and more ecstatic to just contribute in a small way. We are not at all qualified to do what we are doing.\nAnd one more thing is that Sivarama Maharaja as he mentioned in the morning. He is changing his role. He invested lots in all of you and now he is expecting returns from all of you. That's what Radhanath Maharaja told us. He said, \"I've done lots for you. Now I want returns.\" So I can see what sort of trouble that Sivarama Maharaja has gone through since 1992 to set up this project. How much prayers have gone into it. How much months and years of anxiety has gone into it. And this is all for all of you. All of us rather. And now it is time that he takes a break. Niranjana Maharaja takes a break. All these great souls take a break and we have to give them returns of what they have done for us. That is what I see of your (?) to me. And if we do this Srila Prabhupada will be showering unlimited blessings upon all of us. Hare Krsna.\nSivarama Swami: Thank you very much.\nSridama: Sorry for not being able to be a gentleman.\nSivarama Swami: It's nice to see devotees with tears in their eyes. That's what Krishna consciousness is about.\nSridama: I was just telling Niranjana Maharaja yesterday. He was saying, \"There's something in your eye. What happened?\" And then I said, \"Maharaja, I don't cry enough. The tear glands are (?). But now I feel happy that you made me cry. Maharaja, this morning, what I heard was simply too much. \nSivarama Swami (pointing to Candramauli Maharaja): See, he knew Radhanath Maharaja before.\nSridama: Yes, they were milking cows together.\nSivarama Swami: He should say something.\nCandramauli Swami: Maharaja was milking the cows. I was taking the milk and making butter. \nKishori: Candramauli Maharaja is the shadow of Radhanath Maharaja.\nSivarama Swami: He's like salt. He goes good with everything.\nCandramauli Swami: I'm too salty.\nSridama: Maharaja, you are right. He preaches in India, parts of Maharastra where there is big (?). And at the same time he preaches in Slovenia. So you are right. There is two extremes.\nTo be continued\u2026\n","nid":"1820"},{
"title":"Transcription of Sunday Feast Lecture in Budapest, February 14, 2010","ref":{"target_id":"1081"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Budapest"],"date":"Fri, 2010-05-07 13:10","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially edited transcription of a Sunday Feast Lecture given in Budapest on February 14, 2010, from the bhajan, Bhajahu Re Mana.\nFebruary 14, 2010, Budapest, Sunday Fest lecture\n(file name: 2010.02.14_Sunday.Feast_Budapest.mp3)\n[Guru Maharaja starts lecture here] \nSo, we are going to chant a song by Govinda das Kaviraja. This is a well known song \"Bhajahu Re Mana Sri Nanda-nandana\". Devotees oftentimes get together to sing different bhajans, written by great saintly persons describing the glories of the Lord and the process of devotional service to the Lord. \nThis is a song written by a great poet whose name was Govinda das Kaviraja. He wrote many books on poetry and was given the title \"Kaviraja\" because of his beautiful and eloquent poetry. Both he and his brother were great Vaishnavas. Ramacandra Kaviraja was his brother. They were both disciples of Srinivas Acarya \u2013 another Acarya, or spiritual master, in our disciplic succession. \nAlthough, Govinda das Kaviraja in his childhood was not a worshiper of Lord Krsna, he had inclinations towards Krsna in his childhood. But he was under the influence of his maternal grand-father, who was a worshipper of goddess Durga. It is described that his mother, who was a devotee of Lord Krsna, was having difficulty in giving birth to her child. She went to her father and requested his assistance, but he was in the middle of doing his Durga puja, or worship of Durga.\nSo, someone went to him for his assistance, but he said, \"Simply take one of these weapons (which Durga holds in her hands) and take it and show it to her, and she will give birth without difficulty.\"\nAnyway, he didn't have time to explain everything, but the person took it and poured water over the weapon, took the water and gave it to Govinda das Kaviraja's mother to drink. After she drank it, she immediately was able to give birth. Although she could have died, or the child could have died, after drinking this water, he took birth under normal circumstances. Therefore he was well-known from that time on as somebody who had taken birth by the mercy of goddess Durga.\nDue to the influence of his maternal grand-father, in his childhood Govinda das also worshipped goddess Duga, who is the goddess of material energy. Worshippers of the material energy generally worship Goddess Durga for some material benediction, whereas the worshippers of Lord Krsna generally worship the Lord for pure devotion. Therefore there is a stark difference between the worshippers of the material energy and the worshipper of the Person who is the origin of the material energy, Krsna. \nOf course, persons can approach Krsna also for some material gain. But Krsna is so completely pure, that even if one approaches Krsna for material gain, gradually one's heart becomes purified, and one will gradually come to realize that Krsna can give something far greater than material gain. \nThis is explained in Srimad-bhagavatam,\nakamah sarva-kamo va\nmoksa-kama udara-dhih\ntivrena bhakti-yogena\nyajeta purusam param\n\"A person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of all material desire, without any material desire, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.\" [SB 2.3.10]\nKrsna is pavitram, He is completely pure. He is just like the sun, who can purify even the most impure place by its ultraviolent rays, whereas the worshippers of the material energy simply give some material boon in reciprocation for the particular type of worship. So, those who are worshipping Durga for material gain, may obtain material gain but they don't get devotion to Krsna. But material gain is temporary. That is described here in the song by Govinda das Kaviraja, who as we said, although in his childhood was the worshipper of Durga, later in life he became a great Vaishnava, a worshipper of the Supreme Lord. And he says in this song,\ne dhana, yaubana, putra, parijana\nithe ki ache paratiti re\nkamala-dala-jala, jivana talamala\nbhajahu hari-pada niti re\n\"What assurance of real happiness is there in all of one's wealth, youthfulness, sons, and family members? This life is tottering like a drop of water on a lotus petal; therefore you should always serve and worship the divine feet of Lord Hari.\" [Bhajahu Re Mana bhajan, verse 3]\nJust as a drop of water appears on a lotus leaf, such is this life. So let me immediately take up the worship of Sri Hari, the only necessity. \nSo we thought that we should explain the difference between the worshipers of Durga and the worshippers of Krsna. Govinda Kaviraja, as we said, later became great devotee of the Lord by association with a devotee of the Lord.\nTherefore, in the beginning of this song, he describes the great value of association with devotees of the Lord.\ndurlabha manava-janama sat-sange\ntaroho e bhava-sindhu re\n\"Having obtained this rare human birth, one should cross over this ocean of worldly existence through the association of saintly persons.\" [Bhajahu Re Mana bhajan, verse 1]\nThe song was written in mature realization. Having come to this realization by association with saintly persons, he realized the futility of worldly pursuits, and he realized the great value of possessing association with the devotees of the Lord, who are described to be like the most valuable jewels.\nSadhavah sadhu-bhusanah. Such sadhus are there. Sadhu-bhusanah means they are decorated with wonderful, beautiful ornaments of a sadhu.\ntitiksavah karunikah\nsuhrdah sarva-dehinam\najata-satravah santah\nsadhavah sadhu-bhusanah\n\"The symptoms of a sadhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.\" [SB 3.25.21] \nThese are the symptoms of the sadhu. They are kind, merciful towards everyone, and they are considered to be like the most valuable jewels because they are wearing valuable ornament of devotion to Krsna. \nSo, we will chant the song, and then we will read a little bit from the commentary that Srila Prabhupada has given to this song. I didn't plan on giving an introduction, but I thought it might be appropriate to explain the difference between the worshippers of Durga and the worshippers of Krsna, for those who may be here for the first time and may not be familiar with these terms. Is there anyone who is here for the first time? Aha. Ok. All right.\nSo, you have the song sheets. We will just sing a song and then we will speak a little bit about it.\n[Guru Maharaja starts bhajan. After bhajan Guru Maharaja continues with lecture]\nThis is a commentary on the song by our spiritual master Srila Prabhupada. We will not read the whole thing. We'll just read a little bit and then we will speak.\n\"Bhaja means worship; mana means mind. The poet Govinda dasa, a great philosopher and devotee of the Lord, he is praying. He is requesting his mind, because mind is the friend and mind is the enemy of everyone. If one can train his mind in Krsna consciousness, then he is successful. If he cannot train his mind, then life is failure. Therefore Govinda dasa, a great devotee of Lord Krsna... His very name suggests, Govinda dasa. Govinda, Krsna, and dasa means servant. This is the attitude of all devotees. They always put, affix this dasa, means servant. So Govinda dasa is praying, \"My dear mind, please you try to worship the son of Nanda, who is abhaya-carana, whose lotus feet is secure. There is no fear.\" Abhaya. Abhaya means there is no fear, and carana, carana means lotus feet. So he is advising his mind, \"My dear mind, please you engage yourself in worshiping the fearless lotus feet of the son of Nanda.\" Bhajahu re mana sri-nanda-nandana. Nanda-nandana means a son of Nanda Maharaja, Krsna. And His lotus feet is abhaya, fearless. So Govinda dasa is requesting his mind, \"Please be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lotus feet of Krsna.\" [Beginning of Srila Prabhupada's purport to Bhajahu Re Mana bhajan]\nThere is a lot more. We will stop here for now and speak a little bit.\nSo as we said. Govinda das in this song is praying to his mind, \"Please fix yourself in constant remembrance of Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja.\" By constantly fixing the mind in remembrance of Krsna one becomes fearless. This fearlessness is achieved when one transcends the dictations of the flickering mind. \nIn Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna explains that one who has controlled his mind it is his best friend, and one who fails to control his mind it is his worst enemy. He also says one who controls his mind then he reaches the Supersoul and achieves tranquility. For such a person heat and cold, happiness and distress, honor and dishonor are all the same. In another words he transcends the duality of this world. This world is world of duality: good and bad, friend and enemy, honor and dishonor. The dualities of this world exist due to lack of Krsna consciousness. \nTherefore, as Krsna explains, if one can conquer his mind he transcends these dualities of this world. One who is situated in perfect Krsna consciousness, he sees Krsna in everything. Elsewhere in the Bhagavad-gita Krsna says, \"For one who sees Me everywhere, and sees everything in Me \u2013 I am never lost to him nor is he ever lost to Me.\" In another words, one who is Krsna conscious, he's controlled his mind, he learns to see how everything is connected to Krsna.\nBut the tendency of the mind is to see things separate from Krsna. The tendency of the mind is to see things in connection to myself. When we see a beautiful object, we think, \"Let me enjoy the object.\" We hear a beautiful song, we think, \"Let me enjoy the sound. Sound is for my pleasure.\" When we see something that definitely can offer some enjoyment for our senses, whether that be the tongue, the ears, the eyes, or the sense of touch - immediately we think, \"Yes, let me take it and enjoy it for myself.\"\nSo, one who sees things this way, he doesn't see Krsna. It is very difficult for him to see Krsna. He doesn't have eyes to see Krsna, because Krsna cannot be seen with these blunt material senses. \natah sri-krsna-namadi\nna bhaved grahyam indriyaih\nsevonmukhe hi jihvadau\nsvayam eva sphuraty adah\n \"Therefore material senses cannot appreciate Krsna's holy name, form, qualities and pastimes. When a conditioned soul is awakened to Krsna consciousness and renders service by using his tongue to chant the Lord's holy name and taste the remnants of the Lord's food, the tongue is purified, and one gradually comes to understand who Krsna really is.\" [CC Madya 17.136]\nAs Lord Brahma described in his prayers,\npremanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena\nsantah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti\n\"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Syamasundara, Krsna Himself with inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love.\" [Brahma-samhita 5.38]\n So, these eyes cannot see. The eyes which see things for our own enjoyment cannot see Krsna. The eyes, tongue, senses, the nose, ears, when they are engaged in service to Krsna they become cleansed, they are purified. One who controls his senses, who controls the mind, as we said, he can reach the Supersoul. And then he becomes peaceful and experiences tranquility. He is not dragged by the senses. \nIt is very difficult to be peaceful as long as we are dragged by the mind and the senses. It's like, if we observe the behavior of an animal, we can see that animal senses are constantly distracted from one thing to the next and then to the next. \nI was speaking to a group of people last week, and I was telling them how before I came to Krsna consciousness I had a Labrador retriever. This dog was with me all the time and I used to observe her behavior. Any sound, any smell, any sight, would immediately stimulate her and she would immediately run in order to capture. The nature of animals is that they cannot control themselves, they have to act according to instincts. The impulse is there, they act according to immediate impulse. It is very difficult for them to control.\nJust like this dog. One day I came home from the temple, and she was hiding. I was thinking, \"Why is she hiding? She always comes to see me.\" But she was in the corner of the room and she was hiding. Her tail was hitting the floor real hard. TAP. TAP. TAP. [Guru Maharaja produces the sound as if the dog's tail is hitting the floor] \nSo I went into the room, and I saw my japa beads were all chewed up to pieces all over the floor. [Guru Maharaja and devotees laugh] She knew she did something wrong but she couldn't control herself. She smelled something and she was hungry. She knows. She saw me with those beads all the time, chanting Hare Krsna on those beads. She didn't think, \"Should I chew on these beads?\" She didn't and she took the consequences. I came home and I saw the beads, and she was hiding. She knew she was going to get chastised. That much she knew. But she didn't know enough to not chew the beads. That is the nature of an animal, they act according to instinct and that's why it is very difficult for them to consider the consequences of their actions.\nWhereas the human being is supposed to consider the consequences, and with his higher intelligence he is supposed to control the mind and the senses. So, therefore one has to discriminate between what is right and what is wrong. Controlling the senses is not a very easy thing. \nBut Krsna is very kind. Just as every morning before we take prasadam we offer our prayer to Krsna, \"He is very kind because He has given us nice prasadam to help us to control the tongue.\" A devotee doesn't eat ordinary food, he eats food whish has been offered to Krsna, so that one not only get's the benefit of nourishment from the food he eats, but he also gets spiritual nourishment.\nvisaya vinivartante\nniraharasya dehinah\nrasa-varjam raso 'py asya\nparam drstva nivartate\n\"The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.\" [BG 2.59]\nIn another words, a person may restrict himself but restriction is not easy, because the tendency to extract the taste from that experience is still there. We still think, \"Yes, I will enjoy.\" Therefore, when one tries to restrict himself from the tendency for sense enjoyment, it is not easy. But once one experiences a higher taste, it is easier for him to become fixed in consciousness.\nTherefore, Krsna consciousness is based on the principle of experiencing a higher taste. Another name for Krsna is Govinda. Govinda means \"One who gives pleasure to the senses.\" It also means \"One who gives pleasure to the cows.\" But here, in this particular reference, we are speaking about giving pleasure to the senses.\nHe is also known as Hrisikesa \u2013 or Master of the senses. [Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu 1.12]\nsarvopadhi-vinirmuktam\ntat-paratvena nirmalam\nhrsikena hrsikesa-\nsevanam bhaktir ucyate \nSarvopadhi-vinirmuktam \u2013 When one engages in devotional service to the Supreme Lord then automatically there are two by-products that take place. Sarva upadhi. Upadhi means designations. Sarva means all kinds of designations. So one becomes freed from all kinds of material designations. This is one of the by-products of devotional service to Krsna - He becomes free from material designations. He becomes free from designations of \"I am this temporary material body, I am American, I am Hungarian, I am Russian, I am Chinese. I am father and mother. I am president.\" He becomes free from all of these designations. \nAnd he realizes what his actual spiritual designation is. jivera 'svarupa' haya\u2014krsnera 'nitya-dasa' \"My real identity is not based upon acceptance of this temporary, physical body, but my real identity is that I am eternal servant of Krsna.\" [CC Madhya 20.108-109] \nWhen one serves Krsna, this is one of the by-products - he becomes free from designations. \nAnd the other by-product is\u2026 Krsna is known as Hrsikesa. [Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu 1.12]\nhrsikena hrsikesa-\nsevanam bhaktir ucyate\nHrsikesa means \"the master of the senses\". What happens is that one's senses will automatically become controlled. Krsna will help us to control the senses by giving us a superior pleasure. Just like Prabhodananda Sarasvati, in one of his prayers to Lord Caitanya, glorifies Lord Caitanya. He says, \"Anyone who has received the merciful glance of Lord Caitanya, then the serpents of the senses become like serpents with broken fangs. They no longer have a poisonous effect.\"\nHe is describing the senses to be like serpents. A Serpent has a fang and immediately strikes its object, but when a serpent's fang is broken, there is no poisonous effect. So he says, \"One who has achieved the mercy of Lord Caitanya, his senses (which are like serpents) become like serpents with broken fangs.\" They cannot strike the object because the fangs are broken.\nSo, these are two by-products of devotional service to Krsna: free from designations and senses become controlled. Therefore the beauty of Krsna consciousness is that a devotee understands that \"In order to become yogi, or controller of the senses, I have to realize that I cannot do it alone.\" That is the difference between the bhakta and the yogi. The Bhakta knows he cannot control the senses by his efforts alone. In fact, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita,\nyoginam api sarvesam\nmad-gatenantar-atmana\nsraddhavan bhajate yo mam\nsa me yuktatamo matah\n\"And of all yogis, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me\u2014he is the most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My opinion.\" [BG 6.47]\nKrsna says Himself, \"This is the highest yogi.\" The highest yogi is one who always worships Krsna with great faith. Yoga means to connect, to link, to join. So, how is he joining? How is he connecting? He is connecting by engaging his mind, engaging his tongue, engaging his ears, engaging his sense of smell, and he is connecting them all with Krsna. Here is a wonderful song in glorification of Krsna. When he speaks, he speaks about topics which are connected to Krsna. He smells the fragrance of incense offered to the lotus feet of Krsna, and the fragrant flowers which have been offered to the Lord. He looks at the beautiful form of the arca-vigraha, the Deity of the Lord.\nIn this way Krsna helps the devotee to control the senses, by giving a superior pleasure in devotional service. When the senses are controlled, then the mind becomes peaceful. But if the senses and the mind are not controlled, Krsna says, they are the worst enemy because they are dragging us from here to there. Just like the animal, being dragged here and there, without any real aim in life except enjoyment.\nWhat is the nature of this enjoyment? Govinda dasa desribes here, capala sukha-laba lagi' re. Capala sukha means flickering enjoyment: it has a beginning and it has an end. It gives some immediate excitement, immediate pleasure, but because it cannot fully satisfy the self when the pleasure is gone, immediately there is hankering for more. And when there is hankering for more, then one goes to any possible endeavor to achieve the fulfillment of that desire for more. \nAnd what happens from that? The valuable goal (aim) of life is lost, the whole purpose for achieving the human form of life. \nDurlabha manava-janama sat-sange, having obtained this rare human form of life, don't waste it somply in the pursuit of sense enjoyment. The human form of life is considered to be very rare and very valuable, because with the human form of life one has the ability to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong. One can train the mind. Train his mind by his superior intelligence. He knows that the mind is a reservoir for all ideas for sense enjoyment. And therefore, with his higher intelligence he restricts the mind from the tendency for sense enjoyment. But not simply by restriction alone can he achieve this. He must have a superior engagement. \nPrabhupada used to give the example, just like a child who is naughty in class. In America, I remember, they used to do this when I was in school. If a child was naughty in class, they would send him to the corner and have him face the corner. He would just stand in the corner and look at the wall. I don't know if they do that in Hungary, but they did in America 40-50 years ago. [Guru Maharaja laughs] But I remember very vividly, anyone who was sent to the corner, that was just a spotlight for him. He would always turn around and entertain the class. Being sent to the corner, for him was like giving him a step up to stardom, to fame. [Guru Maharaja and devotee laugh] So, he would stand in the corner, and do all kinds of crazy things. And then the teacher, of course, would send him to the principal. \nSo Prabhupada said, simply to restrict is not sufficient. There has to be a superior engagement. So, simply to restrict the senses, to restrict the mind is very difficult. There needs to be a superior engagement. Just like today, devotees are chanting Hare Krsna whole day. Superior engagement. Govinda das described in his song that by meditation on Krsna one becomes fearless. And Srimad-bhagavatam says,\netan nirvidyamananam\nicchatam akuto-bhayam\nyoginam nrpa nirnitam\nharer namanukirtanam\n\"O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge.\" [SB 2.1.11]\nFor all of them, chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord is a doubtless and fearless way of success for everyone. And it is a superior engagement. By chanting Hare Krsna constantly, continuously, the result is that one experiences a higher taste and one's mind becomes controlled. This is the real objective of yoga\u2014 to control the mind. \nTherefore, Krsna gives us the means by which we can control the mind and He makes it very easy for us to think of Him and to see Him. Instead of seeing Krsna with his eyes, first one has to hear Krsna with his ears. When one hears Krsna with his ears, then gradually all his senses become purified and some day he will be able to see Krsna face to face. The sense of hearing is more important than seeing, because Krsna makes Himself very accessible in His name. Simply by chanting His name, one can come in contact with Krsna. \nkali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara\nnama haite haya sarva-jagat-nistara\n\"In this Age of Kali, the holy name of the Lord, the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, is the incarnation of Lord Krsna. Simply by chanting the holy name, one associates with the Lord directly. Anyone who does this is certainly delivered.\" [CC Adi, 17.22]\nkaler dosa-nidhe rajann\nasti hy eko mahan gunah\nkirtanad eva krsnasya\nmukta-sangah param vrajet\n\"My dear King, although Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: Simply by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.\" [SB 12.3.51]\nSo, the sense of hearing can help us to some day see Krsna. Srila Prabhupada gives the example how hearing can save us. He says if we are laying down sleeping and somebody is about to kill us, and somebody who is in the room writes down on a piece of paper \"Wake Up. Somebody is about to kill you\", and he holds it in front of your eyes, that won't save you. Your seeing will not save you. But if somebody screams out, \"Wake up! Somebody is about to kill you\", it can save you. So, hearing can save you, whereas seeing will not save you. \nSo in the same way, especially in this age, hearing (sravanam), as Govinda das says sravana, kirtana, smarana, vandana, pada-sevana - it's beginning with hearing about Krsna. When we hear about Krsna, or we hear Krsna's names, when it enters into the ear, it goes into the heart and re-awakens a remembrance of Krsna. Gradually that sound vibration, when it enters into the ear and goes to the heart, it purifies one's intelligence and one's mind so that he actually can see Krsna. Gradually he learns how to see Krsna everywhere in everything, because he understands that everything in this world is ultimately originating from Krsna. \naham sarvasya prabhavo\nmattah sarvam pravartate\niti matva bhajante mam\nbudha bhava-samanvitah\n\"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.\" [BG 10.8]\nThis is how one can see Krsna, and become fearless. He becomes abhaya-caranaravinda re. By meditation on Krsna, the divine son of Nanda, one becomes fearless. He becomes fearless because he knows that there is no death for the soul. He knows that the soul is eternal.\nJust like Prabhupada gives the example: the cat carries in her mouth a kitten and it caries in her mouth a rat. So when the cat approaches the kitten, the kitten is thinking, \"This is my mother.\" For the kitten there is no fear when the cat opens her mouth. \nI also used to have cat and kittens as a child, too. [Devotees laugh] Believe it or not, I am allergic to animals. But I was allergic to so many things that doctor told my parents, \"If you keep him away from all the things that he is allergic to, he will become neurotic.\" [Guru Maharaja laughs] Because I was allergic to so many things. So I had cats, I had dog, everything. So, I've seen, if a cat has a litter and she wants to move the kittens, she moves them one by one. She picks them up in her mouth behind the neck and she carries them away. Anybody who has seen a cat whose had a litter of kittens knows how they move their kittens and they put them in a safe place. The kittens are not running away. They think, \"This is my mother. She is coming to take me home. She is coming to protect me.\" \nBut the same cat opens her mouth and when she approaches the rat, the rat has a different perspective. The rat is not thinking, \"Oh, my mother is coming to take me home.\" [Guru Maharaja and devotees laugh]. No, the rat runs out of fear for its life, because those same teeth represent death for the rat.\nSo, Prabhupada gives this example. The kitten is like the devotee. A devotee is fearless because he sees, ultimately, this is Krsna. Just like Srila Prabhupada was describing when he was in Kolkata, and the bombs were falling. And Prabhupada was thinking, \"This is Krsna in His universal form.\" He sees Krsna. Fearless.\nSo, same thing. A devotee is fearless in the face of death, because the devotee is thinking of Krsna, he is remembering Krsna, and Krsna says, \nanta-kale ca mam eva\nsmaran muktva kalevaram\n\"And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.\" [BG 8.5]\nSo, this is the actual purpose of the human form of life, just to become Krsna conscious, to remember Krsna. And therefore, Govinda dasa is praying to his mind in the beginning of this song, \"Please mind. Please. Just fix yourself at the lotus feet of the divine son of Nanda Maharaja\", and by such meditation we will become fearless.\nThere is a lot more to this song, but we are overtime. There is more chanting to be done. So, I think we will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n[Guru Maharaja ends lecture here]\n\n","nid":"1545"},{

On Thursday at the temple I described how Srila Prabhupada, after establishing Krsna consciousness in America and Europe, decided to return to India. One devotee from each temple in North America, along with two couples from London, flew to Bombay to join Srila Prabhupada. \nIn Bombay we first stayed at Seksaria Bhavan, Kailash Seksaria\u2019s family\u2019s five-storey aristocratic home overlooking the Arabian Sea. Every morning we would gather in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s room and sing the Samsara prayers, and Srila Prabhupada would speak a little. \nOne day, Gurudasa Prabhu began to glorify another devotee, Dinanatha Prabhu, for his nice kirtanas. Then Gurudasa, noticing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s small Radha-Krsna Deities, stopped himself, because as stated in The Nectar of Devotion, \u201cOne should not eulogize or praise anyone else before the Deity.\u201d Gurudasa apologized: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Srila Prabhupada. I was glorifying someone in front of the Deities.\u201d And Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cKrsna is already glorified, but He takes more pleasure when His devotee is glorified.\u201d \nI mention this because perhaps out of regard for this rule, the Deities remained behind closed curtains during yesterday morning\u2019s program, and the deity of Srila Prabhupada came to the site only later. All that is correct according to the rules, but Srila Prabhupada, knowing Krsna\u2019s heart, said that Krsna takes more pleasure when His devotee is glorified.\nDuring that period in Bombay, Srila Prabhupada received many invitations to have prasada at different people\u2019s homes. Finally he said, \u201cWe will not accept any invitation unless the host becomes a life member.\u201d The life membership program was devised by Prabhupada as a way to distribute his books. Members would give Rs. 1,111, which was quite a large amount then, and get all of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, present and future. Then he commented, \u201cWe are making life members simply by eating.\u201d\nWe had one program at the home of a very nice man, Ramchand Chhabria. His family prepared a huge feast for Srila Prabhupada and the devotees. The Indian hospitality was such that hosts would offer Srila Prabhupada and often his devotees a place to take rest after the meal. Many of our hosts had extended families and large homes, and the family members would vacate their bedrooms, allowing Srila Prabhupada to take rest in one room and his disciples to take rest in the others.\nAfter this huge feast all the disciples went to take rest. Srila Prabhupada rested a little, but soon he was sitting and speaking with the host and remaining guests. And he could actually hear the snoring of his disciples coming from the bedrooms. Finally Srila Prabhupada said, \u201cWe better wake up my disciples; otherwise we don\u2019t know how much longer they\u2019ll sleep and then when they wake up they\u2019ll want to eat again. So we better take your leave now.\u201d \nLike that, we had many nice programs. From Bombay we went to Amritsar for the Vedanta Sammelan, and there too we had many programs. One memorable one was at the home of Baladeva Indra Singh, a noble descendant of a royal family of Punjab, and a real ksatriya. His estate, beside his own mansion, included a large gosala, many guest rooms, and a beautiful garden. Srila Prabhupada sent some of his disciples ahead to the program, and Malati dasi helped the ladies of the house cook the feast and then prepare the offering. Just when the plate was to be offered, Srila Prabhupada entered, and the devotees sang the Bhoga-arati song by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, which begins:\nbhaja bhakata-vatsala sri-gaurahari\nsri-gaurahari sohi gostha-bihari\nnanda-yasomati-citta-hari\n\u201cJust worship Sri Gaurahari, who is always affectionate toward His devotees. He is the same Supreme Godhead, Krsna, who sported in the cowherd pastures of Vraja and stole the hearts of Nanda and Yasoda.\u201d\nbela ho\u2019lo damodara aisa ekhona\nbhoga-mandire basi\u2019 karoha bhojana\n[Mother Yasoda calls to Krsna:] \u201cMy dear Damodara, it is very late. Please come right now, sit down in the dining hall, and take Your lunch.\u201d\nnandera nidese baise giri-vara-dhari\nbaladeva-saha sakha baise sari sari\n\u201cOn the direction of Nanda Maharaja, Krsna, the holder of Govardhana Hill, sits down, and then all the cowherd boys, along with Krsna\u2019s elder brother, Sri Baladeva, sit down in rows to take their lunch.\u201d\nAs we were singing in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s presence, I felt as if we were in Vrndavana with Krsna and His cowherd boyfriends while they were taking prasada with Him.\nLater, while Srila Prabhupada sat in a chair, Mr. Singh sat before him on the floor. He said that he was troubled because an astrologer had told him that in a previous lifetime, some thousands of years ago, he had fought in the Battle of Kuruksetra\u2014against Krsna! \u201cThat is not possible,\u201d Prabhupada said. \u201cEveryone present in the Battle of Kuruksetra was liberated. If you had actually been in the Battle of Kuruksetra, you would not still be in this material world.\u201d Mr. Singh didn\u2019t know whether to feel relieved or disappointed. But Prabhupada assured him, \u201cThat\u2019s all right. Don\u2019t worry. Now you are a devotee of Krsna.\u201d\nFrom Amritsar Srila Prabhupada returned to Bombay, leaving a few of us in Delhi. And then we rejoined him in Indore for the Gita Jayanti conference. There a palmist came and offered to read our futures. We asked Prabhupada whether we should allow him, and he said yes. The man looked at the devotees\u2019 palms and told one, \u201cThis will be your last life,\u201d and another, \u201cYou will have to take birth again.\u201d He made different predictions and then left. When we asked Prabhupada whether what he had said was true, Prabhupada made a face and declared, \u201cJust by clapping your hands in kirtana in front of the Deities, all the lines are washed off.\u201d \nFrom Indore, Srila Prabhupada traveled to Surat and Bombay and then Allahabad for the Ardha-kumbha-mela. It was very, very cold then, in January. The devotees were living in tents, and Srila Prabhupada was also living in one\u2014a little bigger and with a heater, but a tent nonetheless. It was so cold in the mornings that many of us, including me, preferred to stay in our sleeping bags a little longer than to come out into the cold air and bathe in the frigid water from the pump. A few very staunch devotees\u2014Tamal Krishna, Madhudvisa, Hamsaduta\u2014would rise early, walk to the Ganges, and bathe in the river, but the rest of us just stayed in our sleeping bags as long as we could. And so we would come late for mangala-arati.\nWhen Srila Prabhupada heard, he was very concerned. So the next morning at four o\u2019clock Prabhupada himself took bath outdoors in the frigid water from the pump. And of course, when news reached us in our tents, we got out of our sleeping bags as fast as we could and went out to take our baths. Srila Prabhupada was concerned that his disciples rise early in the morning, and as the acarya he set the example. \nDuring that period Srila Prabhupada was speaking from the Sixth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, on the story of Ajamila, which glorifies the holy name. Prabhupada\u2019s own translation of the Bhagavatam had reached only the Second Canto, so he would read from his large volume of Sanskrit commentaries, translating the original verses and parts of the commentaries, especially Sridhara Svami\u2019s, as he went along. They were wonderful lectures, and Prabhupada instructed that these talks should be collected and published as a book. Years later, the devotees did it; they published the book A Second Chance: The Story of a Near-Death Experience.\nIt was so cold in the mornings that the devotees\u2019 hands became numb and they could hardly move their fingers. One morning, the head pujari, Nanda-kumara, just could not light the items for the arati. Not only was the air cold and his hands numb, but it was very windy. As soon as he would begin to light a match or a ghee wick, a gust of wind would blow out the flame. Tamal Krishna even jumped up on the stage and tried to help, but eventually the wind always blew out the flame. Finally I heard over the speaker system Srila Prabhupada pronouncing in grave tones: harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam, kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha. In one sense, he may have been a little sarcastic: \u201cThese people can\u2019t even light the ghee lamp\u2014all they can do is chant Hare Krsna.\u201d But in another sense he was making a profound, serious statement: in Kali-yuga, the only means is the holy name.\nLater, in 1976, in Mayapur, I happened to be in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s room when a disciple came in to discuss the Deity worship manual, Arcana-paddhati, he was compiling for ISKCON. Srila Prabhupada told him, \u201cKeep it simple. The main process in Kali-yuga is the chanting of the holy names. You should always remember that.\u201d\nNow I will liquidate a debt. Abhimanyu Prabhu asked a question, and I owe him an answer. He asked me to speak about an incident when Srila Prabhupada had a disciple wake me up in the middle of the night. \nIt was in Vrndavana in Kartika of 1977, during Srila Prabhupada\u2019s last days with us. I was taking rest on the terrace on top of the gurukula building, and in the middle of the night\u2014 maybe midnight or one in the morning\u2014a devotee woke me up and said that Prabhupada wanted to see me. Srila Prabhupada\u2019s health was so delicate we thought he could leave at any time. So I rushed to Prabhupada\u2019s room, which is still preserved at the Krsna-Balarama temple, and found him lying silently on his bed. In a very soft voice (he was so weak he could hardly speak), he asked, \u201cSo, do you think this movement will go on after I leave?\u201d I replied, \u201cYes, as long as the devotees are sincere and chant their sixteen rounds and follow the regulative principles, the movement will be successful.\u201d Srila Prabhupada was silent for a moment. Then, with great difficulty, he spoke again. Especially considering that whatever he said might be his last words, I strained intently to hear. He uttered one word: \u201cOrganization.\u201d He paused and then whispered, \u201cOrganization and intelligence.\u201d \nI was startled. Prabhupada\u2019s words were full of meaning, and they had a profound effect on me. Yes, I realized, we must be sincere and chant our sixteen rounds and follow the regulative principles, but we are meant to do more than just maintain our own spiritual lives. We are meant to preach, to expand the movement, increase the number of devotees, and to do that requires organization\u2014and intelligence. The endeavor to spread Krsna consciousness in an intelligent, organized way is real service to Srila Prabhupada and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. It is as much service as chanting the holy names and following the regulative principles.\nThen Srila Prabhupada said, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\u2014was there anything else I wanted to say? Within my heart I was crying out, \u201cSrila Prabhupada, please stay with us; don\u2019t leave us.\u201d My heart was screaming, but in the prevalent mood of not wanting to impose our will on Srila Prabhupada, I simply said, \u201cNo,\u201d offered my obeisances, and left. Later I regretted not having expressed myself to him then.\nA very profound series of incidents took place around that time. As it was, Srila Prabhupada wasn\u2019t eating\u2014he wasn\u2019t able to digest\u2014but at one stage he also stopped drinking. Earlier, he had said that when his father had wanted to leave his body, he had just stopped eating and drinking. When Prabhupada refused to drink, his servant, a very nice, simple devotee, insisted, \u201cYou have to drink; otherwise you will become dehydrated.\u201d And Prabhupada said, \u201cYou want me to drink? Call the GBC.\u201d [laughter] In other words, the question of whether Prabhupada should drink or not was really a much deeper question: Should he try to stay alive in spite of all physical difficulties and discomfort, or was he free to go? It was, in a sense, a question of life or death.\nTamal Krishna and several other senior devotees went into Srila Prabhupada\u2019s room. \u201cIf I want to survive,\u201d Prabhupada said, \u201cof course I\u2019ll have to take something. It is not possible to survive without taking any food. But my survival means so many inconveniences, one after another. Therefore I have decided to die peacefully.\u201d Brahmananda, in the mood to encourage Prabhupada, said in effect, \u201cYes, Srila Prabhupada, the movement will still go on.\u201d And Prabhupada replied, \u201cThen let me die peacefully.\u201d The whole mood, based on the way Srila Prabhupada had been speaking, had been, \u201cWhatever Krsna wants.\u201d Earlier, when some disciples had asked, \u201cYou said that your guru maharaja left this world early because he was disgusted with his disciples\u2014is that the case now with you and us?\u201d Prabhupada had replied, \u201cNo, if Krsna allows me, I will be very happy to stay in your association.\u201d That had been the mood: \u201cWhatever Krsna desires\u2014whatever Krsna allows.\u201d Now, in the gathering of senior men, Srila Prabhupada stunned everyone with a statement that seemed markedly different from everything before. When Tamal Krishna said, \u201cEverything is in the hands of Krsna,\u201d Prabhupada suddenly opened his eyes and said, \u201cKrsna has given me the choice. Krsna has given me full freedom.\u201d \nTamal Krishna asked to be excused, and he and all the available senior men met in the anteroom. Kirtanananda Swami was clear and lucid: \u201cIf Krsna is giving Srila Prabhupada the choice and if Srila Prabhupada is giving us the choice, then we should ask him to stay.\u201d And the devotees became very enlivened: \u201cYes, we want Srila Prabhupada to finish Srimad-Bhagavatam and then translate so many other books. And we want Srila Prabhupada to lead the movement.\u201d When someone said, \u201cNot all the GBC members are here,\u201d Brahmananda responded, \u201cGet out of here! What GBC man is going to say we shouldn\u2019t ask Prabhupada to stay?\u201d So it was concluded, we wanted Prabhupada to stay and we would ask him.\nWe all went back into Srila Prabhupada\u2019s room. Kirtanananda Swami, as the seniormost disciple, had been chosen to speak on behalf of the others. Srila Prabhupada said, \u201cSo, what do you want?\u201d Kirtanananda couldn\u2019t speak. He just broke down, sobbing. Brahmananda, sitting just behind him, rubbed his back to encourage and support him. Through his tears and with a choked voice, Kirtanananda said, \u201cIf Krsna gives you the choice, then don\u2019t go. We need you.\u201d \u201cThis is your joint decision?\u201d Prabhupada asked. \u201cYou all have discussed?\u201d And Brahmananda spoke up, \u201cYes, we have all met together, Srila Prabhupada. We want you to remain with us and lead this movement and finish Srimad-Bhagavatam.\u201d\nSrila Prabhupada was quiet. He was deliberating what to do. For us, it was as if time stood still as we waited in suspense to hear Srila Prabhupada\u2019s response. Then, with his eyes still closed, he yawned, a really big yawn, and as he exhaled, \u201cAll right.\u201d [laughter] It was the most nonchalant decision on life or death. And then he asked for grape juice. The devotees were jubilant. Prabhupada was staying!\nIn November, just before Govardhana-puja, Srila Prabhupada announced that he wanted to go on parikrama on a bullock cart, and he asked Lokanath Swami to arrange it, which Maharaja promptly and enthusiastically proceeded to do. But some of the other senior devotees, especially those personally caring for Srila Prabhupada, thought that Prabhupada wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the journey. Even if the cart were padded with mattresses, they reasoned, the roads were so bumpy that Prabhupada would be jostled, and Prabhupada\u2019s condition was so delicate\u2014he was hardly eating or drinking and was practically just skin and bones\u2014he would be severely hurt by the shocks. But Srila Prabhupada seemed determined to go. And the intimate disciples who were serving him were in great anxiety.\nThe evening before Srila Prabhupada\u2019s intended departure, Niskincana Krsnadasa Babaji Maharaja came to visit, and one servant, Bhakti Charu Swami, asked him to prevail upon Srila Prabhupada not to go. Meanwhile, Tamal Krishna Goswami and Bhavananda, who had been talking upstairs, suddenly came to Prabhupada\u2019s bed. They were in tears and beside themselves in anxiety. \nPrabhupada understood: \u201cYou request me not to go?\u201d \nTamal Krishna replied, \u201cSrila Prabhupada, I was so upset. Two devotees told me that the road is so bad that you will be jolted back and forth. If anybody wants you to travel, I do. But why when you are in this condition? Why tomorrow?\u201d \n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Srila Prabhupada, agreeing to their request. \u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d\n\u201cNow I am,\u201d said Bhavananda. \u201cYes. I was in too much anxiety.\u201d \nThen Prabhupada turned to Babaji Maharaja and said, \u201cJust see how much they love me.\u201d\nAlthough Srila Prabhupada had been very insistent that he wanted to go and it was very hard to overcome the barriers of awe and reverence, in the end the disciples broke through those barriers and expressed their heartfelt desires to him, and Prabhupada responded, \u201cJust see how much they love me.\u201d\nThis is, in a way, a higher, more spontaneous level of Krsna consciousness. Of course, we always accept the authority and decision of the spiritual master. But we may, on occasion, express our different thoughts and feelings to him, and that may please him more.\nI began with the story of Gurudasa glorifying Dinanatha and then stopping himself because he was praising someone in front of the Deity, and Srila Prabhupada responding, \u201cKrsna is already glorified. But He takes more pleasure when his devotee is glorified.\u201d Even though the rule is there\u2014one should not praise someone before the Deity\u2014Srila Prabhupada knew Krsna\u2019s heart, that Krsna is more pleased when His devotee is glorified. So, in the end also, the rule was there\u2014one must obey the order of the spiritual master\u2014and Srila Prabhupada said, \u201cPrepare the bullock cart. I want to go on parikrama,\u201d but some of the disciples broke through the barriers of awe and reverence and expressed their heartfelt feelings and desires to him. And Prabhupada accepted their desire and agreed not to go. \u201cI shall not put you in anxiety,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall do what you like.\u201d Thus, one could say, he was bound by their love. \nThis seemed especially appropriate in the month of Kartika, Damodara, when we remember the pastime of Lord Damodara being bound by His mother\u2019s ropes. Actually, He was not bound by her ropes; He was bound by her love. As we sing daily in Kartika:\nrudantam muhur netra-yugmam mrjantam\n karambhoja-yugmena satanka-netram\nmuhuh svasa-kampa-trirekhanka-kantha-\n sthita-graivam damodaram bhakti-baddham\n\u201c[Seeing the whipping stick in His mother\u2019s hand,] He is crying and rubbing His eyes again and again with His two lotus hands. His eyes are filled with fear, and the necklace of pearls around His neck, which is marked with three lines like a conchshell, is shaking because of His quick breathing due to crying. To this Supreme Lord, Sri Damodara, whose belly is bound not with ropes but with His mother\u2019s pure love, I offer my humble obeisances.\nitidrk sva-lilabhir ananda-kunde\n sva-ghosam nimajjantam akhyapayantam\ntadiyesita-jnesu bhaktair jitatvam\n punah prematas tam satavrtti vande\n\u201cBy such childhood pastimes as this He is drowning the inhabitants of Gokula in pools of ecstasy, and is revealing to those devotees who are absorbed in knowledge of His supreme majesty and opulence that He is conquered only by devotees whose pure love is imbued with intimacy and is free from all conceptions of awe and reverence. With great love I again offer my obeisances to Lord Damodara hundreds and hundreds of times.\u201d (Damodarastaka 2\u20133)\nSimilarly, it seemed that Srila Prabhupada had been bound by his disciples\u2019 love, and so he stayed for some days more upon their request.\nNow, it is quite apparent to me that there is a lot of binding with ropes of love in Ukraine [applause]. His Holiness Niranjana Swami is bound by the ropes of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s love, and you all are being bound by the ropes of Niranjana Swami\u2019s love [applause]. This is the chain of disciplic succession, which begins with Krsna. Everyone is being bound by ropes of love and is being pulled back home, back to Godhead. \nSrila Prabhupada ki jaya!\nHis Holiness Niranjana Swami Maharaja ki jaya! \nHare Krsna.\n","nid":"1413"},{

I thought it would be appropriate to speak about this because last week we observed the 50th anniversary of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s acceptance of the renounced order of life. Srila Prabhupada accepted the renounced order of life in 1959. Therefore this year we are observing the 50th anniversary of his acceptance of sannyasa on the same day as Vishvarupa mahotsava. It is called Vishvarupa mahotsava because Srila Prabhupada accepted the renounced order on the same day that Lord Caitanya\u2019s brother, Vishvarupa, accepted the renounced order of life.\nSo we thought we would speak a little bit about this topic today as a humble attempt to glorify Srila Prabhupada. What does his acceptance of renounced order actually means for all of us? It was certainly a very relevant event in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s life, because he took it as an order coming directly from his spiritual master to take sannyasa, in order to go out and to preach the message of Krsna consciousness. Of course, we all know that he got that order in 1922, not in 1959. So 1922 was Srila Prabhupada\u2019s first meeting with Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura.\nI think it was last year that Srutakirti Prabhu mentioned this in one of his morning classes. He was quoting one conversation with Srila Prabhupada. The devotee speaking with Srila Prabhupada was saying how it seemed that every 11 years something very significant happened in Prabhupada\u2019s life.\nThen Prabhupada said, \"Yes. In 1922 I met my spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami Maharaja. In 1933 I took initiation from him. In 1944 I began 'Back to Godhead' magazine. In 1955 is when I left my family life. And in 1966 ISKCON was incorporated in America.\" So this conversation took place, I believe, in the early 1970\u2019s. \nSo the devotee asked Srila Prabhupada, \"Therefore 1977 will also be a very significant year, won\u2019t it?\"\nSrila Prabhupada said, \"Yes, perhaps significant. 1977 will be also a very relevant year.\"\nAnd I believe the devotee was quoted as saying, \"Maybe that will be a year to finish Srimad Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada?\"\nAnd Prabhupada said, \"Yes, maybe.\" And the conversation was finished.\nWe know that 1977 was the year when Srila Prabhupada departed from our vision and entered into Krsna\u2019s eternal lila. It was certainly a significant year in that Srila Prabhupada entered into Krsna\u2019s eternal pastimes and entered into Goloka Vrndavana. But for us, of course, who were left to remain here on this planet, 1977 was a very difficult year. We were left to break our heads against the stone, as Srila Narottama das Thakura described in his song for departed Vaishnavas, out of separation from the departed Vaishnava.\nAnyways, the conversation was specifically in reference to something significant happening in Srila Prabhupada's life every 11 years. \nAs we know, in 1922 Srila Prabhupada had his first meeting with Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. It took place in Ultadanga Road in Kolkata. At that time, his friend, his name was Narendranath Mullik, forced Srila Prabhupada to go and meet this very saintly person. He wanted Prabhupada to go begging him, \"Please, please, come. You must meet this very saintly man.\" \nSrila Prabhupada used to say that in his youth he was very influential person, and when he would do something many of his friends would follow his example. So Narendranath, knowing that, thought that if he brought Srila Prabhupada to visit this saintly person, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, then many other friends would also want go to see this saintly person. \nSo, as we know, this was the year when Prabhupada had that first meeting when Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura defeated Srila Prabhupada with his arguments about Caitanya Mahaprabhu\u2019s mission. But what was most significant is that when Prabhupada and his friend Narendranath came onto the rooftop, and they bowed down to offer their obeisances to the saintly person, as they understood this is a responsibility to do in the presence of the saintly person, as soon as they got up from offering their obeisances, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta immediately gave Srila Prabhupada his life's mission. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta said, \"You look like intelligent men. Why don\u2019t you take up the mission of Caitanya Mahaprabhu and preach His message of Krsna consciousness in English in the West?\"\nPrabhupada hadn\u2019t even heard anything from him yet - all he had done was offer his obeisances and already Prabhupada had his order, his life\u2019s mission, given to him by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta after just simply offering his obeisances to Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. \nSo, as we said before, the year 1959 is significant to us because it\u2019s when Srila Prabhupada wholeheartedly accepted the renounced order of life, and from that, the opportunity to facilitate and fulfill the execution of that order. Accepting the renounced order of life is not simply a matter of changing dress, but is a matter of consciousness.\nThere is a verse in the Srimad Bhagavatam, \nmayy ananyena bhavenabhakti\u1e3f kurvanti ye drdham\n\"Such a sadhu engages in staunch devotional service to the Lord without deviation. For the sake of the Lord he renounces all other connections, such as family relationships and friendly acquaintances within the world.\" [Srimad Bhagavatam 3.25.22]\nThis verse of Lord Kapiladeva from the Third Canto of the Bhagavatam is describing the characteristics of a sadhu. So Srila Prabhupada also - the way we understand, his taking of sannyasa - was very relevant to that verse. Although, as we will soon hear, he actually gave up his family even before he accepted sannyasa. But his acceptance of sannyasa was when that drdha\u2013vrata, that unflinching commitment in his heart to execute and to fulfill that order that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta gave him in 1922 \u2013 really fructified. \nAs we know, prior to that, Srila Prabhupada was a householder. He had many children. He had family responsibilities. He never really lived in any of the Gaudiya Mathas, although he certainly was assisting his sannyasi Godbrothers in various ways, helping them to spread Krsna consciousness as householder. In fact there was a time, some time in 1940\u2019s, when Srila Prabhupada was in Bombay and he was assisting his Godbrother Bhakti Raksaka Sridhar Maharaja, who was opening a temple in Bombay. There were two sanyassis: Bhakti Saranga Maharaja and Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Maharaja. Srila Prabhupada helped them by organizing different programs for them so that they could go out to raise funds for establishing a temple in Bombay. He was organizing all the programs for them and was facilitating their preaching.\nOne of his Godbrothers suggested to Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, \"He is such a very good organizer, a very good manager. Why don\u2019t we make him the temple president of the Matha here in Bombay?\" Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura replied, \"No. He will do everything in due course of time.\" Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura knew that Prabhupada had embraced in his heart the order given to him. He knew that everything in due course of time will manifest.\nPrabhupada would oftentimes speak about how Srila Bhaktisiddhanta had marked him as somebody who would accomplish something very wonderful because he hears very nicely. \"He is always very anxious to hear,\" he would say.\nIn fact, one time Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur was taking a parikrama around Vrndavana. Srila Prabhupada decided to leave Allahabad to go to Koshi, where Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur was speaking on that particular day. There was a temple nearby, it was the Shesashayi temple, and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta had suggested to those who wanted to go take darshan at the Shesashayi temple, they could go. But he was also going to be speaking that evening.\nMany of the devotees who were on the parikrama went to take darshan of the Deity in the Shesashayi temple, leaving behind a small number of devotees. Prabhupada said there were about 12 devotees that remained to listen to Srila Bhaktisiddhanta give his lecture that evening. Prabhupada was one of them. Prabhupada said, \"No, I am not going anywhere. I want to stay here. I want to hear my Guru Maharaja.\" \nPrabhupada had said in 1968 to a group of young devotees in Columbus, Ohio that at that time Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur took notice of Srila Prabhupada and said, \"Yes, he likes to hear\". In that same 1968 discussion Prabhupada continued, \"When one hears nicely, then he will preach nicely. First there must be hearing. Therefore we must be very, very eager to hear\", and he gave the example how he was very eager to hear Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in Koshi when he was on parikrama. And then he said, \"When one is hearing very nicely, then the very natural thing that will come after this is he will want to preach and tell others about Krsna\".\nSo Prabhupada was engaged in various ways, trying to assist his Godbrothers in spreading Krsna consciousness. As we said earlier\u2014 in 1944 Srila Prabhupada began the writing, publishing, printing, distributing \u2013 everything - \"Back to Godhead\" magazine. \nOf course, in the early days that was practically one of the only books that we had for distributing on sankirtana. Ladvamsi Prabhu I'm sure remembers in Boston, where we used to have our boxes of \"Back to Godhead\" magazines. Chandramauli Maharaja of course remembers this, also. Let me take this opportunity to introduce to all of you tonight His Holiness Chandramauli Maharaja, who is here for the first time at our festival.\n[Devotees loudly] Hariboool!!!\n[Guru Maharaja continues] We will introduce him tonight also, but I couldn\u2019t resist saying something about him now. He is a very good friend of mine. We travel together oftentimes throughout America. Chandramauli Maharaja would call me and ask me what my travel schedule is so that our paths could cross. We've had many substantial conversations in Krsna consciousness because he is very substantial person. And he loves to dance! [Guru Maharaja laughs] He is older than I am, but even though he is older, you wouldn\u2019t know that by the way that he dances. Please come and take this opportunity to see him dancing very enthusiastically during kirtans.\nBut I am sure he was also distributing \"Back to Godhead\" magazines in early 1970\u2019s. I remember my first time distributing \"Back to Godhead\". It was the same day I shaved my head. [Devotees laugh] There is a newspaper in Boston called the \"Boston Globe\". The Boston devotees gave me this shoulder bag that was used for distributing \"Boston Globe\" newspaper for carrying \"Back to Godhead\" magazines. \nSo, the day I finally got my head shaved. I had very long hair and we had no buzzers in those days. BUZZZZ [Guru Maharaja imitates sound of the buzzer] It was scissors and razors. So, it took the devotee who shaved me about 45 minutes to cut my hair. And then he had to shave me. And it looked like I just came off the battlefield. [Devotees laugh] There were marks all over my head. And they told me, \"Ok, now that you are shaved we can allow you to distribute 'Back to Godhead'\". [Devotees laugh]\nBut, the very first day I shaved my head I went on the streets distributing \"Back to Godhead\" with my Boston Globe newspaper bag. I wasn't told what to say. I wasn't told what to do. They filled up the bag and just said, \"Go distribute these magazines.\" I went completely alone. I was in the middle of this downtown where people were always walking back and forth, and I was just approaching people. I didn\u2019t know what to say, what to do. People were looking at me. The blood was still fresh on my head. People would look at me as if to ask, \"Where is he coming from?\" [Devotees laugh] Actually in was another city about 50 miles from Boston.\nPrabhupada said, \"In the early days of our Krsna consciousness, at first they will ridicule us, then they will persecute us, and then they will accept us.\" I think this was the \"ridicule\" stage - first day distributing \"Back to Godhead\", especially with all those scars on my head. But we had magazines that were coming from BBT in many boxes. Usually the boxes would be shipped by the BBT truck, or they would be sent by another form of shipment, and we would get maybe hundreds and hundreds of boxes of \"Back to Godhead\" magazines. \nBut Srila Prabhupada was doing everything. He was writing \"Back to Godhead\" magazine. He was purchasing the paper to print it, and he would take it personally to the printer. Sometimes he would not have enough money to pay to printer. And the printer would say, \"I\u2019ve already printed so many magazines for you.\" And Prabhupada would simply plead with them, \"Just print more. I will get the money in due course of time. I will pay all my debts back to you. Please print.\"\nSo, the printer couldn\u2019t refuse. He would accept Prabhupada\u2019s request and would print the magazines for him. Then Prabhupada would take these magazines and personally go out and distribute them. He would go to the tea stalls; he would go to the bazaars; visit people in their homes. One person was interviewed for the book that was written by a Godsister of mine. This person was saying that they knew every time when Prabhupada was coming with a new \"Back to Godhead\" magazine because they knew the sound of his bicycle. Prabhupada would go to many people and visit them with \"Back to Godhead\" magazines on a bicycle. He had this old, broken bicycle that every time he pedaled it would go SHEW, SHEW, SHEW [Guru Maharaja makes sounds of noisy bicycle] And people would know that he was coming by the sound of his bicycle. So this person who was interviewed said he knew every time a new \"Back to Godhead\" was coming by the sound of the bicycle coming in the distance. \nSo, Prabhupada was doing everything\u2014 finding paper, getting the magazine printed, published, and distributed. \nGradually Srila Prabhupada was already preparing to leave his family while serving Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura and assisting him in his preaching mission.\nSo we've spoken about the significance of 1922, 1933, and 1944. Nineteen fifty-five is around the time when Prabhupada left his family. Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Maharaja told a story how Prabhupada, when he was a householder, came to him in the middle of the night one night. It was 1:30 in the morning. Sometime in the mid 1950\u2019s. Prabhupada was pounding on the door where Sridhara Maharaja was staying. Sridhara Maharaja had been sleeping. He got up, opened the door, and Prabhupada was standing there. \nPrabhupada told him, \"Guru Maharaja came to me in the dream tonight. I am not ready for this. I am a little hesitant. But Guru Maharaja appeared and he told me, 'Please, you must take sannyasa.'\" Prabhupada immediately visited Sridhara Maharaja who was living very nearby at that time. Sridhara Maharaja said, \"Let me think about it. I am not sure I can do that right now.\"\nSridhara Maharaja had some connection with Prabhupada\u2019s wife\u2019s family. He knew all the family members. He was thinking, \"If I give him sannyasa. PHEW!\" [Devotees laugh] Because sannyasa means \"That\u2019s it!\" You just leave the family and leave everything behind for the sake of the service to the Lord. One must sever all connections, as we quoted in the verse earlier, \"such as family acquaintances and family relationships in this world.\"\nSo Prabhupada had that calling from Bhaktisiddhanta in a dream, not once, but it was many times. The second time, again at one o\u2019clock in the morning, Prabhupada was at Sridhara Maharaja\u2019s door. Prabhupada said, \"Guru Maharaja came to me again. He said, \u2018You must take sannyasa and preach.\u2019 Before I was hesitant, but now I am completely ready. Please give me sannyasa now!\" It was one o\u2019clock in the morning! Prabhupada just wanted that sannyasa. \nBut Sridhara Maharaja suggested, \"Why don\u2019t you first try living away from the family for a little while, and maybe later you can formally accept sannyasa?\" \nSo, again Srila Prabhupada didn\u2019t take sannyasa at that time. Even though Sridhara Maharaja didn\u2019t give him sannyasa, the very next day Prabhupada was gone. He just left everything behind. He was not to be found. Determination was there in his heart. He felt Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati calling him. \nOf course, it is very relevant that Prabhupada felt that call to take sannyasa to execute the order he received in 1922. Prabhupada had it fixed in his mind to execute that order, and that\u2019s what he wanted to do. He wanted to write and print books in English. He wanted to go to the West with books in English and to preach to the Western people. \nI want to read something very, very wonderful. Just a little bit. In 1958 Prabhupada wrote this poem called \"Vrndavana Bhajan\". This is a poem he wrote while he was in Vrndavana, and it was just before taking sannyasa. It is long, but I just want to read small section in it. He said,\n\"1. I am sitting alone in Vrindavana-dhama. In this mood I am getting many realizations. I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything, But I have no money so they are a fruitless glory. Krishna has shown me the naked form of material nature, By his strength it has all become tasteless to me today. Yasyaham anugrihnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih: \"I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful.\" How was I able to understand this mercy of the All-merciful?\n2. Everyone has abandoned me, seeing me as penniless, Wife, relatives, friends, brothers, everyone. This is misery, but it gives me a laugh. I sit alone and laugh. In this maya-samsara, whom do I really love? Where have all my loving father and mother gone to now? And where are all my elders, who were my own folk? Who will give me news of them, tell me who? All that is left of this family life is a list of names.\" [Vrindavan Bhajan poem, verses 1-2, by Srila Prabhupada, originally published Dec. 1958]\nThis is Prabhupada\u2019s realizations when he was sitting in Vrndavana. This is 1958 when Srila Prabhupada had already left his family. He is saying, \"Where are they? All that is left of them is simply a list of names.\" Then he just talks about how the soul is eternal. How relationships are established temporarily in this world. Then he says, \"But everyone is your relative, brother? On the spiritual platform.\" \nPrabhupada used to say that quite often about preaching Krsna consciousness. In fact in 1968 Prabhupada was speaking to a group of disciples in Seattle when he had received a message that Srila Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja, the Vaisnava who gave Srila Prabhupada sannyasa, had departed from the world. Prabhupada was saying to the devotees at that time that he wanted to write a condolence letter to all the disciples of Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja. He also told his disciples how Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was again speaking through Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja to accept sannyasa.\nPrabhupada described in that conversation how he was thinking when Srila Bhaktisiddhanta appeared in his dream requesting him to take sannyasa, \"O, horrible! Sannyasa! Giving up family, giving up formal connection with all family.\" He said, \"But anyone who gives up anything for Krsna, never loses. I gave up my children, but now I have many children. When you give something to Krsna, you never lose. You are always the gainer.\"\nBy the way, this is not a lecture about telling everybody to take sannyasa. [Guru Maharaja and devotees laugh] We are glorifying Prabhupada\u2019s sannyasa and how Prabhupada felt that rising urge in his heart to execute the order of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta and how he saw sannyasa as the facility for executing that order. So, certainly that is connected to us in some way. It does not mean that all of us are going to just leave our family members, saying, \"Well, Niranjana Swami spoke about the importance of taking sannyasa today.\"\nAs we said, sannyasa is not just a change of dress. It's the consummation of an evolution of consciousness, and that\u2019s what we described that took place in Srila Prabhupada. Of course, his consciousness was always completely Krsna consciousness. And Prabhupada told us that never was there a time when he forgot Krsna. But still he set an important example to follow. That important example is to accept the order of the spiritual master, and no matter how troublesome it may be to execute that order, one must go on, no matter how many years it takes to carry out that order. In due course of time Krsna will facilitate the fulfillment of that order in the heart of a sincere disciple.\nSo, it was in 1958 that Prabhupada wrote this \"Vrndavan Bhajan\". There is a very interesting verse at the very end of \"Vrndavana Bhajan\". It really gives us the essence of what Prabhupada's bhajan in Vrndavan was. Sometimes we think Vrndavan bhajan means we go to Vrndavana to meditate on the pastimes of Radha and Krsna and the pastimes of the residents of Vrndavana, to try to absorb our mind and consciousness in transcendental lilas of Goloka Vrndavana. Actually, it is true. That is Vrndavan bhajan. \nBut one who engages in that Vrndavan bhajan while realizaing the necessity of executing the order of one's spiritual master, sees things from that perspective. So he said,\n\"26. Sri Dayita dasa prabhu gave this instruction.\"\nWhat was the instruction? It was in a previous verse: \"Always preach! From jiva's door to door Your life will be successful as a result of your preaching.\"\n[Guru Maharaja continues reading verse 26] \"26. Sri Dayita dasa prabhu gave this instruction. Chant Hare Krishna loudly, this is my initiation: Kirtana is not just drums and karatalas. The sound of kirtana is not this modern system. Anything favourable for devotional service is all Madhava. And the only enjoyer of the three worlds is Yadava. Maya's pride and joy, the radio sound. Destroy them all by forceful kirtana.\nHe is talking about radio. During this time everybody was listening to radio. Radio was everything. The entire family, instead of sitting in front of computer screen and playing computer games on X-Box or anything like that, they were all sitting around the radio. So Prabhupada said, \"Maya\u2019s pride and joy is the sound of the radio.\"\n27. Maya's is all these newspapers. Preach that throughout the whole world. Sitting alone in your room shouting, you may increase your bile's secretion. But in ten million births Sri Hari won't be pleased. Sri Hari is no one's father's property. Come out of your cage, stop making objection. Everything belongs to Sri Hari and Sri Hari belongs to everyone. Chant the Hare Krishna mantra loudly. By the performance of such sankirtana there will come remembrance automatically. Then there will be nirjana bhajana manifested in the heart spontaneously. [Vrindavan Bhajan poem, verses 26-27, by Srila Prabhupada, originally published Dec. 1958]\nThat was the end of Prabhupada\u2019s \"Vrndavana Bhajan\". He wrote it in 1958. So, in 1958 he was preparing himself for sannyasa. And in April, 1959 he wrote a letter to his Godbrother Bhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj in Kolkata. In Kolkata was a big Gaudiya Matha temple, the Bag-Bazar Temple. At that time there was a dispute amongst the members of the Gaudiya Matha as to who was actually the real Gaudiya Matha. Bhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj held the legal documents for Gaudiya Matha at that time. \nSo, Srila Prabhupada was thinking, \"If I write to Bhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj, if he is representing the Gaudiya Matha, certainly he will help me fulfill Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada\u2019s order.\"\nSo he wrote a letter to Bhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj, \"Please help me fulfill the order of Guru Maharaja. Guru Maharaja wants his institution Gaudiya Matha to spread throughout the world in English-speaking language. Please facilitate this, by giving me sannyasa and sponsoring me, so that I can go to America. Help me publish books in the English language so that I can take these books to America and preach there.\"\nBhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj wrote back a letter to Prabhupada saying, \"First you should become member of our society. Come and live in the temple, do some service, become a servant of the Vaishnavas, you\u2019ll see others taking sannyasa and in due course of time you can take sannyasa also.\" \nIn another words, he wanted Prabhupada to become an official member of the Bag-Bazar Gaudiya Matha temple and to live in the temple. \"We will give you a very nice room that is very nicely lit and has good air. You can work there and write for our temple.\" So, what Bhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj was saying was that \"become a member of our temple, live in our temple, become a humble servant in our temple and in due course of time sannyasa will come.\"\nPrabhupada received that letter, and then he decided in May of the same year, 1959, to write a second letter to Bhaktivillas Tirtha Maharaja. In that letter Prabhupada was emphasizing that now was the time to execute the order of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. Prabhupada was using all the arguments that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura used to defeat him in 1922, when Prabhupada said, \"How will people hear our message if we are not an independent nation?\" If you remember, in 1922 Prabhupada was a member of Gandhi\u2019s movement, and when Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura told Prabhupada to take this message to the West, Prabhupada offered the argument, \"Who will hear our message? We are not even an independent nation. We are subjugated by British rule.\"\nBut Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura right in that meeting defeated Srila Prabhupada. He said, \"Political sides can always go from one side to the other - things are always changing in this world. But there is one thing that will never change and that is the message of Caitanya Mahaprabhu - that is absolute. His message must be spread now and it is an emergency.\" \nSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur explained how propagating the message of Caitanya Mahaprabhu throughout the whole world was more important than getting liberated from British rule. He established the importance of taking this message throughout the world, especially in English-speaking language. Why English? Because it was the language of the world.\nSo Srila Prabhupada wrote another letter presenting all these arguments to Bhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj, \"Please facilitate me. Please allow me to come to you to accept the renounced order of life. Facilitate this order of our Guru Maharaja. Sponsor me and allow me to go to the West and help me print books in English-speaking language.\"\nBhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj wrote back a letter again saying pretty much the same message, \"We have so many books that are given to us as a priority by our Guru Maharaja to print. We still have to print so many other books. You can come and help us edit these books and help us write these books. And in due course of time we may help you to print books in English language. But now there are more important things to be done.\"\nSo Prabhupada received that reply from Bhaktivilas Tirtha Maharaj, but in his heart he couldn\u2019t neglect the order that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura had given to him. He felt that over-flooding in his heart, that desire to execute that order.\nThere is a nice story in this connection. I would like to mention this story because it very nicely exemplifies Prabhupada\u2019s intense desire. I am sure many of you might have heard this story before, but it is relevant, so I will repeat it for the benefit of glorifying our beloved Srila Prabhupada. I think it was in 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s, when Prabhupada used to go to Advaita Acarya\u2019s house in Shantipura. He would go there, sit, and he would chant his japa in the back. \nThere was one pujari who had noticed Prabhupada, who was in white cloth at the time. Prabhupada would come once maybe every 2 months and sit there, and he would chant very intently. At some time the pujari noticed that Prabhupada was sitting and chanting, and then he was crying. Then there was a period of time when Prabhupada stopped going to that place. The pujari didn\u2019t see him for many years. I think about ten years had passed that Prabhupada hadn\u2019t come to that place. \nThen one day this pujari looked in the back, and he saw this man sitting there - and he recognized him. It was the same man that was coming 10-15-20 years prior. He was sitting and chanting japa, but this time he was wearing saffron cloth and he was holding a danda. The pujari decided to approach the pilgrim this time. He was thinking, \"I haven\u2019t seen this person for so long. I want to talk to him and ask him who he is.\" So the pujari asked, \"What is your name, kind sir?\" \nPrabhupada replied, \"I am a menial servant of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami Thakura. My name is A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.\" And at that time tears were just flooding Prabhupada\u2019s eyes, as he was sitting and chanting. \nThe pujari said, \"I remember, you used to come before. You would sit and chant japa. Why are you crying like this?\" \nPrabhupada replied, \"I am crying because tomorrow I am leaving to execute an impossible instruction of my spiritual master. My spiritual master is giving me a virtually impossible instruction to execute \u2013 to go to the West and to preach Krsna consciousness to the Western people, and to make Westerners into Vaishnavas. Therefore, I am crying to all the personalities who used to gather at this great holy place: Advaita Acarya, Lord Nityananda, Haridasa Thakura, Lord Caitanya - and crying to all of Them begging Them to please give me Their blessings, give me Their mercy so that I may fulfill this order of my Guru Maharaja.\" \nThen Prabhupada bowed down to the feet of the pujari and said, \"I am also begging, please give me your blessings, too.\"\nPrabhupada chanted for a little while longer, and then he left. That was the day before he boarded the Jaladuta. \nMany years later, many Western people dressed as Vaishnavas were coming and visiting Advaita Acarya\u2019s house. One of the Westerners in Vaishnava dress handed the pujari a \"Back to Godhead\" magazine. The devotee then left. \nThe pujari took the \"Back to Godhead\" magazine and opened it up - and immediately he saw a picture of Prabhupada. \"That\u2019s the same man!\" He continued looking inside the magazine and found the address of the closest temple - it was around 1980 - and he came to Mayapura to the temple. He just wanted to speak and he was just overwhelming, bubbling, he wanted to tell everybody the story. He said, \"You see this picture? This man is Bhaktivedanta Swami. Now I understand! Now I realize why I've seen so many people, Westerners, coming in Vaishnava dress! He\u2019s done it! He\u2019s done it! He\u2019s done it!\"\nThe devotees were saying, \"What? What? What are you saying?\"\nAnd then he told them the whole story how Prabhupada used to come to the house of Advaita Acarya, he would sit, chant, and cry, and then he described the last time he had come before going to the West. When he read the magazine, he immediately had the answer to his minds question, \"Why are all these people, Westerners, coming dressed in Vaishnava cloth?\" He realized, \"Bhaktivedanta Swami went to the West and executed that impossible order.\" So he said, \"I just had to come here and tell you this story.\" \nThe devotees, of course, were just overwhelmed after hearing this story.\nOf course, that event between the pujari and Srila Prabhupada in Shantipura took place just before Prabhupada left on Jaladuta.\nBut in 1959, after he had written that letter to Bhaktivilasa Tirtha Maharaja, Prabhupada decided that he would approach Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja asking for his blessings to accept sannyasa. Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja replied, \"You must accept sannyasa. You must! Yes! You should do it immediately.\" \nPrabhupada had told one story in 1968. When he heard Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja had departed from this world, he offered a prayer and he recited one verse to send his condolences for the departure of his beloved Godbrother. (Prabhupada said Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was speaking through him when he ordered him that he must take sannyasa.) Prabhupada composed a verse in glorification of Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja and asked all his disciples to sign it. He wanted to send the letter immediately to India to offer condolences for the departure of Kesava Maharaja.\nSo, Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja was so emphatic that Srila Prabhupada should immediately take sannyasa that he didn\u2019t even take time to make a schedule for the event. He said, \"Very soon is the Vishvarupa Mahotsava, the day that Vishvarupa took sannyasa. That is very auspicious day. You should take sannyasa on that day.\"\nSo, there were no invitations written. There was no big event. Nothing. They just picked that day as an auspicious day when Prabhupada would taking sannyasa. There was one Godbrother, I think his name was Sanatana Das, who became Muni Maharaja, who also took sannyasa on that day. \nSo this is also a very relevant point that I will now tell you. As we said, there were no invitations. The only people who were present were just the brahmacaris in the Matha and a few guests. And they were also from Bengal and did not understand English. So during the sannyasa ceremony, Srila Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja delivered a short talk in Bengali and then said to Prabhupada, \"Now you speak. You give a lecture.\" \nPrabhupada immediately began giving a lecture, but he spoke the entire lecture in English. Nobody understood. The only ones who were present who understood English at that time were Narayana Maharaja (who performed yajna), Bhaktiprajnana Kesava Maharaja and Krsna das Babaji Maharaja. Krsna das Babaji Maharaja was a very close friend of Srila Prabhupada. Nobody else present understood a word of English.\nJust to establish the point why he was taking sannyasa, Prabhupada delivered the whole lecture to everyone in English, even though nobody else understood what he was saying, because he knew that English was the language of the world and it was the order that he was given by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta to preach in that language.\nAlso one very interesting event happened during that sannyasa ceremony. Everybody who knew Krsnadas Babaji Maharaja, knew that he and Srila Prabhupada were close friends. Babaji Maharaja used to always come to see Srila Prabhupada in Vrndavana. They would sit and talk and laugh. They would sit on the bed and discuss krsna katha for hours. They had so much affection for each other. \nBabaji Maharaja was loved throughout the whole Gaudiya Matha. At that time in the Gaudiya Matha there was a lot of friction between temples. They were fighting to determine who was going to be next acarya. Some times when a sannyasi would go to another Matha, he would not be allowed to come in to speak. But Babaji Maharaja was such a non-political person. The only thing he did everywhere he went was chant Hare Krsna. \nAs soon as he would walk into any Gaudiya Matha temple, they would immediately take mrdanga, put it over his shoulder and say, \"Please lead kirtan.\" And Babaji Maharaja would just start leading kirtan, and everybody would follow in complete bliss. He was a very non-political person, so attached to the Holy Name of the Lord.\nSo during the sannyasa ceremony, Babaji Maharaja was sitting there and was very enthusiastically chanting \"Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna\u2026\" So happy to see his Godbrother taking sannyasa. One Vaishnava said to Babaji Maharaja, \"Shhh. Don\u2019t chant so loudly.\"\nWhen Prabhupada saw that, he immediately turned to Babaji Maharaja and said, \"Chant louder! Louder! Louder!\" [Devotees laugh] Babaji Maharaja told some of Prabhupada\u2019s disciples about this some time much later. He said, \"When Prabhupada said that, I knew that this is the person was going to take the Holy Name and spread it throughout the world. This person has such firm faith in the Holy Name. He is going to spread the glories of the Holy Name of the Lord.\"\nSo it was then that Srila Prabhupada took sannyasa. The rest of story, we know what happened. Everything else is known. The history is known, what Prabhupada\u2019s sannyasa means to us.\nSo, this is a very glorious day. Of course it is not today, but it was last week. This is the 50th anniversary of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s acceptance of renounced order of life. And we simply, humbly offer this offering, these words of glorification at his lotus feet, and we beg that we can all simply follow in his footsteps, and make this Krsna consciousness our life and soul, as he wanted all of us to do.\nThank you very much.\n[Devotees loudly clapping hands for long time] Hariboooool!\n[Devotee] Srila Niranjana Swami Maharaja ki Jay!

"title":"Prabhupada Memories #2 - His Holiness Giriraja Swami - Kiev - January 8, 2010","ref":{"target_id":"992"},"attachment":"","tags":["Giriraja Swami","Prabhupada Memories","Transcriptions"],"date":"Mon, 2010-03-29 11:30","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"Prabhupada Memories \u2014 \nGiriraj Swami\nJanuary 8, 2010\nKiev\n\nSeeing so many new faces tonight, I thought to speak a bit more about how I first met Srila Prabhupada and the devotees and how I was saved by his mercy and engaged in his service. \nAs I mentioned last night, I was seeking perfect happiness, and I got the idea that to attain perfect happiness I should follow some form of Eastern mystical practice\u2014and then I understood that to realize spiritual perfection I needed a guru. So my whole focus became how to find my guru. I even got the idea that I wouldn\u2019t actually have to choose my guru but that my guru was already there and I just had to find him. I even had a mental impression of what my guru looked like. He didn\u2019t have hair. All the svamis and yogis who came from India to America then had long hair and beards. So I was becoming hopeless: \u201cHow will I find my perfect master?\u201d \nThen Srila Prabhupada spoke at my university near Boston, but I didn\u2019t have a chance to talk with him personally. So I went to the old Boston temple and heard Srila Prabhupada speak there. After the lecture, Srila Prabhupada asked for questions, and I asked him the question that was burning within my heart: \u201cThere are so many svamis and yogis and masters, and each teaches a different method of spiritual realization, and each says that his is the best. So how do I know which is the best?\u201d Srila Prabhupada replied in a most intelligent way. He asked, \u201cWhat is your goal?\u201d\u2014because one will choose the method that is best for achieving one\u2019s goal. \u201cDo you want to become God, or do you want to serve God?\u201d\nUntil then, all the svamis and yogis whom I had met had taught that you can become God, or one with God. \u201cSo,\u201d Prabhupada said, \u201cwhat is your goal? Do you want to serve God, or do you want to become God? If you want to become God, it means that you are not God now, and how can not-God become God?\u201d He said, \u201cGod is God. He is always God. He doesn\u2019t have to become God by yoga or meditation. Krsna is God. He is God when He is playing on the lap of His mother. He is God when He is fighting on the field of Kuruksetra. He is always God. He doesn\u2019t have to become God.\u201d \nThen Srila Prabhupada said, \u201cIf you sow the seed of service to God and water it by chanting, God will provide the sunlight and air and all other conditions to make your service grow. But if you want to become God, why should God help the competition? God is in your heart. He is ready to help you. If you want to become God, you are only cheating yourself. You can become godly, but you cannot become God.\u201d \nThen Srila Prabhupada asked me directly, \u201cSo, do you want to serve God, or do you want to become God?\u201d At that time I got the distinct impression that Srila Prabhupada knew everything about me, that he could see right into me and through me. I felt that he was seeing beyond the walls of the temple down the roads to my apartment, seeing right into my apartment, into the bathroom where I had placed on the wall a sign that I had engraved in my own hand in ornate lettering in different colors. The sign read, \u201cYou are god.\u201d [laughter] I felt that Srila Prabhupada was seeing that sign on my wall, and he was asking me, \u201cSo, do you want to serve God, or do you want to become God?\u201d But I felt ashamed, in front of so many people in the temple room, that I had the abominable desire to be God. I began to say, \u201cI want to serve God . . . ,\u201d but I knew I couldn\u2019t cheat Srila Prabhupada. I knew that he knew everything. So I said, \u201cI want to serve God, but actually I realize I wanted to become God.\u201d And Prabhupada said, \u201cYes.\u201d \nI had found my perfect master. I bowed my head to the floor in surrender. But it wasn\u2019t just surrender\u2014I was embarrassed that my sinful desire had been exposed in front of all the people in the temple, and I imagined that they would all be staring and glaring at me, \u201cOh, he wanted to become God.\u201d So I kept my head to the floor. Eventually I heard sounds that indicated that the atmosphere was changing. The devotees had brought a big plate of prasada for Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada looked at the plate and said, \u201cI am not God. I cannot eat all of this. Distribute.\u201d So the devotees were distributing prasada.\nFrom then on, I came every night to be with Srila Prabhupada. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening Srila Prabhupada would speak in the temple, and Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday he would speak outside, usually at a university. And on Sunday he would speak at the Sunday love feast.\nOne program outside the temple was at the International Student Association in Cambridge, Massachusetts, associated with Harvard University. Srila Prabhupada gave a beautiful talk that I still remember vividly. And from the very beginning I was intrigued and fascinated and impressed by the way he answered questions. \nAt the International Student Association an Indian man referred to the verse from the Bhagavad-gita (4.11), ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham, and proposed, \u201cKrsna says, \u2018All roads lead to Me. No matter what one does, no matter what one thinks, no matter what one is involved with, eventually he evolves toward Me.\u2019 Is that a natural evolution, or can it be influenced by external teaching? One may get there sooner than another, but in reality there may not be any control that one really has on this.\u201d And Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cNo, it requires teaching. Otherwise, why Krsna is teaching? If it is natural, then why would Krsna teach Arjuna? It is not natural. You have to select by getting knowledge from a superior person. Otherwise there is no meaning of Krsna\u2019s teaching Arjuna. Arjuna was perplexed. He could not understand whether he should fight or not. And that is the position of everyone. Everyone is perplexed. He requires guidance. Up to animal life it is natural, but in the human form of life there is discretion. As you like, you can make your choice. If you like Krsna, you can go to Krsna. If you like something else, you can go there. That is your discretion. Everyone has got independence, little independence. Krsna says at the end of the Bhagavad-gita (18.66), sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: \u2018Just surrender unto Me, giving up everything.\u2019 If it is natural, then why He should say, \u2018You should do this\u2019? It is not natural. One has to learn it. Therefore one requires a spiritual master like Krsna or His representative.\u201d\nEvery evening there was a program with Srila Prabhupada. There was the one at Harvard Divinity School, and one I think at Boston College. At the end of Prabhupada\u2019s talks there was always kirtana, but the kirtana at Boston College had an especially powerful effect on me. There were chairs toward the back of the classroom, where most of the students and staff were sitting, and then an open area where the devotees were dancing in a circle. As I was chanting and dancing in the circle, I felt an overwhelming feeling of love for all the people in the room, and from the room that feeling extended into the surrounding areas of Boston, across the United States, and through the universe. \nI\u2019d never had such an experience, and I was so overcome that after the kirtana I approached Srila Prabhupada. I\u2019d never approached him before, but being overwhelmed, I came up to the dais, where he was sitting on an elevated seat. As I came close to him, I felt I was entering a sphere of spiritual energy. I looked at Srila Prabhupada and said, \u201cThis chanting is wonderful.\u201d Srila Prabhupada began to chuckle, and his body was heaving. I knew he was feeling transcendental ecstasy. He looked at me in great happiness, his face broke into an expansive smile, and he said, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\nIn this way, two weeks passed. Then one day Srila Prabhupada and the devotees were getting ready to go somewhere. I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d The devotees said, \u201cSrila Prabhupada is leaving.\u201d I thought, \u201cSrila Prabhupada is leaving? Why is he leaving? Where is he going?\u201d I didn\u2019t know there was an ISKCON beyond the Boston temple. I asked if I could come to the airport, and the devotees said yes. \nAt the airport almost all the devotees were crying. Until then, I had been convinced that everything about Krsna consciousness was perfect: the spiritual master was perfect, the philosophy was perfect, the process of chanting was perfect, the spiritual food, prasada, was perfect\u2014everything was perfect. But then I thought, \u201cMaybe this is the defect: that Srila Prabhupada has to leave.\u201d Seeing all the devotees crying, I asked Arundhati, \u201cWhy are all the devotees crying?\u201d She replied, \u201cSrila Prabhupada said that in the spiritual world, on the absolute platform, meeting and separation are the same\u2014both are ecstasy.\u201d The answer sounded perfect, but some doubt remained in my mind whether it was practical.\nPrabhupada boarded the aircraft, but the devotees stayed fixed. They didn\u2019t move. Even after the airplane took off, they remained looking out the window at the plane. So I asked Arundhati, \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d She replied, \u201cSrila Prabhupada said that when the spiritual master leaves, we should look at the airplane until it disappears in the sky, just like the gopis watched Krsna\u2019s chariot when He left Vrndavana for Mathura, until it disappeared in the distance.\u201d\nI continued to associate with the devotees after Srila Prabhupada left, and soon thereafter I moved into the temple. But that doubt remained: \u201cMaybe this is the one defect in Krsna consciousness\u2014the spiritual master has to leave.\u201d \nOne day we were chanting in front of the Copley Square subway station, and somehow I felt Srila Prabhupada\u2019s presence in a most tangible way. I felt, \u201cYes, he is actually present. What the devotees said is true. On the absolute platform there is no difference between meeting and separation\u2014both are occasions of ecstasy.\u201d\nIn December Srila Prabhupada returned to Boston, after traveling to Columbus, New Vrindaban, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Hamburg, and London. In the meantime, we had purchased a three-story mansion, the first property owned by ISKCON, at 40 North Beacon Street, and Srila Prabhupada had said that the devotees with ISKCON Press should move and establish the press in there. Srila Prabhupada was so happy that we had our own press, on our own premises, that was printing his books. He took a tour of the press, saw all the different departments and equipment, and met the devotees who did all the different services, and he was very pleased. After he left, when the devotees were cleaning out his desk, they found a small handwritten note from him thanking some of the devotees (Brahmananda, Satsvarupa, Advaita, and Giriraj) for establishing the press there. He was really very, very eager that his books be published and distributed. But at the same time, he was concerned that the devotees maintain their spiritual lives. \nAfter Srila Prabhupada left Boston, for most of the next year, the leaders of the movement somehow became very focused on making money, and the devotees would have to leave the temple right after breakfast and stay out until late at night. We hardly had time to chant our rounds. There was no evening program. And we came back so late that it was hard to get up early in the morning. Srila Prabhupada was in Los Angeles and understood what was happening, so he introduced some measures to purify the movement. First, he said, the devotees should come back from sankirtana by five or six and have an evening program in the temple. Then they should take rest, rise early, and attend the morning program. Further, he didn\u2019t want the devotees to insist on a specific minimum amount for the magazines they were distributing. He said we should just give people the magazine and ask for a donation. He wanted us to depend on Krsna. He didn\u2019t want us to be too preoccupied with money. \nThere were also other incidents related to depending on Krsna. When I first joined the Boston temple, we didn\u2019t regularly go out on hari-nama-sankirtana and we hardly distributed any magazines or books. Still, by Srila Prabhupada\u2019s mercy and potency, devotees were joining. The only income we had then was Satsvarupa\u2019s paycheck from the welfare office where he worked as a social worker, but in time that became insufficient. So the devote[e]s had a meeting about what to do. All the devotees were very surrendered; they were ready to do whatever was required. Srila Prabhupada had said that devotees could get jobs if they needed, and so different devotees volunteered: \u201cI used to work in the post office; I can get a job in the post office.\u201d \u201cI know the grocer down the street; I can work in the grocery store.\u201d A devotee named Nanda-kisora raised his hand and quoted from a letter from Srila Prabhupada: \u201cIf you just go out on sankirtana all of your problems will be solved\u2014materially and spiritually.\u201d Prabhupada had even written, \u201cYou can close the temple to go out on sankirtana.\u201d So we all agreed, \u201cYes, we will try it. We will go out on sankirtana.\u201d\nThe next day, we went out to chant. We hardly had any magazines or books to distribute, but we held out conchshells and baskets and asked people to contribute. We came back to the temple at night and counted up the laksmi, and there were more than seven dollars. So we thought, \u201cThis is pretty good. Let\u2019s try again tomorrow.\u201d We went out again the next day, chanting, dancing, asking for donations, and giving people Back to Godheads. We came back and counted up, and there were twelve dollars. So we thought, \u201cThis is really good.\u201d We went out the third day and came back and counted up, and there were nineteen dollars. So we thought, \u201cYes, what Srila Prabhupada said is true: if we just do sankirtana, all of our problems will be solved\u2014materially and spiritually.\u201d\nLater, when we got the mansion on North Beacon Street, we had to make big mortgage payments every month, but we took the risk. We calculated that if we distributed so many Back to Godheads daily, we would be able to make our assigned quota and at the same time pay our mortgage. But the winter became so cold that the public shied away from the streets and we were unable to meet our quota\u2014and by the end of January we didn\u2019t have nearly enough money to make our mortgage payment, which was due on the following Monday, the first business day in February. So all the devotees felt very morose because it seemed inevitable that we would lose the property and all the money we had put into it. \nThat Sunday, after the program, a middle-aged lady\u2014we hardly got middle-aged visitors then; mainly just young people\u2014told us that she really liked the original paintings on the walls and that she wanted to buy some. The paintings were done by devotees\u2014many for the books and some just for the temple. She chose several and asked how much they would cost. We had no idea how much they were worth as art, but we gave a figure that was enough to cover the mortgage. She agreed and paid the amount, and so we were able to keep the temple.\nSrila Prabhupada had faith in the chanting of the holy names, he had faith in the potency of the sankirtana movement, and he was willing to take risks for the sake of spreading the Krsna consciousness movement, fulfilling the orders of his guru maharaja and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. And all of us, as we proceed in devotional service, are required to take risks. As long as we stay in our comfort zones, as long as we keep doing the things that are easy and comfortable for us, we will not be able to make significant advancement and we won\u2019t really feel guru and Krsna\u2019s mercy. This was a major theme in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s life. He took great risks to spread Krsna consciousness. He took personal risks, he took financial risks, and, in a way, he took risks by entrusting great responsibility to his young disciples. He was ready to give a devotee a chance to show what he or she could do. And because of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s love and trust in us, we wanted to rise to the occasion. We didn\u2019t want to disappoint him.\nOne incident that shows how a devotee can rise above his ordinary, conditioned nature for the sake of Srila Prabhupada took place in Bombay. It is not a story that I tell often. Srila Prabhupada had entered an agreement with Mr. Nair to purchase the Juhu land. That was another risk that Srila Prabhupada took, because we had no money to pay for the land. And Mr. Nair was not just a businessman; he was a crook. He had already entered an agreement to sell the same land to another party and on some pretext had cancelled the agreement and kept the other party\u2019s money. In a similar way, he tried to cheat Prabhupada. And as part of the whole intrigue, he accompanied me to meet our lawyer, who, it turned out, was in collusion with Nair to cheat us. \nMr. Nair took me to the city in his car. He was in the back seat on the right, I was in the middle, and he had arranged for a lady to sit next to me on my left. I didn\u2019t really want to sit next to a lady, but I was so intimidated by the whole situation\u2014I was new, and Mr. Nair was a very big man in Bombay\u2014that I just went along with it. Then this lady started to put her hand on my leg, on my upper leg, making her way upward. I didn\u2019t know what was going on, but I was getting agitated. I was only about twenty-three years old, and my mind and senses were going wild. It was building up to such a point that I was thinking, \u201cOh well, who cares? I will just give in.\u201d But then I thought, \u201cIf I do that, eventually the news will get out and our position as a movement will become very weak and Srila Prabhupada\u2019s mission will be compromised.\u201d And I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t hurt Srila Prabhupada in this way.\u201d So even though for myself, being so agitated by the lady, I was ready to throw caution to the wind, for the sake of Srila Prabhupada, I couldn\u2019t. Then I realized how powerful Srila Prabhupada\u2019s mercy was, that I actually loved him more than I loved myself, because in that state I was ready to do something that would have hurt me personally, but I wasn\u2019t prepared to do something that would hurt Srila Prabhupada. (Later I found out that the lady was a well-known prostitute in Juhu, and thereafter I was very careful to stay away from her, though she sometimes came to the Juhu land looking for me.) \nNow, there are two points. One is that Srila Prabhupada invested so much trust [in] and gave so much responsibility to his young disciples\u2014he was ready to take risks. And because he did invest so much love and trust in us, we wanted to rise to the occasion and not disappoint him. \nOf course, it is a long story\u2014Srila Prabhupada\u2019s struggle to acquire the Juhu land\u2014but in the end he was successful. \nOne evening, Srila Prabhupada was sitting on the terrace of one of the old tenement buildings that came with the land, and a devotee named Haridasa was fanning him. At seven o\u2019clock Prabhupada looked at his watch and said, \u201cHaridasa, do you hear the sound of kirtana in the temple?\u201d Haridasa strained to hear but couldn\u2019t. \u201cNo.\u201d Prabhupada said, \u201cYou don\u2019t hear the sound of kirtana in the temple?\u201d Haridasa strained to hear, but still, \u201cNo.\u201d And Prabhupada said, \u201cThat is the point. Where is the kirtana? Where are the devotees?\u201d Haridasa ventured, \u201cWell, they must have gone to the city to collect and not yet come back.\u201d And Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cThat was not my idea, that the devotees should go out and collect all day and night. They may go at nine in the morning and return at five in the evening and then chant and dance before the Deities. Otherwise they will become like karmis. \nThen Srila Prabhupada asked Haridasa, \u201cDo you know why we were successful in the struggle for this land, and not Mr. Nair? Nair was well established in Bombay. We were completely new. He was wealthy. We had no money or regular income. He was influential\u2014he was the owner of the Free Press Journal, one of three English dailies in Bombay, and had been the sheriff of Bombay\u2014and knew many politicians and government officers. We hardly knew anyone. Yet we were successful and he was not. Why?\u201d Then Srila Prabhupada gave the answer: \u201cWe were acting to please Krsna, and he was acting for his personal gain. So, we are successful not by our own strength and resources but by Krsna\u2019s pleasure and mercy. So the devotees should come and sing and dance in front of the Deities and please Them, and by Their mercy\u2014Krsna\u2019s mercy\u2014we will get all success.\u201d\nAgain Srila Prabhupada was demonstrating his great faith in Krsna\u2014in the holy name and in the Deity\u2014and at the same time showing his protective mood toward his devotees. He didn\u2019t want them to become weak in their spiritual lives by overendeavoring for money. That is the duty of the acarya. He engages the devotees in service that will please the parampara, please the previous acaryas and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, but at the same he guides them in the proper practice of sadhana-bhakti, so that they remain strong in Krsna consciousness and are able to maintain their service and preach. As he wrote to one temple president, \u201cUnder all circumstances we must regularly chant sixteen rounds and attend the morning and evening classes. For Krsna we can work like anything, but one lick done for maya and it is useless, overendeavoring.\u201d Srila Prabhupada was very vigilant, very attentive. He didn\u2019t miss anything.\nTime passed, and we were successful, not only in getting the land, but also in obtaining the permits to build the temple, guesthouse, and cultural center. \nSrila Prabhupada had a staunch devotee named P. L. Sethi. To me, Sethiji was to Prabhupada as Hanuman was to Rama\u2014so staunch and faithful. In 1977, when Srila Prabhupada{\u2019s} was already quite ill, Mr. Sethi approached me. From before he met Prabhupada he was associated with a group called the Radha Madhava Prema Sudha Sankirtana Mandala. You know \u201cRadha Madhava\u201d and nama-sankirtana. Prema means \u201cpure love,\u201d suddha means \u201cnectar,\u201d and mandali means \u201cgroup,\u201d or \u201ccircle.\u201d Their guru was based in Vrndavana, and they chanted the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. In Bombay they were all householders. Every Sunday they would have a twelve-hour akhanda-hari-nama-sankirtana, unbroken, continuous kirtana, from six in the morning to six in the evening. \nMr. Sethi had the idea that instead of having the kirtana in one of their devotees\u2019 homes, as they usually did, they should have it at Hare Krishna Land. So we arranged it before the Deities in the small temple, beside the new complex that was nearing completion, beneath Srila Prabhupada\u2019s new quarters. Although the construction wasn\u2019t finished and the lift wasn\u2019t working, Srila Prabhupada had insisted on staying there. And ill as he was, while reclining or lying down, he was listening to the kirtana. \nThese devotees in the temple really wanted some personal reciprocation with Prabhupada, but they were too many to come up and he was unable to come down, and anyway it would have been too taxing for him to meet them all. At one stage they were so eager for his mercy that they came out of the temple and were doing kirtana beneath his balcony. Eventually Mr. Sethi helped him walk out onto the balcony. Prabhupada glanced down upon them, and they all felt a surge of ecstasy. \nThe next day, I went up to see Srila Prabhupada. \u201cThat kirtana was wonderful,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should invite the whole group to stay at Hare Krishna Land. Tell them that we will maintain them. They won\u2019t have to work. All they have to do is continuous kirtana.\u201d I thought, \u201cThese people are married. They have jobs, they have homes, they have children. How will it work if I propose that they just give up everything and stay with us?\u201d So I remained silent. Then he said, \u201cAt least all of our devotees should do twelve hours kirtana every day.\u201d I said, \u201cSrila Prabhupada, we have so much service to do. We have to finish the construction. We have to open the temple.\u201d I knew how important the Juhu project was to him. So I said, \u201cHow will we be able to do it all?\u201d Then Prabhupada said, \u201cAll right, then one day a week, on Sunday.\u201d By then I was so relieved, I immediately agreed: \u201cYes, we can do that.\u201d\nLater, Tamal Krishna Goswami commented that Srila Prabhupada had done transcendental bargaining with me. First Prabhupada said that I should invite fifty families to live on Hare Krishna Land and do twelve hours kirtana every day, and we would maintain them. Then he said that all of our devotees should do twelve hours kirtana every day. So by the time he proposed that we do twelve hours kirtana just one day a week, I was so relieved that I immediately agreed. If Prabhupada had begun, \u2018Twelve hours every Sunday,\u2019 I might have said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s too much. Maybe four hours.\u2019 But because he had begun by proposing that we maintain fifty families to chant twelve hours a day seven days a week, when he finally proposed that just we chant twelve hours one day a week, I was relieved. \u201cOh yes, we can do that.\u201d [laughter]\nThe twelve-hour kirtana on Sunday was practically the best thing we ever did at the Juhu temple. I was the temple president, and Juhu was a big project. There were always many problems. But somehow they all got solved by the Sunday kirtana. As Srila Prabhupada said, \u201cIf you just do sankirtana, all your problems will be solved.\u201d During the week, devotees would come with their problems, and on Monday, Tuesday, and maybe Wednesday I would try to deal with them. But by Thursday, I knew that the twelve-hour kirtana was coming and that all the problems would be solved. I didn\u2019t directly tell the devotees that I was waiting for the kirtana, because they might have thought I was being irresponsible. But I said, \u201cGive me some time to consider. I will speak to you again after the weekend.\u201d And it was miraculous. Either the devotee realized that the problem wasn\u2019t really a problem or the problem got solved on its own or Krsna gave me the inspiration how to deal with it, but after the twelve-hour kirtana, all the problems were solved. \nNow I shall move ahead to Srila Prabhupada\u2019s final pastime, not to discuss it in detail, but to draw out a principle. As you may know, before Srila Prabhupada left, he expressed a desire to go on a bullock cart to Govardhana Hill. Srila Prabhupada\u2019s condition was so delicate that many of the devotees thought he wouldn\u2019t survive the journey, that the jostling on the bullock cart would be too much for him. So Srila Prabhupada agreed not to go. That was just before govardhana-puja, and then, about three days later, Srila Prabhupada left. \nTamal Krishna Goswami and the other leaders arranged for us to take a small brass deity of Srila Prabhupada on parikrama to Govardhana Hill. We carried the deity and did half parikrama of Govardhana Hill, and at the end we came to Radha-kunda and Syama-kunda. The devotees placed the deity of Prabhupada at the sangam, between Radha-kunda and Syama-kunda, near the small shrine with govardhana-silas there. The devotees were doing kirtana, and I experienced that Srila Prabhupada\u2019s deity was not just a deity but was Prabhupada himself, that Srila Prabhupada was fully present as the deity. \nSrila Prabhupada is present as his deity, as his instructions, and even within the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Once, Satsvarupa asked Srila Prabhupada, \u201cNow, while you are here, we can ask you our questions directly, and you give us answers, but when you are not here, how will we get our answers?\u201d Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cThe holy name of Krsna is not different from Krsna. Do you understand this fact?\u201d \nHis Holiness Niranjana Swami said that we are all here because of Srila Prabhupada and that we thus owe a great debt of gratitude to His Divine Grace. Srila Prabhupada said that it is impossible for a disciple to repay his debt to the spiritual master but that the disciple should want to repay it and endeavor to repay it by preaching vigorously. As Srila Prabhupada wrote, \u201cIf you feel at all indebted to me, then you should preach vigorously like me. That is the proper way to repay me. Of course, no one can repay the debt to the spiritual master, but the spiritual master is very much pleased by such an attitude in the disciple.\u201d But again, to have the potency to preach, we have to practice. We have to chant our sixteen rounds, follow the regulative principles, and do everything that we\u2019ve been taught.\nNow I will take the opportunity to liquidate one debt\u2014I owe answers to two questions\u2014though in a way it is good to remain in debt. I heard that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura always kept his disciples in debt so that they would have to work hard. So I will liquidate just one of these debts. Nrsimha Prana Prabhu asked about the first Bombay pandal and something that happened there. \nThis spectacular program, \u201cBhagavata Dharma Discourses: A Hare Krishna Festival,\u201d was held in downtown Bombay from March 25 to April 4, 1971. I was the temple commander for the whole event, and I personally manned the book table. Now, behind the stage was a room made of cloth and bamboo poles, furnished with rented sofas and chairs, where Prabhupada would sit and meet people. And during the day, devotees would sit there and sometimes even take prasada. One afternoon, Srila Prabhupada arrived early, and the room was in a mess. The sofa and chairs were out of place, dirty cups and plates were left here and there, and the tables had not been dusted or washed. It was a mess. I sincerely apologized: \u201cSrila Prabhupada, I am sorry I did not get the room ready in time for you.\u201d Srila Prabhupada looked at me and said, \u201cHow much can you do? How much can one person do? It is better to control five asses than to work like an ass yourself.\u201d\nServing at the pandal all day, I noticed a young American spending time there. He had long matted hair and wore simple white cloth. He turned out to be a Saivite. And I thought, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t had the right association.\u201d So I spoke to him, quite directly, about Siva and Krsna and Sankaracarya. \nAt the book table, based on my experience in Boston, I knew that the best way to distribute a book was to put it in a person\u2019s hands and let him hold it, peruse it, and become attached to it. So I would do what I used to do in Boston. I would hand out magazines\u2014put them in the people\u2019s hands\u2014and after some time ask if they wanted to keep the magazine. If someone said yes, I would ask for a donation. But I soon discovered a difference between Bombay and Boston: in Bombay, many people would just walk away with the magazine or book. So I consulted one of our advisers, a life member, who said, \u201cOh, you can\u2019t do that in India.\u201d \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d \u201cYou have to cut a hole in the corner of each sample book and magazine, put a string through the hole, and tie the string to the leg of the table. That way they can hold the book, look at it, and see if they like it, but not walk away with it.\u201d\nThis young Saivite sadhu from America was spending time in the pandal, so I asked him if he would poke the holes in the corners of the magazines, and he did so, happily. And His Holiness Radhanath Swami says that I was the first devotee in ISKCON to engage him in devotional service [applause]. Srila Radhanath Swami ki jaya!\nLater, when I read Radhanath Swami\u2019s book The Journey Home and understood what his mentality was then, I realized that he wasn\u2019t the right person for the heavy type of preaching I gave him. But he is very kind and gives me the credit for being the first devotee to engage him in practical devotional service. \nSome time after the pandal program, we moved to Juhu, and there I got a very official letter typed on an Indian aerogram addressed to the temple president. The letter, using phrases from our publicity, said, \u201cI attended your pandal program and participated in the bhagavata-dharma discourses, the ecstatic kirtanas, and the sumptuous prasada. I feel very inspired, and convinced, and want to join this movement. So I am hereby submitting my official application to you as the temple president and request you to consider my request.\u201d Signed, \u201cRaghunath Patil.\u201d \nI immediately wrote back, saying, \u201cPlease come. You are most welcome. We will be happy to meet you, and after we meet, you can begin to stay with us.\u201d That Raghunath Bhagwan Patil eventually became His Holiness Lokanath Swami [applause]. Later, he told me he thought he had to apply for a place in ISKCON just like a person in India applies for a job. And he had to hire one of those typists on the sidewalks, especially around courthouses, to type his application. \nYou can see how Srila Prabhupada cast his loving net and caught these wonderful souls and brought them to the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Krsna. \nDevotee: Please tell us how to do our evening programs during the December marathon. During this period devotees distribute books and cannot take part in evening programs. Should they come back to the temple in order to do the evening program?\nGiriraj Swami: You have asked an excellent question. Srila Prabhupada was very pleased when the devotees engaged fully in the December marathon. So although in general it is nice to have an evening program, either in the temple or outside the temple, we can make an exception during the December marathon. But then again, on occasion it is also nice to have a period when we are free to just chant and hear, like when we have big festivals or retreats or go to India[,] to Mayapur or Vrndavana. So although in general we want to keep a balance on a daily basis, sometimes we can make an exception and forgo the evening program for the sake of book distribution. And sometimes, for a limited period, we can forgo book distribution and other services for the sake of becoming more immersed in hearing and chanting.\nThank you for listening so patiently. I look forward to having more of your association in the days to come. Now we will have more of those \u201cecstatic kirtanas.\u201d \nHare Krsna. \n","nid":"1268"},{
"title":"The Appearance of Lord Ramachandra - March 30, 2004, Kiev","ref":{"target_id":"15406"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Ramanavami"],"date":"Tue, 2010-03-23 18:13","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially edited transcript of a lecture given on March 30th, 2004, in Kiev, Ukraine, on the Appearance Day of Lord Ramacandra. Because the transcript was taken from an incomplete recording, there is no ending to the lecture. In order to compensate for the incompleteness of the topic discussed, a short, relevant section leading up to the appearance of Lord Ramacandra has been taken from Krishna Dharma dasa's rendering of the Ramayana. This summary of the Ramayana, published by Krishna Dharma dasa in 1999, was the primary source from which a major portion of this lecture was given.\n\nSince today is the Appearance Day of Lord Ramacandra, we will read one verse and purport in relationship to His appearance and activities in this world. This is Ninth Canto, Chapter 11, Text number 20.\nnedam yaso raghupateh sura-yacnayatta-\nlila-tanor adhika-samya-vimukta-dhamnah\nrakso-vadho jaladhi-bandhanam astra-pugaih\nkim tasya satru-hanane kapayah sahayah\nTRANSLATION\nLord Ramacandra's reputation for having killed Ravana with showers of arrows at the request of the demigods and for having built a bridge over the ocean does not constitute the factual glory of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra, whose spiritual body is always engaged in various pastimes. Lord Ramacandra has no equal or superior, and therefore He had no need to take help from the monkeys to gain victory over Ravana.\nPURPORT\nAs stated in the Vedas (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8):\nna tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate\nna tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate\nparasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate\nsvabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca \n[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]\n\"The Supreme Lord has nothing to do, and no one is found to be equal to or greater than Him, for everything is done naturally and systematically by His multifarious energies.\" The Lord has nothing to do (na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate); whatever He does is His pastime. The Lord has no duty to perform to oblige anyone. Nonetheless, He appears to act to protect His devotees or kill His enemies. Of course, no one can be the Lord's enemy, since who could be more powerful than the Lord? There is actually no question of anyone's being His enemy, but when the Lord wants to take pleasure in pastimes, He comes down to this material world and acts like a human being, thus showing His wonderful, glorious activities to please the devotees. His devotees always want to see the Lord victorious in varied activities, and therefore, to please Himself and them, the Lord sometimes agrees to act as a human being and perform wonderful, uncommon pastimes for the satisfaction of the devotees.\" \n[Niranjana Swami] This verse gives us a little insight into one of the reasons why the Lord appears. It's described that there are as many incarnations as there are waves in the ocean. Sometimes the Lord comes Himself, sometimes He sends an empowered jiva to act on His behalf, and sometimes He expands into different forms in order to fulfill different purposes in this world.\nWe understand from the following statement from Srimad Bhagavatam, that Lord Sri Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. \nete camsa-kalah pumsah\nkrsnas tu bhagavan svayam\nindrari-vyakulam lokam\nmrdayanti yuge yuge\nTRANSLATION\n\"All of the above-mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord, but Lord Sri Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead. All of them appear on planets whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists.\"\nIn Krsna Sandarbha, different types of incarnations of the Lord are described. One type is called svayam-rupa. Svayam-rupa is when the Supreme Lord appears in His original transcendental form, svayam bhagavan. In this connection, Srila Jiva Goswami quotes the verse from Brahma:\nisvarah paramah krsnah\nsac-cid-ananda-vigrahah\nanadir adir govindah\nsarva-karana-karanam\nTRANSLATION\nKrsna who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes. [B.S 5.1]\nAnd so once in a day of Brahma Lord Krsna appears in His original transcendental form. He explains in the Bhagavad-gita:\najo 'pi sann avyayatma\nbhutanam isvaro 'pi san\nprakrtim svam adhisthaya\nsambhavamy atma-mayaya\nTRANSLATION\nAlthough I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.\" [BG 4.6]\nThis form that Krsna speaks of in this verse is His svayam-rupa. And then there is tad-ekatma-rupa incarnation. Tad-ekatma-rupa is divided into two different categories. One is called tat-sama and the other is called tad-amsa. When He appears in His tat-sama incarnation, He is the Supreme Lord Himself, full, but He manifests a slightly different form.\nJiva Goswami gives different examples of the tat-sama incarnations. Lord Narayana in the Vaikuntha planets is a tat-sama form. Vasudeva Krsna is also tat-sama. When Krsna appears in this world, He appears as Vasudeva Krsna and also in His svayam-rupa form, the original Supreme Lord. Both forms appear simultaneously.\nIt is Vasudeva Krsna that leaves Vrndavana. Not svayam-rupa Krsna. Because svayam-rupa Krsna never leaves Vrndavana. So this form of Vasudeva Krsna is described as tat-sama. And the tad-amsa forms, they are expansions of the Supreme Lord who manifest some partial qualities of the Supreme Lord.\nIn this connection Srila Jiva Goswami says that different expansions of the Lord such as Sankarsana, is one such expansion. He manifests some partial aspect of the Supreme Lord.\nThere are also incarnations which are called avesa. Avesa are empowered living entities. There are different types of avesa incarnations. Some are empowered to display the characteristics of pure devotional service such as Narada Muni. Some are empowered to display the characteristics of transcendental knowledge such as the Four Kumaras. And some are empowered to display extraordinary prowess to perform a particular task. There are many different incarnations who are manifest in this form. One such incarnation was Prthu Maharaja.\nSrila Jiva Goswami also describes that in the tat-sama category of tad-ekatma rupa, is also Lord Ramacandra. He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead who appeared to display His pastimes in this world.\nThe primary purpose for the Lord's appearance is to display the loving affection between the Lord and His devotees. Another purpose for the appearance of Lord Ramacandra is to teach renunciation. How did He teach renunciation? Because He appeared as a human being who apparently underwent so many tribulations due to His affection for His wife. Ultimately He displayed His renunciation of all of that-- His renunciation of His kingdom, renunciation of the association of His wife, everything-- to teach by His example.\nThese points are all explained in the Srimad Bhagavatam in the Ninth Canto. Lord Ramacandra also appeared to display the characteristics of an ideal king. Rama-raja is the civilization led by an ideal king who is filled with all virtue.\nLord Ramacandra was loved by all the citizens because of all of His virtuous qualities. And because He loved all His citizens also, He cared for them and gave them full protection. Everyone felt complete protection. So this was another purpose for His appearance as Ramacandra.\nSo we can speak a little bit about the events which lead up to the appearance of Lord Ramacandra. It is also important to understand the points which Srila Prabhupada is bringing out here in this purport. When describing all of these events which may appear to be like the primary causes for the Lord's appearance we must always understand that ultimately the Lord appears by His own sweet will.\nThe Lord is not forced to appear. He chooses to appear. And there were circumstances which led Him to make that choice. Just as Prabhupada is explaining here that the Lord has nothing He has to do. He doesn't have to come to this world to kill demons. He could do it very easily from some far-off distant place. He really doesn't have to come to kill demons like Ravana. But He comes of His own choice. It's His pastime. Pastimes are voluntarily performed and this is how the Lord derives His pleasure.\nEven when Lord Ramacandra appears to be distressed, for instance sometimes He may cry out in anguish at the loss of Sita or He may appear distressed by seeing the distress of His father Dasarath, it only appears that way. These are not ordinary emotions of this material world.\nUltimately whenever the Supreme Lord appears, He appears by His own desire. He displays these pastimes to attract, inspire, and to protect His devotees. The Lord also leaves behind the continuous glorification of these pastimes for millenniums to come, which emanate from the mouths of His devotees who experience great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and conversing about Him.\nSo this earth was once ruled by a king whose name was Dasarath. This king Dasarath appeared in a very virtuous line of kings. During the reign of Dasarath everyone was happy. Everyone felt protected. King Dasarath loved his citizens. The citizens loved King Dasarath. He was a perfect example of an ideal king.\nDasarath had three queens. He had many queens, but he had three prominent queens. He had queens known as Kausalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. From all of these queens though, Dasarath had no issue, no son. Dasarath, who had been ruling the kingdom for many thousands of years, became very concerned and began to lament, \"What will happen when it becomes time for me to leave the kingdom and go to the forest if I do not have an appropriate son to take over and rule according to my will?\"\nSo one time he was thinking in this way, pacing back and forth in his palace. His wives, looking at him, could understand that there was something on his mind that was the cause of his distress. At that moment, one of his ministers came to Dasarath and told him that the great sage Vasistha had arrived in his palace.\nVasistha was the priest of Dasarath Maharaja. He was also the head priest and was like his spiritual master in all respects. He lived outside of Ayodhya but from time to time he would come at the request of the king. On this particular instance, King Dasarath's ministers came and told him, \"Vasistha has arrived,\" and as soon as Dasarath heard this, he immediately ran to meet Vasistha. He was very anxious to inquire from him, \"Can you please tell me how will I get a son?\"\nWhen he asked this question to Vasistha Rsi, Vasistha told him that he had recently been visited by one great sage. Vasistha Rsi was oftentimes visited by many wonderful, great, and powerful personalities who would come to his hermitage to sit and discuss hari-katha. \"I was recently visited by Sanat Kumar,\" he said, \"and he revealed to me that soon you will deliver four very powerful sons. So please do not be disturbed. By the arrangement of Providence your desire will be fulfilled.\"\nDasarath began thinking, \"Is there something I can do to bring this about?\" In consultation with others it was decided that he would perform a very big sacrifice. In previous ages, especially in the age of Treta yuga, many millions of years ago, such sacrifices were performed. Although an animal would be killed in such a sacrifice, the animal would achieve a much higher destination. In other words, the efficacy of the sacrifice would be proven by how the animal would give up it's body, if the soul within the animal's body would achieve either the heavenly planets or beyond.\nIn this age of Kali yuga such sacrifices are not to be performed. There are no qualified brahmanas in this age who can invoke the powerful mantras required for this such as the great sage Vasistha could invoke. Therefore brahmanas in this age cannot produce the desired result that was achieved in Treta yuga. For this reason in the age of Kali yuga such sacrifices are not only not performed but are condemned. But in Treta yuga it was customary to perform such a sacrifice.\nThe way it was done was that the king would select one horse. It would be a horse that would be completely free from all blemish. The king would set that horse free for one year.\nKing Dasarath sent four hundred warriors to travel everywhere that horse would roam to protect it and to see that nothing would happen to it. Wherever the horse would go, into whatever kingdom, the king who reigned in that kingdom would have to accept the horse's presence as an invitation to attend the sacrifice of Maharaja Dasarath. Maharaja Dasarath was the emperor of the whole world and all other kings were meant to be subordinate to him. If the king would not accept the invitation, then Maharaja Dasarath would have to take his warriors and go and defeat that king and his soldiers in battle. Until they were defeated, the sacrifice could not be performed.\nSo this horse traveled around continuously for one year from kingdom to kingdom. Everywhere it went, the subordinate kings immediately accepted it as an invitation to attend the horse sacrifice. After one year the horse returned. The sacrifice could now be performed and all the kings agreed to come and would participate as invited guests.\nVasistha Rsi told all Maharaja Dasarath's ministers to prepare for the arrival of all of these kings who would be coming from throughout the whole world. They constructed many beautiful, marble palaces simply to receive all of the kings. He also instructed, \"Whatever these kings and other visitors who will come wish, you must immediately give it to them. You should never give anything begrudgingly.\" He said, \"If they are not fully satisfied then the person who is giving the gifts will not get the desired result of his sacrifice.\nAt the appropriate time all of these kings came to Ayodhya. They were also carrying very valuable costly jewels as gifts to offer to Maharaja Dasarath. Maharaja Dasarath arranged many different dramatic performances simply to entertain all of his guests. They lived in beautiful palaces and every desire that was in their heart was fully satisfied.\nThen Maharaja Dasarath checked with astrologers to select the appropriate time for the sacrifice to begin. When the designated time arrived, all of the kings assembled with all of their queens. Many of their ministers came also, and Dasarath Maharaja also appeared at the sacrificial arena along with his wives, Kaikeyi, Kausalya and Sumitra.\nThey all sat and observed. The sacrifice was to be performed by Vasistha Rsi. Another great sage, Rishwashringa, was also invited to take part. He was a very powerful sage. They prepared many, many sacrificial fires that began blazing everywhere. Then at the appropriate time the horse was brought in by it's reigns. Vasistha Rsi chanted mantras and the horse immediately fell unconscious.\nImmediately the horse was placed on the sacrificial fire. Everybody sitting there was watching. Those with spiritual vision, could see an effulgent form coming from the body of the horse, ascending into the sky and into the heavens. They could understand that everything was performed perfectly. The living entity in this horse's body achieved an elevated status as a result of the sacrifice.\nWhen Dasarath Maharaja saw this, he became so pleased. He wanted to give in charity to the thousands of brahmanas who had attended. He announced, \"Today I give in charity this entire earth to all of you. Everything I have in my kingdom, everything on this planet, all of my wealth, is yours. I will just keep just a few simple possessions. Everything else belongs to you. Please take it.\"\nWhen the brahmanas heard Dasarath speaking in this way, they folded their hands and said, \"We are simple brahmanas. We don't need the whole earth. You are the king. You are the emperor of the whole world. Please, you should keep and just give us just a little something.\" They did not want to accept the whole earth. They were brahmanas. Actually this is also explained in the pastime of Vamandeva, when He appeared as a brahmana.\nWhen Bali Maharaja wanted to give so much wealth to Vamanadeva, Vamanadeva said, \"No. I am a brahmana. I should not take too much. I'm meant to live very simply and if I take too much my brahma-tejas will be affected by living comfortably. Please just give me three steps of land.\" But that's another pastime which we won't get into just now.\nHere we see though, that the principle is the same. Brahmanas do want to accept more than they need. So Dasarath Maharaja gave away millions of cows in charity to all of the brahmanas. He gave enough wealth to these thousands of brahmanas so that they could live comfortably for the rest of their lives.\nOf course, that's what it was like in Treta yuga. In Kali yuga we don't see such generosity existing. Neither do we see such wealth. In Treta yuga there was so much unlimited wealth, so much unlimited opulence, because the Lord was so pleased by the performances of sacrifices. Therefore there was no lack for anybody in the kingdom.\nSo after distributing all of this charity, then Vasistha and Rishwashringa had to perform one more ritual. They had to perform one more sacrifice in the fire which would invoke the presence of the demigods. By chanting mantras, they invited every demigod to appear in this sacrifice.\nSome of sages present looked up in the sky and could see that all the demigods had assembled. Lord Brahma was there. Lord Siva was there. Indra was there. Vayu was there. All the demigods appeared and were assembled there in the sky. Many of the demigods approached Brahma, because whenever there are disturbances created in the universe, the demigods go to Brahma, just as Bhumi went to Brahma prior to the advent of Lord Krsna. She was feeling overburdened by the weight of demoniac kings and she approached Lord Brahma and appealed to him, \"Please what can we do to rectify the situation?\"\nSo these demigods approached Lord Brahma during the time of this sacrifice. Most of the assembled guests could not see. But some of the very highly elevated sages could see all of this taking place. And what were the demigods doing? They were appealing to Brahma, \"Please. A sacrifice is being performed here right now by the most virtuous king Dasarath Maharaja. The purpose of this sacrifice is that he wants a son. But present in this universe is one Rakshasa, a demon who received a boon from you, that he could not be destroyed by any gods from anywhere within this creation. He is very powerful and is a man-eating Rakshasa.\" \n\"Ravana sends his Rakshasa followers to the hermitages where sages perform sacrifices and they disturb their sacrifices. They throw pus, flesh, stool and urine on their sacrifices, they kill brahmanas and eat their flesh. We can't stop him. He's always challenging our position as well. He not only disturbs the sacrifices performed on the earth, but he travels in the heavens as well. He is causing so many disturbances in the heavenly planets. And you gave him the benediction that he could not be killed by any gods.\"\n\"Ravana never asked for the benediction to not be killed by a human because he considered humans to be insignificant. Therefore Dasarath Maharaja is now praying intensely for the appearance of a son. You should pray for the Supreme Lord Himself to appear as a mortal being in this world. By the intensity of your devotion and deep meditation certainly you can invoke the Lord to appear as the son of Maharaja Dasarath.\"\nWhen Brahma heard all of the demigods speaking in this way, he understood that he had to do something to rectify this situation.\nNow before we continue, we have to explain about Ravana's history. We explained that Ravana would not only create disturbances on the earthly planets to the brahmanas, but he would also create chaos in the upper planetary systems as well. \nIn fact one time, Ravana defeated the treasurer of the demigods, Kuvera. The result of having defeated Kuvera is that he was given Kuvera's chariot which could travel anywhere in the universe. This chariot had palaces, lakes, gardens, rivers. It was such a huge chariot that it had all heavenly delights right on the chariot.\nHow do you think it was driven? Simply by the mind. The driver only had to think of a place and the chariot would immediately carry him to that destination. When Ravana defeated Kuvera, he took possession of this chariot and he began traveling everywhere looking for objects to prey upon. And what was Ravana's fondest objects to prey upon? Ravana was most interested in enjoying beautiful women. \nSo while Ravana was driving around the universe one time he happened to look down on the earthly planet and saw one very beautiful ascetic woman sitting in meditation. She was wearing a deerskin, fully absorbed in meditation.\nRavana was very much attracted by her form. Immediately his mind told the chariot where to go and immediately the chariot descended to that place. He got down from his chariot. Ravana had the ability to assume any form that he wished. So this time he assumed the form of a very handsome king. He approached this woman and began speaking to her. \"Oh my beautiful woman. What are you doing here? Who do you belong to? Why are you sitting in this lonely place? Don't you know it is dangerous to sit in a lonely place without any protection?\"\nThe woman came from out from her meditation. She told the king, \"My name is Vedavati. My father is the son of Brhaspati and I'm the incarnation of the Vedas. I've been sitting here in meditation for thousands of years. My father has tried to make many arrangements for my marriage, but I will not accept anyone for marriage accept Lord Visnu. So you are wasting your time. Please allow me to continue my austerities and meditation and depart at once.\"\nRavana indignantly replied, \"Don't you know who I am? I am Ravana. I am the most powerful king. Nobody can defeat me. And when I want something for the object of my pleasure, nobody can stop me.\" He grabbed the hair of that ascetic woman but by her mystic powers, she immediately created a shield about her. By chanting a mantra, her hair that he was holding onto immediately separated from her body and Ravana fell down back on the ground.\nVedavati said to him, \"You fool. I curse you. Just as you are trying to violate me by your brute powers and strength, I curse you that you and your followers will be destroyed in the future as the result of the wrath of a woman. I will appear again from the earth and I will be the cause of your destruction.\"\nImmediately Vedavati went back into meditation, she created a fire, and her whole body was consumed by that fire. She completely disappeared.\nAll Ravana could now see was a pile of ashes. He thought nothing of the curse. \"Everybody makes curses\" he thought. \"But who can affect me? Nobody can destroy me.\" So he got back into his chariot and continued traveling about the universe looking for another opportunity to strike. His chariot came to a place called Kailasa where Lord Siva resides. But all of a sudden the chariot just stopped. He tried to make it go farther but it wouldn't go anywhere.\nNow Ravana does not like obstructions. So he immediately got down from the chariot to figure out what was happening. \"Why was this chariot obstructed?\", he thought to himself. As he walked a short distance he saw one strange-looking person. When Ravana looked at him closely he said to him, \"Your face looks like a monkey. Who are you?\" This person replied, \"My name is Nandi. I am a servant of Lord Siva. You cannot go any farther into this area. Take your chariot, turn it around, and go in the other direction. This kingdom is controlled by Lord Siva. Don't you know who Lord Siva is?\"\nRavana, in his usual pride, began mocking Nandi for his physical appearance. He said, \"I'm not going to be stopped by some monkey-faced person.\" Nandi became very disturbed by this insult. He replied, \"Just as you are making fun of my appearance right now, I curse you that soon will appear a whole dynasty of monkeys and they will destroy all of your followers.\"\nRavana didn't think anything of that curse. But at the moment the curse was made, the demigods began pounding kettledrums in the sky and flowers were falling on the spot. Ravana was saying, \"Humph. A curse. Useless curses. Where is this Siva anyways?\" He thought, \"Well maybe this Siva is on this mountain and this mountain is obstructing the path of my chariot. So I will destroy this mountain.\"\nRavana, who had ten heads and many powerful arms, placed his arms underneath that mountain, and just lifted that whole mountain and began to shake it as if he was going to pull it away and destroy it. Lord Siva and Parvati were sitting on Mount Kailasa and Parvati became afraid. She said, \"Oh my Lord, what is happening?\" She was so scared. She never experienced the trembling of the whole Mount Kailasa before.\nLord Siva tried to pacify Parvati. He said, \"Do not worry. It is only some sinful Rakshasa named Ravana. He is powerless. He cannot do anything.\" Just at that moment, Lord Siva took his toe, placed it on Mount Kailasa and pressed down. As soon as he pressed down on the mountain, Ravana, who had all of his arms under that mountain loudly groaned and became trapped. There was nothing he could do. With all of his strength, he couldn't move the mountain. He became very distressed. Soon he understood that this was done by none other than Lord Siva.\nRavana knew that Lord Siva was very powerful, in fact, undefeatable. Although he tried so hard to get out, there was nothing he could do. Ravana's ministers told him, \"If you offer some prayers to Siva maybe he will be pleased and you can get out of this situation.\" So Ravana decided, \"I think I better do something here.\" So he began offering prayers in order to satisfy Lord Siva. After one hundred years Lord Siva appeared and released him.\nRavana was then able to remove his arms. But because he satisfied Lord Siva by his worship, Lord Siva said that he was ready to bestow upon him a benediction. Another name of Lord Siva is Asutosha. Asutosha means one who is easily pleased. He's very inclined to bestow a benediction upon someone even if the benediction will be the cause of their own ruination. So Ravana asked him, \"Please, I want your weapon. Give me your weapon Pashupata.\" Just at that moment Ravana felt a mantra enter into his mind and he understood that the weapon Pashupata had entered into his mind as well. He could invoke it now at any time he wished.\nBut still Parvati was very disturbed by this. She felt it was not right that this Ravana had scared her in this way. So she cursed Ravana also. \"Just as you made a woman afraid by your terrible acts, in the future a woman will be the cause of your destruction.\" As usual, Ravana did not think much of the curse. So he got back into his chariot, which waited for him for a hundred years and began thinking who he could conquer next.\nIn his travels he came upon the city of Ayodhya. At that time in Ayodhya was a very powerful king whose name was Anaranya. If fact, Anaranya was the emperor of the whole world at a time previous to Dasarath Maharaja. Ravana decided that he would attack the kingdom of Ayodhya. Anaranya understanding that his kingdom was about to be attacked, called upon all of his warriors to go out and fight against Ravana and all of his Raksasha followers. But Ravana was too powerful for them. He destroyed Anaranya's whole army. His army fought very valiantly, but ultimately the only warrior left to fight was Anaranya Himself. Ravana said to Anaranya. \"You fool. You impudent fool. Who do you think you are that you can defeat me. I am Ravana. And just as all of your army has been killed today, so you will be sent to the kingdom of death.\"\nAnaranya was a very virtuous king. He replied, \"You cannot send me to the kingdom of death. Death is due to come to everyone by the will of Providence and if death meets me today it is not by your acts at all. It comes by the will of the Supreme.\"\nAnaranya also had mystic powers as a result of austerities performed previously. He decided that before he was killed, he would curse Ravana. Although he had been struck fiercely by Ravana, there was still life left in his body. He said to Ravana, \"With whatever power is left in my body, I curse you.\" Aranya continued, \"Just as you have destroyed everyone in Ayodhya, in the future line of this kingdom, a king will come who will destroy you and all of your followers.\" Anaranya then left his body. Kettledrums could be heard and flowers began to fall from the sky. The gods were becoming very pleased.\nAfter receiving this curse, Ravana got back into his chariot and continued his travels. This time Ravana entered into the heavenly regions. This time a very beautiful heavenly nymph caught his eyes. As soon as he saw the form of this woman, he was immediately captivated by lust. This was Ravana's nature. He was very captivated whenever he would see the form of a beautiful woman. He would immediately capture her and would take her to Lanka.\nIn Lanka Ravana kept a whole harem of beautiful women. He would take pleasure in violating them and he would engage in so many other sinful activities. He was thinking, \"Here's another candidate for my harem.\" So he stopped his chariot and got out and again he assumed a very handsome form. This heavenly society girl's name was Rambha. She was the wife of Nalakuvera, who was the son of Kuvera.\nRavana approached her and expressed his desire to enjoy with her. But Rambha said, \"No it is not possible. You cannot enjoy with me. My husband's father is your brother. It's impossible for you to approach me in this way.\" Ravana responded, \"These things are insignificant to me. Do not think that your arguments are going to stop me from the fulfillment of my desires.\"\nSome of the demigods nearby immediately ran to Nalakuvara and explained what was about to happen. Nalakuvara was powerless, he said, \"This Ravana. He has received such benedictions. We cannot do anything to stop him.\"\nRavana took this Rambha and he grabbed her and violated her in so many different ways. When the news spread to Nalakuvara what happened to his wife, he said, \"There is nothing I can do to stop this sinful wretch. But still I will curse him.\" So he invoked a curse. He said to Ravana, \"Ravana, just as you have forced a woman and violated her the way that you have just done, I curse you that if you ever violate a woman against her will again your body will immediately die. It will fall to the ground lifeless.\"\nRavana was accumulating quite a significant number of curses. But still he was thinking they were insignificant. \"They will not stop me. Nobody can stop me,\" he thought.\nNow Ravana was getting a little bored because everywhere he was going he was not finding a suitable match. So when he got back to his chariot, at that moment, appeared Narada Muni. Now we know Narada Muni is very expert. He knows how to hasten the situation to invoke the Lord's presence. Ravana liked Narada, because Narada would sometimes sit down with Ravana and would give him good advice.\nSo when Narada appeared before Ravana, Ravana just kind of gave him a friendly salute and welcomed him. Narada then sat down, though Narada would never really touch the ground. He would always stay a little bit above the ground whenever he would speak or meet with somebody. Narada began explaining to Ravana, \"Ravana, why are you wasting so much time on these mortal beings and gods. Aren't you convinced by now that there is no match here for your power? They are all going to die one way or another anyway. Why are you wasting your energy? You need a good match. Why don't you go to Yamaraja? I think he's a good match for you. He'll satisfy you. He's somebody who is of equal strength and will give you a good fight.\"\nNow Narada knew that Yamaraja could not be defeated. So he was thinking that he would try to accelerate things and try to get him to stop creating all of these disturbances in the mortal world and in the heavenly planets. So Narada sent Ravana to Yamaloka where the Lord of death resided. Ravana thought, \"This sounds like a good idea. Narada Muni has always given me some good ideas in the past. I'll take his advice.\"\nImmediately Ravana got into his chariot and began to think of Yamaloka. The Pushpaka chariot immediately took him to that place where Yamaraja and all his Yamadutas were busily engaged in their various activities. When Ravana approached Yamaloka, he saw that the Yamadutas were carrying all of these subtle bodies and they were inflicting so much pain and punishment upon them. He decided that he was going to fight with them, having not seen Yamaraja yet. \"Where is this Lord of death?\", he thought. \"But I think I know how to get him here.\"\nThe Yamadutas are very powerful also and they put up a big fight. They began defending themselves. They killed many of Ravana's Rakshasas. Ravana then remembered the weapon he got from Lord Siva and he invoked that Pasupati weapon, which is like the fire which destroys the entire universe at the time of devastation. He began ravaging and killing all of the Yamadutas. Word got back to Yamaraja what was happening to all of the Yamadutas. Yamaraja immediately decided he would get into his chariot to see what this Ravana was doing to his servants.\nAccompanying Yamaraja on one side, was Death personified. And on the other side was time. Just as Krsna says, kalo 'smi, \"I am time and I've come to destroy everything in this world in this form.\" So Death personified and time were accompanying Yamaraja in his chariot to see what this Ravana was doing to all of the Yamadutas. When Yamaraja saw Ravana destroying all of his servants, Yamaraja became angry as fire. His eyes became red-hot. He began firing weapons at Ravana and was inflicting great pain upon him.\nRavana got up though and he took his weapons and began firing back at Yamaraja and also inflicted pain upon him. Yamaraja became more and more angry. He picked up his invincible mace that could destroy anything. Just at that moment, Death personified spoke to Yamaraja. He said, \"O Yamaraja, please do not expend any more of your energy on this insignificant insect. Please I am your servant. Nobody can defeat me. I am Death personified and everyone must fall victim to my invincible weapons. Please let me finish him off now. You go back. Don't worry. I will take care of him.\"\nYamaraja was thinking, \"No I want the pleasure of destroying him myself.\" So he took his mace and was just about to throw it. At that moment Lord Brahma appeared. Brahma said to Yamaraja, \"Stop. Do not do this. I have given him a benediction that he cannot be killed by any gods. This benediction cannot be reversed. If you kill him now, then it will have an adverse effect because of my benediction and everyone else will be killed. So you cannot do this at this time. Please, let him live. In due course of time, he will meet his destruction.\"\nYamaraja heeded Lord Brahma's instruction and then he immediately left that place. Ravana was thinking, \"Huh. Just see. Even Yamaraja is scared of me. He left the battlefield. He has been defeated by me. Now there is nobody who can defeat me.\"\nBrahma had given this benediction previously to Ravana. Ravana by dint of his austerities had satisfied Lord Brahma. Lord Brahma gave him the benediction that he would not be able to be killed by any gods. However, as we said before, because Ravana was thinking that ordinary mortals and animals were an insignificant match for him, he did not even ask for the benediction to be protected from them.\nSo now we'll go back to the horse sacrifice. All the demigods are in the sky. Rishwashringa and Vasistha had performed the sacrifice to invite all of the demigods. The demigods were appealing to Lord Brahma, \"Look what you have done. We beg you, please reverse what you have done by taking full advantage of this sacrifice being performed. Maharaja Dasarath is performing this sacrifice in order to get a son. Please perform meditation and request the Lord to appear as the son of Dasarath. Request Him to appear as an ordinary mortal king, even though he is the Supreme Lord Himself.\"\nAfter hearing this request, Brahma performed meditation. Soon thereafter, off in the distance appeared Garuda. On his back was standing Lord Visnu in His four-armed form. Lord Visnu began speaking to him, \"O Brahma, because of your meditation, your penances, and your devotion, I have agreed to come before you now. I will also agree to your request and soon I will take birth as the son of Maharaja Dasarath. I will bring with me, three very powerful weapons, my brothers who are My expansions. All four of Us will appear in the dynasty of Maharaja Dasarath.\"\nThe Lord then left that place. While the brahmanas were performing the sacrifice, not everyone could see what was taking place in the sky. Only some of the very elevated sages could see. The sacrificial performance continued and the flames were rising very high. Out of the flames came an effulgent personality carrying a golden pot. This effulgent personality descended before Maharaja Dasarath. Maharaja Dasarath immediately could understand that he was a representative of Visnu. Dasarath Maharaja prostrated himself before the Lord's representative.\nThis effulgent personality then said to Maharaja Dasarath: [the recording suddenly ends here]\n\nThe following paragraphs is the exact text from the Ramayana, written by Krishna Dharma dasa:\n\n\"By worshipping the gods in sacrifice you have received this reward, \" said the messenger. \"Take now this ambrosia prepared by the gods which will bestow upon you the offspring you desire. Give it to your wives and through them you will soon secure four celebrated sons.\"\nAccepting the ambrosia with his head bent low and saying, \"So be it,\" the king felt a surge of joy as he took the golden vessel, even as a pauper would feel happiness upon suddenly gaining great wealth.\nAs a mark of respect, the king walked with folded hands around the messenger, who, having discharged his duty, immediately vanished into the fire from which he had appeared. The king stood in amazement holding the bowl. All around him the brahmins cried out, \"Victory! Victory!\" After offering his prostrate obeisances to Vasishtha, Dasarath left the sacrifice along with his wives and returned to his palace.\nThe king gave half of the ambrosia to Kaushalya. He gave the other half to Kaikeyi, the youngest wife, who was especially dear to him. Both of these wives each gave a part of their share to the king's third wife, Sumitra. All those noble wives of the emperor felt honored and immediately ate the ambrosia. In a short time they felt within themselves the presence of powerful offspring. Their minds were enlivened by the divine energy of the children inside their wombs, and they felt elated. Dasarath, who had at last attained his desired object, felt as delighted as Indra, the king of the gods in heaven.\nHaving decided to incarnate in Dasarath's family, Vishnu summoned the gods and commanded them, \"Soon my advent upon earth will occur. Assisted by all of you, I will crush the despicable Ravana. Foolishly, that evil one did not ask immunity from humans or animals, considering both to be entirely powerless in the face of his strength. As promised, I will descend as a human. O gods, without leaving your posts as universal controllers, you are capable of expanding yourselves onto earth. You should therefore appear in the world as powerful monkeys.\"\nVishnu's plan for the protection of the worlds was unfolding. The gods took birth as monkeys who had strength equal to their godly power. They could assume various forms at will, they were gallant, as swift as the wind, highly intelligent and practically invulnerable in battle.\nThe earth became populated with millions of huge monkeys who, in the way of the gods, grew up as soon as they were born. As haughty and strong as lions and tigers, they roared loudly and sprang about fearlessly. They were headed by Vali, the expansion of Indra, and by Sugriva, the expansion of Surya. Fearful in appearance, they thronged the peaks of mountains and resided in great forests. When they came together they appeared like masses of clouds moving about on the surface of the globe.\nDasarath, his desire fulfilled, dwelt happily in Ayodhya awaiting the birth of his sons. The brahmins and kings who had assembled for the sacrifice left for their various abodes, sent on their way with kind words and gifts by the emperor. Four seasons passed. Then, at a time when favorable stars were visible in the heavens, Kaushalya gave birth to a son named Rama.\nThough Rama was the Lord of creation, Kaushalya saw him simply as her own dear child. She held him tight to her bosom, overwhelmed with motherly affection and unable to recognize his divinity. Coming out of the delivery room, Kaushalya shone brilliantly with that baby boy, who had eyes like lotus petals.\nNext, a son named Bharat was born from Kaikeyi; and from Sumitra, who had received two portions of ambrosia, were born twin sons, Lakshmana and Shatrughna. All three boys resembled celestials and they seemed to blaze with their splendor. \n","nid":"1252"},{

I mentioned to him that I was coming to Ukraine and asked if he had any information that would be useful for me. He said, \u201cThe devotees there are very nice, and once you have visited, you will want to come back again.\u201d So far I\u2019ve seen that the devotees here are very nice, and I hope to reciprocate your kindness in an appropriate way. \nOne of the first things I heard when I entered Ukraine was from Damodara Carana Prabhu. He said, \u201cThe devotees are waiting to hear your memories.\u201d And in the car today Nrsimha Prana Prabhu asked me about a specific incident that took place in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s presence. So I must at least answer his question. But to give a proper context to these experiences with Srila Prabhupada, I will begin from the beginning, which was in Boston in 1969.\nI was already looking for a guru. I was actually looking for perfect happiness, and I was reading books about Eastern philosophy and mysticism. From reading these books, I got the idea that I needed a guru. So my search became how to find my guru. There were many gurus, or so-called gurus, in America then, and I began to meet them. But in every case I found some defect and concluded, \u201cThis is not my perfect master.\u201d I met so many, and I was beginning to feel hopeless. Finally I decided, \u201cI will go to India to find my guru.\u201d\nA month before completing my last year at the university, I saw posters in different places on the campus with a picture of a holy man from India. The poster read, \u201cLecture on the Bhagavad-gita As It Is by Swami A. C. Bhaktivedanta.\u201d Now, that night I had arranged to go with some friends to see an art film at Harvard Square. I was already a vegetarian, so I invited the friends to my apartment for pasta and salad, and then we were supposed to go to the movie. But I kept thinking of that poster, and something in my heart kept pushing me, telling me, \u201cYou must go to the lecture.\u201d \nI told my friends that I wanted to go, but they were very upset. One in particular was most distraught and complained, \u201cWhy do you always have to be running after these svamis and yogis? Why can\u2019t you be like other people?\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to upset her or the other friends. I actually wanted to agree to skip the lecture and go with them to the movie, but something in my heart kept forcing me, \u201cYou must go.\u201d Finally I said, \u201cI will go tonight, but I promise you this will be the last svami I ever go to.\u201d [laughter]\nSo we went to the auditorium, but because of the argument with my friends we reached late. There kirtana was being performed on the stage. Srila Prabhupada was sitting on the stage, one of the devotees was leading the singing, and the other devotees were dancing in a circle. One by one the students in the auditorium were getting out of their seats and jumping up on the stage and dancing with the devotees. The transcendental sound vibration in the auditorium was so powerful that I also felt like running up on the stage and joining the chanting and dancing, but I looked at my friends on my side and thought, \u201cIf I do that, it will be too much for them to bear.\u201d So I stood up and was singing and dancing in my place. I didn\u2019t go on the stage.\nAfter the kirtana, one of the devotees announced that they needed a ride to Boston because they didn\u2019t have a car. In those days they didn\u2019t have a motor vehicle. So he said, \u201cIf anyone is driving to Harvard Square or Boston, the devotees need a lift.\u201d Earlier, I had told my friends, \u201cLet us go to the lecture, and then afterward we\u2019ll go to the late show of the film,\u201d which was at Harvard Square. So I met the devotees in the foyer of the auditorium and told them, \u201cI have a station wagon and am driving to Harvard Square. I can take some devotees with me.\u201d Many devotees--all the devotees--squeezed into that station wagon. I don\u2019t know how they fit, but there were front and back seats and a compartment in the rear. So three of us sat in front--I was driving--and maybe four or five squeezed in the back, and everyone else squeezed in the rear compartment. \nI got the address of the temple. They explained that on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays there were programs in the temple, and that on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays there were programs outside, usually at a university. So I could come to the temple the next day.\nI went, and the small temple room was packed, full of people. Srila Prabhupada was speaking. His Indian accent was quite strong at the time, and I wasn\u2019t used to the accent or the philosophy, so it was a little hard for me to understand what he was saying. At one stage he quoted a verse from the Bhagavad-gita: manusyanam sahasresu kascid yatati siddhaye, and translated, \u201cOut of many thousands of persons, one will seek perfection.\u201d And I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s me! [laughter] He is talking about me!\u201d \nI began to come every night, every alternate night to the temple and every alternate night outside. And because the devotees didn\u2019t have a car, they asked if I could drive them. They said I should come early, to Srila Prabhupada\u2019s apartment, which they had rented for him across from the temple, and then drive him and the other devotees. \nWhen I arrived, Srila Prabhupada was sitting behind a low table, and the devotees were sitting on the floor around him. I was struck by how much love there was between Srila Prabhupada and the devotees. It was like a spiritual family: Srila Prabhupada was the transcendental father and the devotees were his spiritual children. \nIn fact, after one of the first lectures of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s I attended, someone asked him, \u201cHave you actually experienced that being Krsna conscious, you are the happiest person?\u201d Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cYes. When I was in India I had five children and there were always so many problems, and now that I have taken to Krsna consciousness I have five hundred children and there are no problems, and I love them and they love me.\u201d The questioner said, \u201cYes, but that\u2019s material.\u201d And Prabhupada replied, \u201cI have many other platforms of happiness, but I have answered on a platform that you can understand. When I was living in India I had five children, and now that I have come to Krsna consciousness I have five hundred children. So one who surrenders to Krsna is not the loser but is the gainer by many times.\u201d \nSo, I saw this beautiful atmosphere and mood between Srila Prabhupada and the devotees, and after some minutes Srila Prabhupada told the devotees to get ready for the program. \nOne of the first programs was at the Harvard University divinity school, and the students there were very smart. Or they thought they were smart. After Srila Prabhupada\u2019s lecture some of them asked challenging questions. One student proposed, \u201cA lot of people suffer in this world, and they suffer for pretty definable reasons: economic exploitation, racists trying to put strictures, militaristic powers. And it seems we might be able to do something to attack those kinds of evils other than telling a man to chant Hare Krsna and the world\u2019s problems will be solved.\u201d Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cIf you chant, if you come to this God consciousness, those things will automatically be solved--just like if you get a million dollars, your fifty dollars\u2019 business will automatically be solved.\u201d The student replied, \u201cYeah, I guess that you could believe that.\u201d And Prabhupada said, \u201cNot believe--it is practical.\u201d The student pressed on: \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t believe that is because history has told me differently. History has told me that people who have managed to achieve freedom for themselves have not achieved it by doing something like chanting Hare Krsna.\u201d \u201cCan you show in the history there was chanting of Hare Krsna?\u201d Prabhupada asked. The student answered, \u201cI won\u2019t say chanting only Hare Krsna, but in Russia, in the nineteenth century, there were people who were religious who traveled the countryside chanting the name \u2018Jesus Christ.\u2019 It was quite prominent then. And I would assume that a similar kind of teaching was given. The only problem I see with that is that I don\u2019t think it would solve the very basic human problems.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think,\u201d Prabhupada asked, \u201cthat Russia has solved their questions, that their problems, all problems, have been solved?\u201d \u201cI would say,\u201d the student replied, \u201cthat in 1917 the state of the Russian peasants was fundamentally improved by the revolution.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Prabhupada countered, \u201cthe history will repeat itself. Again there will be wars.\u201d And then Prabhupada asked the most fundamental question: Do you think that by adopting the Russian method, people have become very happy?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d admitted the student.\u201d \u201cThen?\u201d And Prabhupada explained, \u201cThis material world is problematic, like a blazing fire. So, the answer is given in the Bhagavad-gita, daivi hy esa gunamayi mama duratyaya [Bg 7.14]. The onslaught of the material nature is very, very severe. Nobody can surpass it. In some way or other, it will come. And the problem will not be solved. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te. The problem can be solved only when one surrenders unto God, Krsna. Then he can surpass this onslaught of material nature. So that is the real remedy. Unfortunately, people do not take that process. But if anyone accepts this process, his problems are solved. That is the fact. But we do not expect that everyone can accept this process. But if someone can accept this process, at least his personal problems will be solved. It is the duty of such God conscious persons to distribute the message. And if anyone likes, he can take; he can solve his problems. And if he does not take, that is his business. What can I do? But any material method--this Russian method or American method or Indian method--any materialistic method cannot solve the material problems. If you want to solve all the problems, then you have to invoke your dormant love for God. That is the solution. There is no other solution.\u201d\nThe next student asked, \u201cI was wondering how important the choice of words is to the chanting. If you just count to ten in your mind or out loud, it might work just as well.\u201d And Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cYou can try counting, and when you stop counting you can try chanting.\u201d [laughter] \nOne by one the students asked challenging questions, and without a moment\u2019s hesitation Srila Prabhupada answered and defeated them.\nAfter the talk, the students were buzzing. They were talking to each other about the svami. They were really impressed. They didn\u2019t expect the svami to be so intelligent and quick. And I was just wandering among them, listening to what they were saying. Then suddenly one of the devotees came rushing up to me and, lovingly imitating Srila Prabhupada\u2019s accent, said, \u201cSo, where is the driver?\u201d [laughter] Then I realized, \u201cOh my God, Srila Prabhupada is waiting for me.\u201d\nSo we all packed into the car. Srila Prabhupada was in the front seat with me, and the devotees squeezed in the back seat and rear compartment. By then it had become dark, and I wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to find my way back to the temple. But I had a general idea of which way to go, so I went straight, then right, then left, but as I kept going further, I realized that I was lost. I finally had to admit it: \u201cWe are lost. Does anyone know the way?\u201d Srila Prabhupada turned to me and said, \u201cIs not the driver supposed to know the way?\u201d [laughter] I didn\u2019t realize I was the driver [laughter] or that the person who drove had special duties or responsibilities. I was just doing what the devotees had asked me to do. Anyway, the other devotees also didn\u2019t know the way, but eventually we found our way back to the temple.\nI ran around the car to open the door for Srila Prabhupada, and when he got out I said, \u201cPrabhupada, I am sorry that we got lost.\u201d Srila Prabhupada looked at me with great love and compassion and, smiling, said, \u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d I was very impressed. Not only did he have the perfect philosophy and process, but on a personal level he was very compassionate and forgiving.\nIn this way, I joined the Boston temple, and I was there for one and a half years. Then Srila Prabhupada decided to return to India and begin his mission there, and he wanted the number-two person from each temple to go. In Boston I had become the second person. Satsvarupa Maharaja was the temple president, and I had become the temple commander, treasurer, and sankirtana leader. Hrdayananda dasa Brahmacari was the assistant sankirtana leader, so I spent a few days with him teaching him how to be the leader, and then the time came to go.\nThe arrangement was that we would fly to Brussels and there we would meet the devotees from London, who had arranged a very cheap flight from Brussels to Bombay. They had made friends with a businessman who owned an airline, called Bosco, that consisted of only one aircraft meant for carrying cargo. That friend had an apartment in Brussels, so for a few hours after arriving from America, we went to the apartment. And there we met these wonderful devotees, these two couples from England, Syamasundara and Malati, and Gurudasa and Yamuna. The atmosphere was thick with devotion to Srila Prabhupada; we could feel it as soon as we walked inside. \nWe flew to Bombay. At the Bombay airport an Indian gentleman approached us and said that he had come to receive us and take us to his home. So, we drove quite a distance from the Santa Cruz airport to downtown Bombay, and on the way I was looking out the window at all the sights, all the local people. For the first time, I saw rickshaws, and cows in the streets. I was fascinated. The man took us to his home on Marine Drive, and about a week later Srila Prabhupada came from Calcutta. \nIt was there at Seksaria Bhavan that Srila Prabhupada spoke to me personally for the first time. I would always dance in the kirtanas, and when he called for me I imagined that he might have noticed that I was making an effort to always dance and that thus he had called for me. He asked some questions about Boston. At the time, there had been some difficulty with Brahmananda Prabhu, and Srila Prabhupada commented, \u201cHow could that have happened? He was so advanced.\u201d Prabhupada was wondering how such confusion could befall such an advanced devotee.\nAfter spending some time in Bombay, Srila Prabhupada received an invitation to attend the Vedanta Sammelan in Amritsar, Punjab. The Vedanta Ashram was a Mayavadi ashram. Soon, we discovered that there was a circuit, a series of such gatherings of sadhus, and that sadhus would go from one to another--and these sadhus were all basically Mayavadis. \nThe program\u2019s big attraction was Srila Prabhupada and his disciples. Srila Prabhupada said of the organizers, \u201cThey know that I don\u2019t agree with them, but they invited me because so many people are attracted to seeing me and my disciples. People are not interested in dry, impersonal speculation.\u201d \nThe crowd was really interested in the kirtana, and they were restless during the talks. They couldn\u2019t sit still and listen to philosophy for too long, but they really wanted kirtana. And Prabhupada wanted to train us to speak. \u201cIn the evenings,\u201d he said, \u201cyou all do the kirtana and speak.\u201d So we went, but one night Gurudasa Prabhu--he was the senior man and was giving all the talks--one night he said something that offended the audience. Because most of the people were Mayavadis, Gurudasa challenged them, \u201cIf it is all one, then why don\u2019t you give me your wife?\u201d Now, philosophically he had made a good point, but the Indian sentiments were a little offended. So the organizers complained to Srila Prabhupada, who in turn said to me, \u201cAll right, from tomorrow you speak.\u201d \nThe morning after my first talk Srila Prabhupada was taking his massage in the sun, and I happened to walk nearby. So, Prabhupada addressed me, \u201cI heard you speaking last night, and it was very nice.\u201d I didn\u2019t know that Srila Prabhupada could hear me from his room. \nSrila Prabhupada was very eager to preach. He really wanted to establish the movement in India. And he began to accept invitations to outside programs during the day. He accepted so many engagements that we devotees--young men and women--could not keep up with him. He was doing four or five programs daily, and finally Gurudasa Prabhu approached him. \u201cSrila Prabhupada, the devotees can\u2019t keep up with this pace.\u201d Then Prabhupada agreed, \u201cAll right. I will only accept two engagements per day.\u201d But then, as we were nearing the end of our stay, there were many, many invitations that Prabhupada wanted to accept. One day Prabhupada accepted invitations to seven programs. The organizers arranged a car for Srila Prabhupada, but the devotees had to go by rickshaw, bicycle rickshaw, and the programs were happening so fast, one after the other, that we fell behind. We would reach the one program just when Prabhupada was leaving [laughter]. \nBut at the last program, from the way Srila Prabhupada was speaking, we could understand that the audience was very Krsna conscious. They were naturally already devotees of Krsna. And it was very mystical, because Srila Prabhupada was speaking in Hindi and I didn\u2019t really know Hindi, but there was so much love in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s words that somehow I was able to understand what he was saying. He did quote a lot of verses that I knew.\nAfter the last program, Srila Prabhupada and his close disciples went ahead in the car and we followed by rickshaw, back to the ashram. It was quite late at night, and Prabhupada had had seven engagements, but still the light was on in his room. I probably shouldn\u2019t have done it, but I wanted to peek in the window and see what Srila Prabhupada was doing. He was reclining and listening to the recording of the talk he had just given. I thought, \u201cPrabhupada is relishing. He is associating with Krsna. He is relishing hearing the talk he gave, because in listening to his talk he is associating with Krsna.\u201d\nFrom Amritsar Srila Prabhupada and the disciples took a train to Delhi. Actually, they were taking the train to Bombay, but the train stopped in Delhi. It turned out that Prabhupada had been corresponding with a lawyer from Delhi and had sent him a letter saying that he would be at the Delhi train station for two hours from such-and-such time to such-and-such time on such-and-such date and that \u201cIf you want you can meet me there.\u201d So the man, D. L. Gupta, came. He really wanted Prabhupada to leave some disciples in Delhi to preach there. He said he would give them two rooms in sort of an ashram. So Prabhupada said to Gurudasa, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get down and see what you can do.\u201d Gurudasa wanted some devotees to help him, and in the end Prabhupada agreed on Gurudasa and his wife Yamuna, Gopala, Bruce (who later became Bhanu dasa and then Bhanu Swami), and me as the party for Delhi. \nWhile we were in Delhi, Srila Prabhupada sent a letter to Gurudasa asking him to go to Vrndavana to see if he could get some land for ISKCON there. So Gurudasa went. He was supposed to go for just a day or two, but he didn\u2019t come back. Yamuna was in charge of the party in his absence, and she thought, \u201cWe better go and see what\u2019s happening.\u201d So we gathered our belongings and went to Vrndavana. In Vrndavana we met Gurudasa, and he said, \u201cVrndavana is a very special place. It is completely different. When I arrived here I told the local people that I have come with a specific mission, to see the palace of the king of Bharatpur at Kesi-ghata. I told them, \u2018I just want to see the palace and see if I can meet the Maharaja, and then I have to go back to Delhi.\u2019 But these Vrajavasis just looked at me and smiled and said, \u2018Vrndavana has its own ways. You cannot just come and spend a night and go. You have to take your time, and when Vrndavana wants to let you go, you will go.\u2019\u201d\nGurudasa took us to a place where he was camping. One night I was in the mood to wander around Vrndavana. It was cool, being November, and there was some moonlight, but all the narrow lanes and buildings looked the same to me, and I couldn\u2019t find my way back. Finally I gave up. I saw a big building, a temple compound, and noticed that on the steps leading to the temple, on a verandah along the front of the temple, some old men were lying down and sleeping. So I thought, \u201cI will also just lie down and spend the night here.\u201d So I slept under the moon and stars, and somehow the next day I was able to meet up with the devotees. \nIn Vrndavana I felt that I could really sense Krsna\u2019s presence. I felt that Krsna and the cowherd boys and cows were there and that Krsna was tending the cows with His cowherd friends. I felt that that was happening then and there. Later, when I met Srila Prabhupada in Bombay and he asked me about Vrndavana, I told him that I could feel the presence of Krsna there, and he commented, \u201cYes, you cannot see Krsna yet, but you can feel His presence.\u201d\nFrom Bombay Srila Prabhupada received an invitation to go to Indore for the Gita Jayanti celebrations. Our party was still based in Delhi, so we met him there. The Gita Jayanti Mahotsava was somewhat similar to the Vedanta Samelan in Amritsar. Many of the same Mayavadis attended, and the daily program was similar. There was a pandal and a stage, and thousands of people would come. So, the organizers wanted Prabhupada and his disciples to be on stage for the whole program, but after the first night, Srila Prabhupada refused. He said, \u201cWhy should I sit and listen to some Mayavadi speak nonsense?\u201d But the organizers really wanted Prabhupada and the devotees there, because it was Srila Prabhupada and the devotees that the people really wanted to see. But Prabhupada said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nThe devotees would do kirtana, and Prabhupada would speak at the beginning of the program. The pandal would fill up and then, when Prabhupada and the devotees left the stage, most of the people in the pandal would walk out. So the organizers thought, \u201cWe will keep Prabhupada and the devotees at the end.\u201d Then people didn\u2019t come at the beginning of the program; they came only at the end. \nOne evening something extraordinary took place on stage. Srila Prabhupada and the devotees were dancing, but someone in the audience wanted the devotees to come down and dance with them in the pandal. This man started to pull the bottom of the ladies\u2019 saris to get them to come into the crowd. And Prabhupada immediately rushed forward, swinging his karatalas. He was like Lord Nrsimhadeva with His Sudarsana cakra. He came rushing forward with his karatalas as if he were going to smash that person. Prabhupada was very protective of his devotees. He took very good care of all his devotees, and in India he was especially protective of his lady devotees. \nIn Amritsar the organizers of the Vedanta Sammelan wanted to give some presentation to the devotees, and Srila Prabhupada knew that we were cold. The ashram provided only two rooms. Srila Prabhupada was in one, and in the other, next door, were the ladies: Yamuna, Malati, and Kausalya. The rest of us would sleep outdoors on Indian cots made with ropes. So, when the organizers wanted to offer something, Srila Prabhupada asked them to give each devotee a wool sweater and a woolen blanket. And one morning, when we came in Srila Prabhupada\u2019s room, he personally gave us with his own hand--each one of us--a wool sweater and a woolen blanket. Although he demanded a high degree of surrender, he also took care to see that our basic necessities were arranged. \nFrom Gorakhpur we went to Surat, and there Srila Prabhupada and the devotees received the best reception. The whole city seemed to be Vaisnava. Every morning, Srila Prabhupada would send the devotees to perform hari-nama-sankirtana in the streets, and the newspapers would announce the devotees\u2019 route. And people would line the streets. Many people would close their businesses, and as the procession would come down the streets, people would put garlands on the devotees, offer arati, and give them refreshments--cool drinks and sweets. \nMany of the events in Surat were filmed by Yadubara Prabhu, who has assembled all the footage in a DVD series called Following Srila Prabhupada. I really encourage everyone to see these DVDs. There are scenes of Srila Prabhupada in the old Boston temple and scenes of him and the devotees in Bombay, Amritsar, Surat, and other places in India--how they were received by the public there. \nI think it is time to end now, but before we do, are there any questions or comments?\nNiranjana Swami: You said that in 1970 when you left Boston you had to train Hrdayananda dasa Brahmacari to take over your position of sankirtana leader. Can you briefly describe what sankirtana in Boston, the 1970s, was like?\nGiriraj Swami: Every day, we would go out in a van, usually to the Boston Common, a large park in downtown Boston. We would rise by four and be in the temple at four-thirty for mangala-arati, and we would stay in the temple for the whole morning program. Then at eight-thirty the devotees would clean the temple building. Everyone had an assigned area to clean. Then there would be a simple breakfast, which was highly regimented: two slices of orange, one slice of apple, three raisins, two chickpeas, a slice of ginger, a ladleful of breakfast cereal. \nThen, as the sankirtana leader, I would have to put all the books that we wanted into crates and boxes, and all the musical instruments and crates and boxes into the van. And then I had to get all the devotees together to go in the van. \nAt the Boston Common most of the devotees would be in the kirtana party. Some would have Back to Godheads in arm and approach the crowd who would gather around the kirtana party. Then at about noon a vehicle would come from the temple with a large pot of dal, a large pot of rice, stacks of chapattis, and a pot with a sabji (cooked vegetable preparation). The devotees would take turns having prasada on the grass, but the kirtana and book distribution would always continue. Then maybe at five-thirty or six in the evening we\u2019d come back to the temple. \nSometimes we wanted to go out in the evening as well. There were not many people at the Boston Common in the evening, so we would go to Boyleston Street and chant on the street and approach people with Back to Godheads. Practically the whole temple would go out during the day; fewer would go out in the evening. But the attraction of sankirtana was so great, we would not want to stop. So Satsvarupa set a deadline, that we must leave for the temple by 9:00. Even then, when the sankirtana was really good I would go into a local establishment and ask to use the phone, to call Satsvarupa and ask if we could stay out later. And if I insisted, he would always agree\u2014\u201cbut not past 9:30.\u201d \nIn the evening at the temple I would collect the laksmi from all the devotees. I was also the treasurer, so I would both count it and bank it. And we would retire for the night eagerly anticipating the next day\u2019s activities. \nThank you all very much. We will be happy to see you tomorrow.\nSrila Prabhupada ki jaya! \n","nid":"1243"},{

He has descended because He is an ocean of transcendental mercy. Let me surrender unto His lotus feet.\nPURPORT\nThis verse and the following verse are included in the Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka (6.74\u201375), by Sri Kavi-karnapura.\nkalan nastam bhakti-yogam nijam yah\npraduskartum krsna-caitanya-nama\navirbhutas tasya padaravinde\ngadham gadham liyatam citta-bhrngah (CC Madhya 6.255)\nTRANSLATION\n\"Let my consciousness, which is like a honeybee, take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has just now appeared as Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu to teach the ancient system of devotional service to Himself. This system had almost been lost due to the influence of time.\"\nPURPORT\nAs Lord Krsna states in the Bhagavad-gita (4.7):\nyada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata\nabhyutthanam adharmasya tadatmanam srjamy aham\n\"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion -- at that time I descend Myself.\"\nThis is also the case with Caitanya Mahaprabhu's appearance. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared in this world as a disguised incarnation of Krsna, but His appearance is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Mahabharata and other Vedic scriptures. He appeared in order to teach the fallen souls in this material world, for in this Age of Kali almost everyone has become attached to fruitive and ritualistic activities and mental speculation. Consequently there was a great need to revive the system of devotional service. The Lord Himself personally came down disguised as a devotee so that the fallen populace might take advantage of the Lord's example.\nAt the conclusion of the Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krsna advised complete surrender unto Him, promising all protection to His devotee. Unfortunately, people are so fallen that they cannot accept the instructions of Lord Krsna; therefore Krsna returned with the same mission, but He executed it in a different way. As Lord Sri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He ordered us to surrender unto Himself, but as Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, He taught us how to surrender to Krsna. Therefore He is praised by the Gosvamis: namo maha-vadanyaya krsna-prema-pradaye te. Lord Sri Krsna is certainly the Personality of Godhead, but He is not as magnanimous as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Lord Krsna simply gave orders for one to become His devotee (man-mana bhava mad-bhaktah), but Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu actually taught the process of Krsna consciousness. If one wants to become a devotee of Krsna, he must first take shelter of the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, following in the footsteps of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya and other exalted devotees. [End of Purport]\n[Niranjana Swami]: I was thinking of a verse to read from today and this verse from Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya came to my mind. It is a very well-known verse. Srila Prabhupada also used to quote this verse quite often. In this verse Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya is glorifying Lord Caitanya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And in the verse on the board, he is stating the same thing in a different way. He is also glorifying Lord Caitanya \"as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has 'just now' appeared.\"\nIt is interesting to take note of the circumstances under which Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya composed these verses. As we know Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was defeated by Lord Caitanya. Previously he was accustomed to dry logic and argument. He was very much attached to the study of scripture, though, as we also know, he wasn't able to recognize Lord Caitanya as the Supreme Lord. Therefore Lord Caitanya devised a plan how to rectify Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya by first sitting and listening to Vedanta from him for seven continuous days, even though Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya presented the knowledge of Vedanta in an impersonal way.\nAfter many continuous days, Sarvabhauma became a little frustrated that Lord Caitanya had given no response to anything he had to say. Finally he asked the Lord to say something just to confirm that He had understood a little about what he was speaking. Lord Caitanya explained, \"I can understand the scriptures that you are speaking from but unfortunately you have clouded the essence of these scriptures with your interpretation, and that I cannot hear.\nTherefore Lord Caitanya simply tolerated Sarvabhauma's recitation for seven continuous days\u2014even Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya's interpretation of Vedanta. Then, later Lord Caitanya defeated Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya by His explanation of Vedanta. He also explained to him the meaning of the \"atmarama\" verse of the Srimad-Bhagavatam. Although previously Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was accustomed to logic and argument, by Lord Caitanya's mercy, he realized that logic and argument wasn't going to give him what he needed to fully realize the absolute truth.\nHe also realized that he needed to accept everything he heard from Caitanya Mahaprabhu and therefore he fully submitted himself to the Lord. Lord Caitanya then revealed to Sarvabhauma a very wonderful form. First He manifested a four-armed form. Then He showed His two-armed form. Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya prostrated himself before the Lord and completely surrendered to Him.\nSome time shortly after this revelation, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya composed one hundred verses in glorification of Lord Caitanya known as Sarvabhauma-sataka. He was very expert in composing verses and could do it spontaneously in perfect grammar. After composing Sarvabhauma-sataka, he also composed two other verses, the ones which we've just read today. At this time Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was already recognized as a great devotee. Gopinath Acarya, his brother-in-law, was also very happy to see that Sarvabhauma had become a great Vaisnava.\nSarvabhauma Bhattacarya composed these two verses on two palm leaves. He gave these verses to Jagadananda and Damodara Pandita along with a large quantity of maha-prasadam he had collected from Lord Jagannath's offerings. \nJust prior to that, Lord Caitanya had brought some maha-prasadam to Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya one morning when Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya had just awoken from sleep. Although one should not eat before first taking bath, washing mouth, and fully cleansing himself, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya took the maha-prasadam from the hand of the Lord and immediately put it in his mouth\u2014something he would have never done before. But because he had become such a great devotee he immediately understood the great value of maha-prasadam as being non-different from the Lord and therefore he spontaneously honored it.\nLord Caitanya was very surprised, \"Sarvabhauma, this is not like you.\" And then Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya began quoting verses from the sastra describing how that as soon as one sees maha-prasadam there is no circumstances, no criteria, whatsoever, one should immediately take it and honor it.\nDevotees like this verse (devotees laugh). We've seen many devotees take advantage of this verse in the morning after mangala arati; going for the sandesa, for the burfi and the sweet rice. Unfortunately we had one devotee in Boston who was so enthusiastic to take advantage of this verse that he was going into the refrigerator before the sweets were even offered to the Deities. The pujaris would go to make up the plates in the morning and many sweets would be missing. He would say, \"As soon as one sees maha-prasadam he should immediately take it.\" He was a bhakta. He didn't know better. Devotees had to explain that maha-prasadam means that which is offered to the Lord, not that which is offered to the tongue. So he reformed and waited until after mangala arati.\nBut Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya immediately took this maha-prasadam because he knew the great value of maha-prasadam. So he sent Jagannath's maha-prasadam along with these two verses which he composed. He asked Damodara Pandita and Jagadananda to deliver these to Lord Caitanya. So just before entering into the house where Lord Caitanya was staying, Mukunda saw these palm leaves. After he read what was on each palm leaf, he knew what Lord Caitanya would do. So he wrote these two verses on the side of the house\u2014 on the wall.\nHe then sent the two verses into Lord Caitanya along with the maha-prasadam. When Lord Caitanya saw these two verses on the palm leaf, immediately He took the leaves and ripped them up. Now why did He do that? We know why He did it. The same reason why Mukunda knew why the Lord was going to do it, and that's why Mukunda took wrote them on the wall first, so that all the Vaisnavas would not lose them. They took these two verses and embraced them in their hearts upon reading them.\nSarvabhauma Bhattacarya was very bold. In both verses he said let me take shelter of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It took some fearlessness to compose these verses to offer to the Lord because externally Lord Caitanya would become displeased. He didn't want to hear that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That was not His mood. Lord Caitanya appeared as channa-avatara, in the mood of a devotee of the Lord.\nHere in this purport Prabhupada cites that there is confirmation of this point in the Srimad-Bhagavatam. One such reference is Prahlada Maharaja, who in his prayers to Lord Nrsimhadeva says:\n[\u2026]\"My Lord, You appear in various incarnations as a human being, an animal, a great saint, a demigod, a fish or a tortoise, thus maintaining the entire creation in different planetary systems and killing the demoniac principles. According to the age, O my Lord, You protect the principles of religion. In the age of Kali, however, You do not assert Yourself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore You are known as Triyuga, or the Lord who appears in three yugas.\" (SB 7.9.38)\nIn Satya, Treta, and Dvapara yugas, the Lord appears as the Supreme Lord. But in Kali-yuga, the Lord is hidden, He is channa-avatara. He is a hidden avatara. He doesn't assert Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whereas previously in Dvapara-yuga He asserted Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nsarva-dharman parityajya\nmam ekam saranam vraja\naham tvam sarva-papebhyo\nmoksayisyami ma sucah (Bg 18.66 ) \nKrsna said, \"Abandon all varieties of religion, surrender unto Me and I will deliver you from all sinful reactions.\" Prabhupada explains in his commentary to one song that previously when the Lord appeared as Krsna, He established a condition, \"First you surrender to Me.\" But as Caitanya Mahaprabhu, He took that condition away. Instead of surrender, He said, simply just take that which I have come to offer. He didn't display Himself as the Supreme Lord but always as a devotee of the Lord.\nIt's also explained that when the Lord appeared as Lord Krsna, He taught this principle of surrender in a theoretical way. He said,\nman-mana bhava mad-bhakto\nmad-yaji mam namaskuru\nmam evaisyasi satyam te\npratijane priyo 'si me (Bg 18.65)\nPrabhupada quotes that verse here also in this purport, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru, \"Always think of Me, worship Me, offer obeisances to Me, and surely you will come to Me.\" So Krsna explained to Arjuna that \"You should meditate on Me, you should think of Me, you should worship Me.\" And in the next verse He says, \"Surrender unto Me.\"\nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur says that when Krsna says surrender in that verse of Bhagavad-gita, sarva dharmam parityajya, all the components of surrender are in the previous verse. What were those components of surrender? Think of Krsna. Worship Krsna. Always offer prayers to Krsna. These were the components of surrender that Krsna was talking about when Krsna says, \"Surrender to Me.\" But Krsna taught that in a theoretical way and therefore He had to come again and to teach by His example because example is more powerful.\nTherefore when He appeared as Caitanya Mahaprabhu, He appeared to show this surrender to Krsna, by His example. Who was the devotee who was always thinking of Krsna the most? Always speaking about Him? She was none one other than Srimati Radharani. She is always absorbed in thoughts of Krsna. So Lord Caitanya appeared and He adopted the mood of Radharani, the topmost devotee who is always thinking of Krsna and is always serving Krsna.\nLord Caitanya didn't like it when devotees would refer to Him as the Supreme Lord. He would block His ears. Or sometimes He would simply go away.\nOne time, in Santipura, Advaita Acarya had this idea. He said to all the assembled devotees, \"Let us have a kirtan and simply chant the names of Gauranga.\" When all the devotees heard this, they became afraid because they knew that Lord Caitanya wouldn't like it. But Advaita Acarya, was the foremost of all Vaisnavas. It was Advaita Acarya who called the Lord to descend. Therefore, it is known that one of the purposes for the Lord's descent was to answer the prayers of Advaita Acarya.\nAdvaita Acarya had made many statements about forcing the Lord to appear. He knew that only the Lord could deliver the residents of Kali-yuga. So Advaita Acarya showed that He had power to control the Lord by His prayers. He worshiped a sila with Ganges water and Tulasi and called out to the Lord.\nPreviously, all the Vaisnavas who appeared before Lord Caitanya, although they would gather at the house of Advaita Acarya, they would have kirtan, they would hear Vedanta from Advaita Acarya, who would always present it in terms of devotional service, they couldn't do anything to change the mentality of the materialistic people.\nIn fact Advaita Acarya told all these assembled devotees how concerned He was by the state of affairs in Kali Yuga. He saw the mentality of the people, how they were so much absorbed in materialism. And although He is the Supreme Lord Mahavisnu, still He couldn't convince them to give up their materialistic ways.\nSo Advaita Acarya told all the devotees who were feeling such great lamentation to see all these living entities who were going to suffer and go to hell, said, 'I will bring the Lord personally. Only He can deliver them. And if He doesn't come then I will personally sever their heads from their body.\"\nSuch a strong statement. Somebody hears this and asks, \"How is this mercy?\" Advaita Acarya is saying, \"If I can't get Lord Caitanya to come, I will have to sever everybody's head from their bodies.\" But He knew His power to bring the Lord. And therefore He made such a statement because He knew the Lord would hear His prayers.\nSo Advaita Acarya had the power to invoke Lord Caitanya to appear. That was one of the reasons for Lord Caitanya's appearance. \nAccording to Caitanya Caritamrta, there were external reasons and internal reasons for the Lord's appearance, about which I believe Tattvavit Prabhu has been speaking about in the days leading up to Gaura Purnima. We will therefore not speak so much about these internal and external reasons for the Lord's appearance. But the two external reasons for the Lord's appearance were to answer the call of Advaita Acarya and to disseminate the congregational chanting of the Holy Names of the Lord. \nSo at this one particular time, Advaita Acarya told all the devotees, \"Let us chant the name of Gauranga.\" One of the prayers He was chanting was jaya jaya sri krsna caitanya vanamali, jaya jaya nija-bhakti-rasa-kutuvali, which means \"Glory glory to Sri Krsna Caitanya who is nondifferent from the forest-flower garlanded Krsna in Vrndavana. He has come to taste krsna-bhakti-rasa, devotional service to Himself.\"\nThis is one of the prayers that Advaita Acarya was chanting with the devotees. So when all the devotees saw that Advaita Acarya was fearless, He was chanting the names of Gauranga, they all got caught up in His mood and started chanting the names of Gauranga also. They were chanting so many different names of Lord Caitanya, describing Him as nondifferent from Lord Sri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nLord Caitanya, from a distance, heard the kirtan. He didn't hear what they were chanting, but He heard a very loud kirtan. So He decided to come closer, because wherever there is kirtan, that's where Lord Caitanya wants to be. So the devotees saw Lord Caitanya approaching and they all looked to Advaita Acarya, \"What do we do now?\"\nAdvaita Acarya started chanting louder and was dancing and dancing. The devotees could see how fearless He was. So the devotees, by His example\u2026. Here again we see the same principle. It's another example about the importance of having an example. By that example, they became fearless and they did the same thing. The devotees wouldn't have done, except they saw Advaita Acarya doing it and therefore they became fearless. They said, \"If Advaita Acarya is doing it, let's do it.\" They became fearless by His example.\nSo Advaita Acarya started dancing and chanting louder. Lord Caitanya came closer and asked, \"What is this? What is this you are chanting.\" They didn't answer. They just looked at Him. All the devotees gathered around Lord Caitanya, chanting the names of Gauranga! Gauranga! Gauranga! They would have never done this if it wasn't for Advaita Acarya's transcendental provocation.\nLord Caitanya just became embarrassed. He left and went back to His house. He closed the door and the devotees just followed Him with the kirtan. Lord Caitanya went into His room and lied down as if to go to sleep. He then He said to Govinda, \"All right, let the Vaisnavas in,\" and then He just went to sleep.\nAll the Vaisnavas came in. They came into Lord Caitanya's room and Lord Caitanya awakened. Srivasa Pandita was in front, and Lord Caitanya asked, \"Srivasa, tell me what is this? What is this that you are singing about?\"\nSrivasa took his hand and he put it up like this, and that was the answer. Lord Caitanya asked, \"What does this mean? What do you mean by that gesture?\" Srivasa replied, \"What I mean is that I've taken my hand as if trying block the sun. But how can I block the sun with my hand? Similarly how is possible that You could hide yourself as the Supreme Lord. We know who You are. Even if I could block the sun with my hand, which I can't, but even if I could block the sun with my hand, You could never hide who You are from amongst the devotees.\"\nHe continued, \"Even if You lie in the milk ocean, You could not hide Yourself. How do You think You could come into this world full of human beings and hide Yourself amongst us?\" Everyone will recognize who You are. The whole universe will be chanting Your glories. From the lowest planet to the highest planet, everyone will be chanting Your glories. All living entities in creation will be chanting Your glories. How will you be able to punish all of them? Tell me. You will not be able to punish them. We know who you are and therefore we are chanting these names. Although You do not reveal Yourself to everyone, still, by Your mercy, everyone can see who You are.\"\nThis appears to be a contradiction. The Supreme Lord doesn't reveal Himself to just anyone. In fact He even said that to brahmana who was worshipping Gopal. He said, \"I do not reveal Myself to everybody. Persons who are not My servant cannot see My form.\" That's another story. We'll tell that one too, because it's another example why Lord Caitanya didn't want to disclose His identity.\nBut here Srivasa Pandita is saying, \"On one hand, You don't reveal Yourself to everybody. But by Your mercy, You reveal Yourself to everybody. Therefore You are very merciful.\"\nWhen Krsna appeared not everybody recognized who He was. He appeared as the Supreme Lord. Prabhupada said, \"Only a handful could recognize that He was Krsna.\" But when the Lord appeared as a devotee of the Lord, He was hidden and was not asserting Himself as the Supreme Lord. But His mercy was so great, that everyone could understand who He was, even though He was playing the role of a devotee.\nHe would cry. He would serve the devotees. He would glorify the devotees. He would take the clothes of His devotees to wash them for them. He would bow down and take the dust from the lotus feet of the devotees. He was always behaving like\u2026 well not always behaving like a devotee.\nWe know there was a time in His youth when He wasn't behaving like a devotee. All the devotees used to pray to the Lord, \"If only Nimai would become a devotee, I would completely surrender myself to Him. If only He would become a devotee.\"\nIn the Lord's youth, the Lord behaved as an arrogant young pandita who was very much accustomed to logic and argument. He was much inclined towards defeating others on the basis of scripture. He was always looking for someone to engage in debate with. Then He would defeat them and they would admit defeat, and after they would admit defeat, He would defeat His same argument that He used to defeat them.\nAfter defeating His own arguments, they would be astounded, \"How is it possible that you defeated such conclusive truths?\" And Lord Caitanya would ask them, \"So you will accept?\" They would reply, \"I have to accept.\" Then immediately He would take that argument, defeat it, and establish a new conclusion.\nPeople would see Him getting into so many arguments. He was defeating others because He was trying to attract a lot of followers. All the devotees who had descended before Lord Caitanya to assist Him in His pastimes, and who had all assembled in Navadvipa, they would lament.\nWhen they would see such a display of arrogance, they would say, \"If only He would become a devotee. With His knowledge of scripture and His ability to defeat others, He could make everybody a Vaisnava.\"\nSometimes Nimai would even meet the devotees on the street and the devotees would run away. They were afraid, \"If I get caught with Him, I know He is just going to get into an argument with me. We are going to just start discussing different topics and He is going to try to defeat me.\" So they would run away to avoid Him. Imagine, they were running away. Instead they would just simply pray, \"If only Nimai would become a devotee.\"\nSo Lord Caitanya didn't always display the mood of a devotee, in His youth and in His childhood too. In His childhood, He displayed many different mischievous pastimes similar to Krsna's mischievous pastimes in Gokula. Nimai would go down to the Ganges and He would steal the garments of people who were taking their bath. When people wanted to leave their place to service their bodies, Lord Caitanya would sometimes go, lock the door, and lock them in so that they couldn't get out.\nWhile the men and women were taking bath in the river, the men on one side and the women on the other side, Lord Caitanya would come and switch the clothes. He would put all of the men's clothes on the women's side and all of the women's clothes on the men's side. They would come out of the water after taking their bath, and the men would find saris. The women would find dhotis and kurtas.\nSometimes when the men were in the water and were chanting gayatri, Lord Caitanya would jump in and while He was under them in the water, He would pull their legs out from underneath them. Sometimes, when they would come out of the water, Lord Caitanya would walk up to them and He would spit on them.\nThey said, \"I just took a bath so that I could do my puja, and this mischievous child is coming and spitting on me and contaminating me. I have to go back into the water and take my bath. I'm so contaminated by His spitting.\"\nFinally all of them got together one day and they decided they would go to Jagannath Misra to complain about Nimai to him.\nThey said, \"Do you know what your son does? Sometimes I'm sitting on the banks of the Ganga and I'm about ready to do my puja, He takes all the paraphernalia off the altar and He sits down on the altar Himself? And your son says to me, 'Don't you know that all this paraphernalia is meant to be offered to Me?' What kind of a son are you raising?\" There were so many complaints they were telling Jagannath Misra about all the different things Nimai was doing at the river.\nThey would tell him about all the activities in the water, how he and His friends would throw mud in the water, dirt, spit, and get contaminated. And one after another all these brahmanas would complain to Jagannath Misra and Jagannath Misra would listen intently to everything.\nThen all of the girls would come and complain to Sacimata. \"Do you know what your son does? He comes up to us and says, 'Marry Me.' How could He say something like that? Can't you control your son. Sometimes He throws seeds in our hair and our hair gets all stuck together with these seeds.\" So they would complain. Nimai was just like mischievous child Krsna performing mischievous childhood pastimes in Gokula. Instead it was Lord Caitanya performing these mischievous childhood pastimes in Navadvipa.\nJust as in Gokula, all the gopis would come and they would complain to Mother Yasoda and then they would say, \"Actually we are not angry with your son. How can we become angry with your son? We just came to tell you about some of the things that He was doing. But we cannot become angry.\" Although we know as Krsna, He was stealing the yogurt and the butter. He would also disturb the little children when He would go into the homes of the cowherd women and would sometimes put water in the ears of the children. He would untie the calves and all the calves would go and drink all the milk from the cows before they would milk the cows.\nIn the morning all the women used to decorate the walls of the house with nice white-colored lime and Krsna would take mud and He would throw it all over the walls. So the gopis would come and complain to Nanda Maharaja and Mother Yasoda also about Krsna's behavior. They would say, \"When we try to catch your son, we would say, 'Stop, you thief!' And your son would say to us, 'You're calling me a thief? You're the thief. All this butter belongs to Me.\"\nThey would complain in this way about Krsna. But then they would say, \"Oh we can't complain. Actually we're not angry. Your son just enchants us by His behavior, so we just can't stop thinking about Him and speaking about Him.\"\nThat's the nature of a mischievous child. He is always trying to get attention. If you don't give enough attention to a child he will simply become mischievous, and when he sees that everyone is looking, what does he do? He thinks, \"Ah now. I'm center stage.\" And he will put on a show for everybody.\nSo child Krsna and Nimai, They would do the same thing. They would perform mischievous activities to attract attention.\nOne time, this brahmana who was worshipping Gopal, came to the house of Jagannath Misra. He would travel everywhere. He had no residence. He would just wander about worshiping Gopal. He had a salagrama sila around his neck and he also had a little deity of Gopal. He was accustomed to eating the roots and wild things from the forest. He would offer them first to his deity and would then take the remnants.\nJagannath Misra became very much captivated by this brahmana's saintly qualities. He invited him into his home, welcomed him, bathed his feet, and worshiped him. He asked him, \"Brahmana, please tell me. Where are you from?\", and the brahmana described how he had no place of residence. He was simply accustomed to wandering about, worshiping the Lord.\nJagannath Misra said, \"Probably you have not eaten cooked food for a long time. Why don't you prepare some food and offer it to your deity while you are in my home?\" Jagannath Misra was not very wealthy at all. Externally he appeared to be living in poverty. Of course, we know what his wealth was. But although he was not wealthy he offered to this brahmana, \"Please let me gather all of the ingredients and then you can cook something and offer it to your deity.\"\nThe brahmana agreed and he took all of the ingredients that were offered by Jagannath Misra and his family members and he cooked a very nice offering for the pleasure of his deity. He then brought the offering before his deity, began meditating and offering his prayers to his worshipful Gopal. Young Nimai, who is none other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, when He heard the prayers of the brahmana, He came to that place where the brahmana was making his offering and immediately took some rice. He grabbed it in His hand, put it into His mouth and ate it.\nWhen the brahmana saw this, he said, \"What is this? This young boy has taken food that was meant to be offered to Gopal.\" When Jagannath Misra heard him call out loudly, he came to that place and saw Nimai eating the rice. He became very angry and he wanted to chastise Nimai for His mischievous behavior. So he was going to punish Nimai. But the brahmana said, \"No. No. No, Jagannath Misra. Please don't punish your child. He is only a young child. He cannot be held responsible for his actions. How can you hold a young child like this responsible for His actions? Please do not punish him. If you punish Him I will curse you.\" Of course, he didn't mean it, but that's what he said.\"\nBut Jagannath Misra accepted the words of the brahmana and wouldn't punish his child. The brahmana then said, \"It's not meant for me to eat cooked food today. I will simply take simple fruits, roots, and some berries. I will take that and I will offer it to my Deity. But Jagannath Misra said, \"No. I have invited you into my home. You are a guest in my home. I cannot be happy unless you allow me to provide you with all of the ingredients. Please cook one more time.\"\nThe brahmana replied, \"It is not necessary.\" But Jagannath Misra was very insistent. He said, \"No. Please. All of my family members and I will not be happy. It is our duty to serve the brahmanas like you.\" All of his family members went into the kitchen and cleaned it. They gathered the ingredients and said, \"Please come and cook.\"\nSo the brahmana agreed to cook again and went into the kitchen. This time they took Nimai and carried Him out. They said, \"We are not going to let Him stay here. Take him outside. Take Him to some other house. Keep Him busy.\" So they took Him out of the house. All the village ladies who were nearby heard about what had happened and they said to Nimai, \"Nimai now we don't even know what caste you belong to. We heard you ate this food but we don't even know who this brahmana is or where he comes from?\" He said, \"No. Don't you know I am a cowherd boy. I always eat food cooked by brahmanas.\" They laughed from His words, but actually He was revealing His identity though they could not recognize Him.\nSo they took Him to the other house and tried to keep Him busy. The brahmana, meanwhile, finished his cooking. He took all the preparations, put them before his deity of Gopal and then began making his offering by offering his prayers. Young Nimai who was the Supersoul in the heart of all living beings, bewildered everybody. He slipped away from next door and came into the house, completely unnoticed.\nHe came to where the brahmana was making his offering, He took the rice and put it into His mouth. The brahmana said, \"Haya! What is happening here?\" Jagannath Misra heard the brahmana screaming. He immediately ran to that place and saw Nimai eating the rice. \"This time\", he said, \"my son is going to be beaten for His activities.\" Jagannath Misra took a stick and began chasing his mischievous son. When Nimai saw His father coming after Him with a stick, He immediately ran into the other room. Misra said, \"You're not going to get away from me this time. I will beat You for what You have done. Who do You think You are for doing this, behaving in this way?\"\nThe brahmana stopped Jagannath Misra again and said, \"Oh Misra, please don't punish your child. It is not destined for me to eat cooked food.\" He said, \"Even if a person has millions of preparations in his home, if the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not order, he cannot eat a single one of them. He was speaking in this way.\nActually a similar expression was quoted many times before, that unless the Lord sanctions, even if somebody has so much food he cannot eat. In fact Lord Caitanya used that same example when He along with other devotees were traveling to Jagannath Puri. Lord Caitanya asked, \"Did anyone bring food or supplies?\" The devotees replied that they had no power to bring anything without His permission.\nThe Lord was happy with their reply and said, \"Even if a person has a house full of food but if he is sick with a fever, he cannot eat anything. So unless the Lord sanctions, one cannot eat, even though he may have so much food. If the Supreme Lord wills, one will always have food to eat.\"\nSo the brahmana was using this same argument. \"Krsna has not sanctioned it so I'm not destined to eat cooked food. So please accept it. Just bring me whatever you have. Some fruits, roots, whatever. I'm accustomed to eating very simply. Let me offer it my deity of Gopal and He will be happy. I will be happy.\"\nJagannath Misra was very despondent and began begging him, \"Please. No. You are my guest. At that moment, Visvarupa entered into the house. Visvarupa is the elder brother of Lord Caitanya. When the brahmana saw Visvarupa, he became so captivated by His countenance. He said, \"Who are the fortunate parents to have such a son who looks like this?\" Visvarupa came before the brahmana and submitted Himself before him. Then Visvarupa began explaining to him on the basis of scripture. \"It is the nature of a saintly person to be always happy to see others who are happy. And he's always very sad, when he sees others are in distress.\"\n\"Please you are a very saintly person. Look at my father. Look at my mother. Look how much distress they are in. They are so much distressed because you have not prepared cooked food and offered it to your deity. We know saintly people will be distressed to see others distressed. We know that you will only be happy if you see them happy. If you want them to be happy. Please cook one more time.\"\nThen Visvarupa got down and He touched the feet of the brahmana and He begged him, \"Please just one more time.\" The brahmana said, \"But four and a half hours of the night have already passed. Who cooks at this time of night?\" Visvarupa said, \"That's OK. No problem. We have all the ingredients here. They are all available. The kitchen is already clean. Go in the kitchen and you can prepare.\" The brahmana agreed, \"All right. I will do it one more time.\"\nSo it was early in the morning. He went into the kitchen and he began preparing one more time for his deity. Everyone said, \"This time take Nimai, put Him in the other room and bolt the door from the outside.\" So when the brahmana finished cooking and he was preparing to make his offering, the first thing he asked is, \"Where's your son?\" Everybody said, \"Don't worry. He's sound asleep. He won't even know what's going on.\"\nOf course, Nimai wasn't sound asleep. He knew everything that was going on. By His yogamaya potency, He put everyone else to sleep. While everyone was asleep and while the brahmana was making the offering, Nimai sneaked up to that place, reached over, grabbed some rice, took it and He put it into His mouth.\nThe brahmana said, \"Haya!!\", but nobody could hear him. They were all asleep. This time, Nimai spoke to the brahmana, \"Why don't you want Me to eat this rice? Don't you know. You called Me every time before and I came because you were calling Me. Don't you know that every time you call Me I come? Previously you visited the house of My father Nanda Maharaja. At that time you also cooked for Me, and I came and accepted your offering. You cannot remember, but I remember. I always come and take the food that is prepared by you. I am very eager to take food that is coming from the hand of My devotees.\"\nThe brahmana was overwhelmed. Then young Nimai manifested this most wonderful form. He manifested a form with eight arms. Four arms were holding the conchshell, club, disc and the lotus flower. With two arms, in one hand He was holding butter and with the other hand He was taking the butter and eating. And with the other two arms He was playing the flute. When the brahmana saw this most beautiful form of the Lord and He fell down to the ground and began crying tears of ecstasy. Lord Caitanya took His hand, He placed it on the head of the brahmana and said, \"Look at Me.\"\nThen the brahmana looked and saw that everywhere was Vrndavana. That same place which was always in his meditation was fully manifest before him. He saw the gopis, the cowherd boys, the kadamba trees and all the forest trees in Vrndavana. Everything was there. He became so overwhelmed seeing Vrndavana that he fell on the ground again.\nLord Caitanya said to the brahmana, \"Do not disclose anything that you have seen here today. If you do, I will destroy you. I have come here for a purpose. I have come to spread the sankirtan movement. I have appeared to disseminate the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord in this form. If you want to watch, then stay nearby. But don't tell anybody what you have seen here tonight.\"\nThen the Lord again assumed the form of Nimai and went to His room. The brahmana became so ecstatic, he took all the food that was prepared and began smearing it all over his body. Whatever food he could take, he would put it in his mouth. He began eating it, while smearing some on his body. He began screaming, \"Hare Krsna! Jaya Gopal!\" \nWhen everybody heard him calling out the names of the Lord, they all woke up. He realized that, \"I can't let them see what's happening.\" Quickly he had to clean up, take all the food off his body and ate whatever he could. Everyone came to that place and they were fully satisfied because they could see that he was fully satisfied having eaten the food that was cooked.\nThey were all happy because they thought that, \"This time the brahmana made his offering. He took the prasadam.\" The brahmana was thinking, \"If I tell everybody what I saw tonight, everyone will know, and they will all be liberated. They will all go back to the spiritual world.\" He wanted to tell everyone but then he restrained himself, \"I better not. The Lord told me not to say anything.\" \nSo this is another example of how the Lord didn't want to disclose His identity. He had His reasons. He wanted to remain hidden. He didn't want to appear as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But from time to time He would inspire those devotees who had previously worshiped Him birth after birth after birth, and He would disclose His identity as He did during the sata prahariya bhava, the ecstasy of twenty-one hours. At that time Lord Caitanya stood on the altar and revealed His divinity to His intimate devotees.\nIn principle, however, in this incarnation as Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Lord Caitanya appeared as a devotee and wanted to remain hidden. His desire was to remain hidden because He never wanted to disturb this mood of being a devotee of the Lord. But by the mercy of the Lord, anyone who came in contact with the Lord, could understand that He was the Supreme Lord.\nSuch was the magnanimity of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\nnamo maha-vadanyaya\nkrsna-prema-pradaya te\nkrsnaya krsna-caitanya-\nnamne gaura-tvise namah (CC Madhya 19.53)\nHe was the most merciful incarnation of the Lord, because He freely distributed what no other incarnation before would distribute. He came to distribute the highest ecstasy of loving devotional service in the mood of the residents of Vrndavana.\nJust like it's described in the beginning of Caitanya Caritamrita. Krsna appeared and displayed His pastimes with His eternal associates and He became conquered by His devotees in the various moods that they had, of servant, friend, parental affection and conjugal love.\nAs Lord Krsna He came and displayed His pastimes as the Supreme Lord and stayed for as long as He wanted. He then disappeared. Some time after His disappearance He thought to Himself. \"For a long time I have not bestowed upon the people of this world pure unalloyed devotional service. Without such loving attachment to Me, then this whole universe is useless.\"\nSo the Lord was thinking in this way that, \"It's been a long time since I have appeared to distribute the type of devotional service which is experienced by the devotees in Vrndavana.\"\nTherefore He said, I will come, \nyuga-dharma pravartaimu nama-sankirtana\ncari bhava-bhakti diya nacamu bhuvana (CC Adi 3.19)\n\"I will come, I will inaugurate the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord. I will make the world dance in ecstasy, realizing the four mellows of loving devotional service to Me.\"\nHe said, \"I will adopt the mood of a devotee and I will come and teach devotional service by practicing it Myself. Unless one practices devotional service himself, how can he teach it? This is concluded in all the scriptures such as Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam.\" And then He quotes the verses of Bhagavad-gita, \nyada yada hi dharmasya\nglanir bhavati bharata\nabhyutthanam adharmasya\ntadatmanam srjamy aham (BG 4.7) \n\"'Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion -- at that time I descend Myself.'\nparitranaya sadhunam\nvinasaya ca duskrtam\ndharma-samsthapanarthaya\nsambhavami yuge yuge (BG 4.8)\n\"'To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.' \nThen He said, \"If I did not teach by my example then the whole world would be put to ruination. I would be the cause of unwanted population and I would spoil all living entities.\"\nyad yad acarati sresthas\ntat tad evetaro janah\nsa yat pramanam kurute\nlokas tad anuvartate (BG 3.21) \n\"Whatever actions are performed by a great man, common men will follow in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by his exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\"\nThen He concludes, \"All the various incarnations of the Lord, the plenary portions of the Lord, They appear to establish religious principles in that particular age. But only I can come Myself and distribute this bhakti.\"\nSo the Lord said, \"I will have to come again.\" That is what Srila Prabhupada is explaining here in his purport. First He came as Krsna, but He had to come again. This time He had to teach by His example, so that the fallen people of this age could learn by seeing an example. Example is very important.\nPrabhupada even used to say that example is more important that precept. And therefore as we know that one of the great responsibilities for a preacher is that he is supposed to teach by his example.\nPrabhupada says in the commentary to that verse yad yad acarati sresthas, \"If a person is not an example then he cannot teach others.\" He even uses the example that if \"you are trying teach others not to smoke and you are smoking, how can you convince others?\"\nSo Lord Caitanya appeared to fulfill that same principle. He came to teach by showing Himself what is man-mana bhava mad-bhakto/ mad-yaji mam namaskuru. He came to teach by always being absorbed in thoughts of Krsna. Therefore He didn't like it when devotees would offer prayers glorifying Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore when Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya sent those verses to Lord Caitanya, Lord Caitanya took the palm leaves and ripped them up. He didn't want to be responsible for propagating in any way this conception of Himself as being the Supreme Lord. He simply wanted to be absorbed in this mood as a devotee of the Lord.\nA devotee can be even more merciful than the Lord. Prabhupada says that.\nWhen the Lord comes, sometimes He won't force. He is equal to everyone.\nsamo 'ham sarva-bhutesu\nna me dvesyo 'sti na priyah (BG 9.29)\nHe says, \nye yatha mam prapadyante\ntams tathaiva bhajamy aham (Bg 4.11)\n\"As you surrender until Me I will reward you accordingly.\"\nSo if somebody doesn't surrender, there is no relationship. Relationship is based upon surrender. So, especially in this age, nobody is inclined to surrender to the Supreme Lord. But Krsna very clearly establishes this principle, \"If you surrender, I will reciprocate.\" So the Lord is equal to everyone. But a devotee of the Lord understands the purpose of the Lord and therefore a devotee of the Lord can be even more merciful because the devotee will preach.\nEven though somebody is not inclined to surrender the devotee will give others the opportunity to surrender by giving them opportunity to come in contact with Krsna. Who could be more merciful than Lord Caitanya? He's a devotee. But He's Krsna. Both. Who could be more merciful? He's coming to preach, but He's Krsna Himself. Therefore He is most munificent. Because as the Lord He may sometimes be neutral. But Lord Caitanya is not neutral. Neither is He indifferent to others suffering. Lord Caitanya is so munificent that He is presenting Himself as a devotee to teach what is the highest principle and the highest ecstasy of how to love the Lord.\nAnyone who would see His love and His devotion, simply by seeing it, their hearts would melt. Tears would come from their eyes. They want to surrender. That's how merciful Lord Caitanya is. And what did Lord Caitanya give. If you surrender to Lord Caitanya, what do you get?\nyatha yatha gaura-padaravinde\nvindeta bhaktim krta-punya-rasih\n\"One who is extremely fortunate may get the mercy of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. As much as one can devote his full attention to the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya, to that extent he will be able to taste the nectarean service of the lotus feet of Srimati Radharani in Vrndavana. (Caitanya-candramrta 88)\nTherefore we offer our obeisances to Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\"May the Supreme Lord who is known as the son of Srimati Saci-devi be transcendentally situated in the innermost core of your heart. Resplendent with the radiance of molten gold, He has descended in the Age of Kali by His causeless mercy to bestow what no incarnation has ever offered before: the most elevated mellow of devotional service, the mellow of conjugal love.\" (CC Adi 3.4)\nSo therefore Lord Caitanya is most munificent.\nThank you very much. Hare Krsna. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu ki jaya! Sri Sri Gaura Nitai ki jaya! Sri Sri Doyal Nitai Vijay Gauranga ki jaya!\n","nid":"1169"},{
"title":"Crossing Over the Ocean of Material Existence - January 9, 2010, on the occasion of Vyasa Puja","ref":{"target_id":"1000"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Vyasa Puja"],"date":"Mon, 2010-02-15 14:55","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially edited transcript of the lecture delivered on January 9th, on the occasion of Vyasa Puja. The quotes within brackets [\u2026] are from Srila Prabhupada's purport to Srimad Bhagavatam, 10.2.31.\n\nHis Holiness Giriraja Maharaja mentioned last night that he wanted to liquidate some debts. I assume that he was referring to the questions that were asked of him. He felt that he had a debt, or responsibility, to the devotees who had asked those questions and to provide them answers to those questions.\nBut I took note that he also said that sometimes it's good to be in debt. He explained that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta would keep his disciples in debt so that they would always be endeavoring.\nSo in one sense, it's good to be in debt. But in another sense it's natural to try to liquidate our debts. Of course Prabhupada also says in the Bhagavatam that anyone who thinks he can repay the debt to the spiritual master is like a joker because there is no way that one can fully return the debt we have to our spiritual master.\nBut I was reflecting on that point with respect to the debt I have towards all of you who are offering words of appreciation, offering your service, and what to speak of, offering your hearts. Moreover that debt is always increasing.\nSometimes I find it overwhelming because I cannot properly reciprocate. I feel in debt to all the devotees for everything they are offering to me. But I'm also becoming increasingly aware that the offerings are not meant for me. I'm not supposed to accept them for myself.\nMoreover, I should not be like a person who accepts some appreciation or affection and then reciprocates that affection with a mercantile mentality.\nThis point was made in the discussion which took place between the gopis and Krsna when they described the different types of persons who offer affection. They described three types. The first type is the person who reciprocates the affection given to them with a mercantile mentality, \"Yes. I will give something back so that I will continue to get something from you.\"\nThe second type was those who offer their affection even to those who are indifferent or who show enmity towards them. And the third type is those who don't reciprocate at all.\nAnyways, we are not going to speak about this whole dialogue. It is not really the point I wanted to speak about this evening although it is a very wonderful dialogue between Krsna and the gopis where Krsna ultimately defeated the gopis by establishing the foundation of His loving reciprocation with them.\nBut I'm speaking specifically about the first type. When the gopis first inquired from Krsna what kind of lover He was, they asked. \"Are you the type of person who reciprocates affection because he expects to get something in return?\"\nSo certainly I do not want to be the type of person who accepts your affectionate offerings, accepts your service, and then reciprocates only so that I can continue to get something in return. Krsna clearly states that that is not love. He said that such a person is actually selfish and is thinking only of his own interests.\nStill sometimes I find it overwhelming. How do I reciprocate that affection and at the same time liquidate the debt? And even if I can somehow liquidate the debt, it seems that I am always accumulating more.\nThe only way that I can come even close to liquidating the debt is to fully realize that nothing is being offered to me. For your benefit I have to pass it on. Otherwise what benefit is there for you to worship me, to serve me, to offer words of glorification to me? If I don't pass it on, how will you benefit?\nI have to accept that position for all of you who have come here to offer your affection in this way. I may be able to temporarily liquidate that debt today by passing your offerings to Srila Prabhupada, someone who is obviously very, very dear to Lord Krsna. Then all of you get the benefit of giving affection, giving your service, giving your hearts to serving Srila Prabhupada and his mission.\nI was reading one very inspiring verse recently in the Tenth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam. I've read it many times before. It's a prayer by the demigods to Lord Krsna.\n\"O Lord, who resemble the shining sun, You are always ready to fulfill the desire of Your devotee, and therefore You are known as a desire tree [vancha-kalpataru]. When acaryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.\"(SB 10.2.31)\nThis verse is very wonderful verse, especially the way Prabhupada translated it. It helps us to understand what Srila Prabhupada left behind for us. This verse explains that the Lord is very much inclined to satisfy the desires of His devotees and therefore He is just like a desire tree. Srila Prabhupada, the great acarya who has fully taken shelter under the lotus feet of Krsna, crossed this fierce ocean of material existence and the Lord satisfied his desire by accepting the method by which he crossed.\nPrabhupada crossed the ocean of material existence and went back to the spiritual world. But he left behind the method by which he crossed. The Lord accepted that method. For whose benefit? Prabhupada translated, \"for Your other devotees\", those who are still here on this side. For our benefit the Lord accepted this method by which Srila Prabhupada crossed the ocean of material existence.\nBy hearing discussions about Srila Prabhupada from devotees who intimately served him and surrendered their lives to him, we can better understand what his method was. Just last night we were hearing about how the devotees were always absorbed in pleasing Srila Prabhupada through Sankirtan.\nIn fact, just this morning before I came here, I was listening to a lecture by Srila Prabhupada while I was taking breakfast. Prabhupada was quoting the first verse to the prayers of the Six Goswamis, \"krsnot-kirtana-gana-nartana-parau premamrtambho-nidhi, dhiradhira-jana-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau pujitau\"\nHe talked about the Six Goswamis and the previous acaryas, how they were always absorbed in chanting the names of Krsna. Then he said, \"Just like what you are doing right now, right here, this is what our previous acaryas were doing. They were absorbed in chanting Hare Krsna and you are absorbed in chanting Hare Krsna. Therefore what we are doing right now is authorized by our previous acaryas.\"\nIn fact Prabhupada said in the purport of the Bhagavatam verse I just quoted: \n[\"This statement reveals how the merciful acaryas and the merciful Supreme Personality of Godhead together help the serious devotee who wants to return home, back to Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in His teachings to Rupa Gosvami, said:\nbrahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva\nguru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija\n(Cc. Madhya 19.151)\nOne can achieve the seed of bhakti-lata, devotional service, by the mercy of guru and Krsna. The duty of the guru is to find the means, according to the time, the circumstances and the candidate, by which one can be induced to render devotional service, which Krsna accepts from a candidate who wants to be successful in going back home, back to Godhead.\"]\nPrabhupada explains here that Krsna accepts that method for the benefit of the candidate. The acarya finds the means according to the time place and circumstance by which others can be induced to render devotional service to Krsna. And Krsna accepts that from the candidate for devotional service. [\"After wandering throughout the universe, a fortunate person within this material world seeks shelter of such a guru, or acarya, who trains the devotee in the suitable ways to render service according to the circumstances so that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will accept the service. This makes it easier for the candidate to reach the ultimate destination.\"]\nJust as Krsna says: \ndaivi hy esa guna-mayi\nmama maya duratyaya\nmam eva ye prapadyante\nmayam etam taranti te\nThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it. (Bg 7.14)\nSo Krsna makes it easier. [\"This makes it easier for the candidate to reach the ultimate destination.\"] What makes it easier? When the Lord accepts it. If the Lord doesn't accept, then we can work so hard. But what is the value of so much work if the Lord will not accept?As explained in the Bhagavatam:\natah pumbhir dvija-srestha\nvarnasrama-vibhagasah\nsvanusthitasya dharmasya\nsamsiddhir hari-tosanam\n(SB 1.2.13)\nThe perfection of all activities is fulfilled when the Lord is ultimately satisfied by them. So Prabhupada has given us a method by which the Lord will accept it. He is the perfect acarya who knew how to apply the teachings, the siddhanta, of the scriptures according to time place and circumstance, and how to apply them in such a way so that his followers could perfect their lives, cross the ocean of material existence and go back to Godhead.We don't have to manufacture anything new. Prabhupada always emphasized that point. \"We are not manufacturing anything new. Our Krsna consciousness movement is authorized because we are following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas.\"\nIf we strictly follow in their footsteps and try to serve them and to satisfy them, then we can cross over this ocean of material existence by accepting the method they left behind for us to follow. Nothing new. Everything has already been given. So it makes it a lot easier when we don't try to manufacture something, try to change something, which has already been given by the previous acaryas. What makes it easy? If we simply try to satisfy them. Therefore I say that the best way I can liquidate the debt of the service, affection and love is to offer it to Srila Prabhupada. If Prabhupada is pleased by your service then certainly you will be following that method that he has left behind for you to cross this ocean of material existence. He has come to make the process of surrender easy. It's not very complicated. It's not very difficult. Just simply try to please him. That is all. In everything that we do, if we simply try to please him, then devotional service becomes easy. What makes it difficult is if we forget that.\nThat's what makes it difficult for me is when I forget that I'm supposed to pass everything on to him. Why does it make it so difficult? Because at every moment those debts keep on accumulating. And then I have to think about, \"How am I going to possibly pay back all of those debts? I can't. I'm a fool to think I can pay them back. It becomes a very, very complex, difficult formula if I start to think about how I can pay back every debt I accumulate at every moment when your affection, your words, your love, your service is being offered.\nSo it's not that I should only remember this point today. I can never forget to whom it's supposed to be offered. If I do, you won't benefit. Forget about all of the suffering I will have to experience by forgetting. But you won't benefit, because the whole purpose of the offering is to see that it gets to Srila Prabhupada's lotus feet. Krsna accepted his method because he has already demonstrated that he's crossed this ocean of material existence. And he so mercifully left behind that method for us. Prabhupada left that method behind for us and Krsna mercifully accepted that method to benefit us, the \"other\" devotees. Prabhupada said here [\"One can achieve the seed of bhakti-lata, devotional service, by the mercy of guru and Krsna.\"] [\"The acarya's duty, therefore, is to find the means by which devotees may render service according to references from sastra. Rupa Gosvami, for example, in order to help subsequent devotees, published such devotional books as Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. Thus it is the duty of the acarya to publish books that will help future candidates take up the method of service and become eligible to return home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord. In our Krsna consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and followed.\"]\nSo what was Prabhupada's other method for crossing? He left the method of chanting the holy names of the Lord and he left behind his books. He published his books to satisfy the order of his spiritual master Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, to satisfy the previous acaryas.\nSrila Prabhupada wrote in his concluding words in Caitanya Caritamrita, \"I'm feeling that my spiritual master is watching me. He is guiding me from within my heart.\" He quotes the first verse of Srimad Bhagavatam:\ntene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye muhyanti yat surayah\nJust as Lord Krsna impregnated all the Vedic wisdom from within the heart of Lord Brahma, in the same way Srila Prabhupada was describing how he felt his spiritual master was guiding his activities in his translation work of Caitanya Caritamrita and Srimad Bhagavatam.\nSo Srila Prabhupada left behind his books for the benefit of future generations to learn the process of devotional service as well as the means for expanding this same method for the benefit of others, by distributing those books. By chanting the holy names, studying the books of Srila Prabhupada and publishing and distributing these books, this is the method that he left behind for us to cross this ocean of material existence.[\"Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities -- illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling -- and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions. Because in the Western countries constant chanting is not possible, one should not artificially imitate Haridasa Thakura, but should follow this method. Krsna will accept a devotee who strictly follows the regulative principles and the method prescribed in the various books and literatures published by the authorities. The acarya gives the suitable method for crossing the ocean of nescience by accepting the boat of the Lord's lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed, the followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the Lord. This method is called acarya-sampradaya. It is therefore said, sampradaya-vihina ye mantras te nisphala matah (Padma Purana). The acarya-sampradaya is strictly bona fide. Therefore one must accept the acarya-sampradaya; otherwise one's endeavor will be futile. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings:\ntandera carana sevi bhakta sane vasa\njaname janame haya, ei abhilasa\nOne must worship the lotus feet of the acarya and live within the society of devotees. Then one's endeavor to cross over nescience will surely be successful.\"]\nSo I thought it would be appropriate to read that verse and to speak a little bit from Srila Prabhupada's commentary. I thought it would be a relevant way to, at least today, liquidate some of the debt that I've accumulated by offering everything to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada and by describing the method that he's left for us to cross this ocean of material existence.\nI pray that all of you can increase your endeavors to follow this method that Srila Prabhupada has given to us. This will be very pleasing to Srila Prabhupada and our previous acaryas and ultimately it will very much satisfy the Lord, which is the perfection of everything that we do.So there's more that I could say but I wasn't going to speak long. I thank you all for coming and for participating in this weekend's event. Tomorrow there will be more of this same method that Srila Prabhupada has given us to cross over the ocean of material existence.\nFor some of you, you will be taking your vows to chant minimum of sixteen rounds of Hare Krsna mahamantra and following the regulative principles, which as Srila Prabhupada spoke here, is a very important part of the process. \n[In our Krsna consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and followed. Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities -- illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling -- and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions.]\nWe'll also be hearing more about the glories of Srila Prabhupada from His Holiness Giriraja Maharaja so that all of us can continue to accumulate our debt that we have to offer to him. As we said, that's one debt that can never be liquidated and Prabhupada very mercifully and very kindly keeps us in that debt for our benefit so that we'll continue to reciprocate as best as we can to please him and to satisfy him, which is our only means for satisfying the Lord. Then crossing the ocean of material existence will become very easy.\nThank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n\nAn additional point (not mentioned in the lecture)\u2026\nThe following day, on January 10th, His Holiness Giriraja Maharaja forwarded the following quote to me from a letter Srila Prabhupada wrote in 1968. In the subject line, Maharaja wrote, \"accepting service, passing it on.\"\nHere is the quote:\n\"Your strong desire to serve me is very beautiful; your serving me means serving Krishna. I am also your servant, so I cannot accept your service from you or from any of my disciples. I accept service from my disciples on behalf of Krishna. Just like a tax collector must collect for the treasury, not for himself. If he himself touches so much as a farthing it would be unlawful. So I have no right to accept service from any disciple, but on behalf of Krishna I can accept. Sincere service to the spiritual master is service to the Supreme Lord. As stated in the prayer, yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado. Because Krishna accepts service through the via media of spiritual master, pleasing the spiritual master is equal to pleasing the Supreme Lord.\" (SP letter dated February 13, 1968)\n","nid":"1091"},{
"title":"By Nityananda's Will, Even a Fool Can Understand His Identity - January 31, 2010, Budapest, Nityananda Trayodasi","ref":{"target_id":"1057"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Gaura Lila","Nityananda"],"date":"Sun, 2010-02-07 07:44","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"2","body":"The following is a partially edited transcription of a lecture given in Budapest on January 31, 2010 on the occasion of Nityananda Trayodasi:\n\nAlthough Nityananda Trayodasi, the appearance day of Lord Nityananda, was a few days ago, we are observing it today. We already heard this morning in the song by Locan das Thakur, parama karuna, pahun dui jana, nitai-gauracandra, how these two worshipful Lords, Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda, appeared in this world to deliver the process of self-realization which is kevala ananda-kanda, a joyful process.\nBoth Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda appeared to fulfill the same purpose. Lord Caitanya appeared to distribute the holy name of the Lord and to answer the call of Advaita Acarya. Lord Nityananda appeared in this world to assist Him. Lord Caitanya is none other than Lord Krsna Himself. Brajendra nandana jei saci-suta hoilo sei, balarama hoilo nitai. Narottama das Thakur has described that Lord Caitanya is none other than the son of the King of Vraja and Lord Balarama is Nitai. They are the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord appears in many forms to fulfill many purposes.We oftentimes think of the verse in Caitanya Caritamrita which describes the Panca-tattva.\npanca-tattva -- eka-vastu, nahi kichu bheda\nrasa asvadite tabu vividha vibheda\nSpiritually there are no differences between these five tattvas, for on the transcendental platform everything is absolute. Yet there are also varieties in the spiritual world, and in order to taste these spiritual varieties one should distinguish between them. (Caitanya Caritamrita, Adi-lila 7.5)\nSo the Panca-tattva, They are Lord Caitanya, Lord Nityananda, Advaita Acarya, Srivasa Thakur and Gadadhara Pandita.\npanca-tattvatmakam krsnam\nbhakta-rupa-svarupakam\nbhaktavataram bhaktakhyam\nnamami bhakta-saktikam\nI offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, Krsna, who is nondifferent from His features as a devotee, devotional incarnation, devotional manifestation, pure devotee and devotional energy.(Caitanya Caritamrita Adi-lila 1.14)\nThese are five features of the Supreme Lord. I remember when I first joined the Krsna consciousness movement, we were distributing books which had just been published that year. These books were Adi-lila, Chapter seven of Caitanya Caritamrita. Srila Prabhupada published this before the whole Caitanya Caritamrita was published and called it \"Lord Caitanya in Five Features.\"\nSo these are five features of the Supreme Lord. Although Lord Caitanya is Krsna Himself, still He appeared in the Kali-yuga as the channa-avatara, as the hidden incarnation\u2014not as the Supreme Lord, but as a devotee of the Lord. His first expansion is Balarama, who is none other than Nityananda. Balarama assists the Lord in various ways, both in the spiritual world as well as in the matter of creation.\nSo if we are going to talk about Lord Nityananda we should know who Nityananda is. He is the first expansion of the Supreme Lord and He appears to assist the Lord in His pastimes. Just as Balarama appeared to assist Lord Krsna in His pastimes as His elder brother, that same Balarama appeared when Lord Caitanya appeared to assist Lord Caitanya in His pastimes as Nityananda. And just as when Lord Ramacandra appeared, that same personality also appeared as Laksmana to assist Lord Ramacandra in His pastimes. So Lord Nityananda is that same personality. Although He is the Supreme Lord, He appears in the mood of a servant of the Lord.\nTherefore we have to distinguish. On the transcendental platform these five tattvas are eka vastu, they are one in five. They are all absolute. But as we know in our Gaudiya Vaisnava philosophy, our Gaudiya Vaisnava siddhanta, our understanding is that although there is oneness, there is also difference. Lord Caitanya appeared to establish acintya-bhedabheda-tattva, inconceivable and simultaneous oneness and difference.\nSo when describing the Panca-tattva, Krsnadas Kaviraja Goswami explains in this verse we just quoted, panca-tattva eka vastu, that on the transcendental platform They are all one. But there is also variety in the spiritual world and in order to taste that variety one also has to see the difference. Taste comes from variety. There is no taste in oneness. If one wants to become one with the Supreme Lord, he thinks himself to be the same as the Supreme Lord. There is no relationship, which is the whole basis of rasa or taste. When there is relationship there is a manifestation of reciprocal love between the lover and the beloved. The lover desires to please the beloved. And there is also competition between the beloved and the one who is desiring to serve and to please the beloved, which is that the Lord, who is the supreme-most worshipable object, also desires to serve and please His devotees.\nTherefore when we read Caitanya Caritamrta, when we read Caitanya Bhagavata, when we read Bhakti Ratnakara, and when we read all the different literatures which describe the pastimes of Lord Caitanya, Lord Nityananda and Advaita Acarya, we see these loving relationships between Them.\nThe mentality that Lord Nityananda has when He appears in this world is that He is the servant of the Supreme Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He serves Lord Caitanya as His guru, He serves Lord Caitanya as His friend, and He serves Lord Caitanya as His servant, just as Lord Balarama played with Lord Krsna in these three different moods in Vraja. In all these ways He is absorbed in this mentality of serving. Every fiber and every atom of His existence is in total absorption of serving Lord Caitanya.\nLord Nityananda appeared in this world before Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared. As Maharaja explained this morning, He appeared in Ekachakra as the son of Hadai Ojha and Padmavati. He enjoyed His childhood pastimes in Ekachakra with His friends, playing and imitating many of Lord Krsna's childhood pastimes.\nLord Nityananda stayed in Ekachakra for twelve years and then He traveled to various places of pilgrimage for another twenty years. He waited there until it was time to meet Caitanya Mahaprabhu in Navadvipa.\nAlthough Lord Nityananda knew the purpose for which Lord Caitanya descended into this world, He did not preach while He was on pilgrimage even though He knew Lord Caitanya was going to appear in this world to propagate the congregational chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord and to induce the fallen conditioned souls to become lovers of God. Why did He wait? In Caitanya Bhagavata, Vrndavana das Thakur explains that Lord Nityananda waited because did not want to preach until He got the order to do so from Lord Caitanya.\nLord Nityananda thus established this relationship as a servant by demonstrating that only by first receiving the order from Lord Caitanya would He take up the initiative to display His pastimes of delivering the fallen souls.\nWhen Lord Caitanya appeared in Navadvipa, Nityananda was in Radha-desa, and at the moment of Caitanya Mahaprabhu's appearance, Nityananda gave out a loud roar which could be heard throughout the entire universe. It was so loud that even the residents of other planets were wondering, \"What was that sound?\" It was the sound of Nityananda's ecstasy that His worshipful Lord had appeared in this world.\nStill it was much later that Nityananda went to Navadvipa. He then stayed in the house of Nandanacarya and waited for Lord Caitanya to come and meet Him.\nAnyway, this shows how Lord Nityananda was a servant to the superior order given by Lord Caitanya. When Lord Caitanya gave Nityananda the order to preach then Lord Nityananda displayed His pastimes of traveling all over Bengal inducing the conditioned souls to take up the worship of Lord Gauranga.\nBhaja gauranga kaha gauranga laha gaurangera nama. This is a famous verse about Nityananda. Lord Nityananda would go out and He would sing this song. He would tell everybody, \"Please just worship Gauranga, bhaja gauranga, kaha gauranga, always speak about Gauranga, and take nama, laha gaurangera nama, take the name of Lord Gauranga with all devotion. Anyone who adores My beloved master Gauranga is more dear to me than My own life.\"\nThis is Nityananda. This is His mood. Of course Lord Nityananda was given the order by Lord Caitanya to go out and tell everyone He met, \"Worship Krsna, chant Krsna's name and make Krsna your life.\" But Lord Nityananda couldn't fully take up that order. Why couldn't He fully take it up? Because He was more inclined to tell everybody, \"Please chant the name of Gauranga.\" Take Gauranga's name, chant His name.\nOf course, Gauranga is Krsna. But Nityananda had a very confidential service that if one actually wanted to be able to approach Radha and Krsna in Vrndavana, first they had to get the mercy of Nityananda. Narottama das Thakur writes:\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe (from Prarthana)\nHe said \"When will that day be mine when Lord Nityananda will bestow His mercy upon me so that the desires for material enjoyment or sense gratification within my heart will become completely insignificant.\" So Narottama das Thakur was praying to get Lord Nityananda's mercy. What does it mean to get the mercy of Nityananda? One who receives the mercy of Nityananda means that he has no more material desires. Then Narottama das Thakur explained in the next verse:\nvisaya chariya kabe suddha ha 'be mana\nkabe hama herabo sri-brndabana\n\"When my mind is completely purified, free from material anxieties and desires, then I will be able to understand Vrndavana and the conjugal pastimes of Radha and Krsna and only then will be my spiritual life be successful.\"\nGetting the mercy of Nityananda means to become free from the desire for sense gratification because unless can become free from material desires it is not possible to understand Vrndavana dhama or the conjugal pastimes of Radha and Krsna. Therefore it is understood that Lord Nityananda is the original spiritual master because He does the cleaning work. He makes that person qualified to enter Vrndavana dhama. And the bona fide spiritual master is also understood to be the representative of Lord Nityananda.\nFor the inner circle of devotees, those who enter into Krsna's pastimes in Vrndavana and assist the Lord in His conjugal pastimes, for them, their guru is Srimati Radharani. She is also guru, because she trains up the devotees in their loving service to assist the gopis in pleasing Lord Krsna. Nobody can serve Krsna better than Radharani. She knows how to give Krsna pleasure. And therefore She is the guru for these inner circle of associates of the Lord in His pastimes in Vrndavana.\nBut Radharani will only accept those persons who are recommended to Her by Lord Nityananda. They work together. When Lord Nityananda certifies, \"Yes, he is free from material desires. He is fit.\" Lord Nityananda manifests His mercy by cleaning these desires from within the heart.\nJust like there's a pastime in Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya (it's a long pastime so I won't go into all the detail) how Jiva Goswami became qualified to enter into Vrndavana. Jiva Goswami received the mercy of Nityananda and after receiving His mercy, Lord Nityananda told Jiva Goswami, \"Lord Caitanya has given you the right to go to Vrndavana. Now that you have the right, you may go to Vrndavana.\"\nSo Jiva Goswami went and took permission from the all the exalted Vaisnavas, as well as Sacimata. He took the dust from their feet and he began his journey, leaving Navadvipa to go to Vrndavana. Just as he came to the outskirts of Navadvipa Dhama he fell down on the ground and offered his full dandavats to the Lord. When he offered his dandavats, within his heart manifested Govardhana Hill, Yamuna River and his uncles Rupa and Sanatana Goswamis.\nHe continued his journey and one night Lord Caitanya appeared to him in a dream. Lord Caitanya told Jiva Goswami. \"Now that you are going to Vrndavana, upon attaining Vrndavana, you should continue to worship me but in My form as Radha and Krsna. You should always meditate on My transcendental form of Radha and Krsna and together with your uncles you should all write transcendental scripture about devotional service.\nSo first he got the mercy of Nityananda, then he got the blessings from servants of Lord Caitanya, among whom Nityananda is the primary servant. Lord Nityananda not only gave Lord Caitanya's blessings to Jiva Goswami to go to Vrndavana, but He also placed His lotus foot upon his head and infused him with all transcendental potencies. First one gets the mercy of the servants of Lord Caitanya, then one gets the mercy of Lord Caitanya. Then, yatha yatha gaura-padaravinde. Prabodhananda Sarasvati explains that to the degree one worships Lord Caitanya and gets the mercy of Lord Caitanya, to that degree he will be able to understand the pastimes of Radha and Krsna in Vrndavana.\nSo Radharani will only accept as Her disciples those personalities who have been certified by Nityananda. They are qualified. Their hearts have become completely cleaned from all material desires. So that is the work of the spiritual master and Lord Nityananda is the original spiritual master. And this is another way that Nityananda assists the Lord by manifesting Himself as the original spiritual master, who is also nondifferent from Lord Balarama and who is the source of all spiritual strength. \nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be achieved by those who have no spiritual strength. Therefore Lord Nityananda, being nondifferent from Lord Balarama, also infuses spiritual strength within the heart of that devotee who gets His mercy and He also reveals His identity to such a person.\nKrsnadas Kaviraja Goswami explains in Caitanya Caritamrita, \"Let me offer my respectful obesiances to Lord Sri Nityananda Prabhu whose opulence is wonderful and unlimited. By His will, even the greatest fool can understand His identity.\" (Caitanya Caritamrita, Adi-lila 5.1)\nThis is a very important verse. Even a fool can understand Lord Nityananda's identity by Lord Nityananda's will. There are many examples in scripture of how Lord Nityananda manifests His will to reveal His identity.\nThere is a very nice story in Caitanya Bhagavata, how Lord Nityananda was very merciful to thieves. Lord Nityananda, ornamented Himself with all kinds of costly jewels. Some may say, \"Why would the Lord ornament Himself with diamonds, gold, silver, emeralds, and rubies, sapphires?\" And he was also wearing very costly silks. All different kinds of silk. He was literally a treasure house.\nOf course those who had material vision thought that this was Lord Nityananda's only treasure house\u2014 the gold, silver, and precious jewels. But the devotees of the Lord understand that Lord Nityananda's real treasure house is His love for Lord Caitanya. And because His love for Lord Caitanya is so great, He can control Lord Caitanya so much that even if Lord Caitanya wants to punish somebody or even kill them, if Lord Nityananda begs for Lord Caitanya to deliver them, Lord Caitanya cannot refuse. That is how powerful Lord Nityananda is.\nWe know the example of Jagai and Madhai. Lord Caitanya appeared before Jagai and Madhai calling, \"Chakra! Chakra! Chakra!\" He called His chakra to sever their heads from their body for their offense to Nityananda. But Lord Nityananda had a different plan. He said to Lord Caitanya \"No. Please. You've come to deliver the most fallen, so who could be more worthy recipients for your mercy than these two candidates? I have not at all been inconvenienced by being struck on the head. My blood was destined to come from My body. Please do not punish these two persons. Deliver them.\"\nThen Lord Nityananda told Lord Caitanya that Jagai stopped Madhai from taking an earthen pot and striking Nityananda again for the second time. Hearing that, Lord Caitanya said, \"You protected My Nityananda? You stopped Madhai from striking Him and protected Him.\"\nLord Caitanya became so overwhelmed that He embraced Jagai. When He embraced Jagai, then Jagai became infused with all spiritual potency. Jagai fell on the ground in ecstasy. Madhai and Jagai were like the same soul in two bodies. All the sins that Jagai committed, Madhai committed also. When Madhai saw Jagai rolling on the ground in ecstasy, he also became purified and was thinking, \"I want this too.\" He fell at the feet of Lord Caitanya and said, \"Please, we have both committed the same sins. Please give me what you have given to Jagai.\" Lord Caitanya said, \"Forget it. No. You struck My Nityananda. I will never give you the same.\" But then Madhai began pleading with Him. \"How can you abandon your own religious principles? Who can be more fallen than me?\"Lord Caitanya told him \"First you have to go to Nityananda and He has to forgive you.\" Nityananda then pleaded \"Please give Your mercy to Madhai.\"\nSo that is Nityananda's treasure house. His treasure house is that he wants to spread the glories of Lord Caitanya and therefore He wants to make Lord Caitanya known as Patita Pavana, as the uplifter of the most fallen. He took that order that was given by Lord Caitanya on His head.\nAnyway, I was talking about Lord Nityananda and the thieves and I got sidetracked by Jagai and Madhai. I should finish the story about Lord Nityananda and the thieves because it's another perfect example of how by Lord Nityananda's will, even the greatest fool can understand His identity. His method of distributing love of Godhead was such that He could induce anyone, even the offenders, to become lovers of God.\nSo, as we said, Lord Nityananda was wandering about, wearing all of these ornaments on His body. And I think the last point was a question, \"Why did He have all of these ornaments on His body?\" So when Lord Nityananda was wandering about Vrndavana as an avadhuta He gave His mercy to one Vaisnava in Govardhana. In return, this Vaisnava wanted to give very costly ornaments to Lord Nityananda. But Lord Nityananda said, \"Not now.\" So He didn't except them then. But at a later time He wanted to accept the offering of this devotee. At that time He decided, \"Now I will accept.\" So He told this devotee as well as other devotees, \"Bring whatever ornaments you wish to bring to Me.\" So they brought Him all of these costly jewels and ornaments and Lord Nityananda took everything and put them on His body.\nThere was a thief who was in charge of a big band of thieves. He was thinking that Lord Nityananda's treasure house was all the jewels that He was wearing. He and all the other thieves were worshiping Goddess Durga. Worshipers of Durga worship Her in order to obtain material opulences. So he told his band of thieves that, \"Our worship of Goddess Durga has now bore fruit. We don't have to travel everywhere to find costly things to steal anymore. By our worship of Goddess Durga, she has now taken everything and has put it all in one place. Just see how merciful she is! She has put all the wealth that one could possibly imagine all in one place.\"\nThis thief was thinking, \"We should steal these jewels from the body of Nityananda.\" So they devised a plan. At that particular time Lord Nityananda was staying at the home of Hiranya Pandita. While He was there He was fully absorbed in congregational chanting of the Holy names of the Lord and taking prasadam with the Vaisnavas. So this thief decided that he would go to the home of Hiranya Pandita at the appropriate time with his band of thieves and they would steal all of the ornaments from Nityananda's body. So he sent a spy to go see what they were doing. The spy went to Hiranya Pandita's house, he saw what was going on, then returned and gave his report to the thief.\nHe said, \"Right now, Nityananda is eating. Everybody else is awake. It would not be a very good time for us to go and to take the ornaments now. So the commander of the thieves said, \"OK, we will wait until nighttime when everybody is sleeping and then we will go in and will steal all of the ornaments.\" So they had to wait for the night to come. All of the thieves sat together on the outskirts of Navadvipa and waited. But by the influence of the Lord's yogamaya potency, all of them fell asleep. The next thing they knew they were hearing the sound of crows. The morning had come and it was broad daylight.\nAlthough the previous night they were all discussing amongst themselves which ornaments they wanted to take, it was already too late and nothing was taken. They had even planned which ornaments would go to which person. One of them had said, \"I will take the gold necklace.\" Another one said, \"I will take the pearl necklace. Another said, \"That's OK , you can take the necklace, I will take all the silver anklets.\" So although the previous night this was all discussed, now it was morning and they couldn't take anything.\nThey began fighting amongst themselves, blaming each other for having fallen asleep. \"It was your fault that we all fell asleep. Why didn't you stay awake and keep us all awake.\" And then somebody else said, \"You know it wasn't my fault, it was your fault.\" But the head thief said, \"What are we arguing about? There are many more nights to come. Why are we arguing about one night? Goddess Durga arranged that we would all fall asleep because we didn't worship her last night. So tonight we will worship her with wine and with meat and we will then be successful tonight.\"\nSo that night they worshipped Goddess Durga in their particular way and after performing their worship each thief cleaned his weapons, they put on dark clothes so that they would not be seen in the darkness of the night, and they all made their way to the house of Hiranya Pandita. When they arrived just nearby the house, they saw that the house was being guarded by very huge guards. They calculated that each guard was capable of killing a hundred thieves by himself. There were many of these guards surrounding the whole house. They were carrying weapons, they were chanting the holy names of the Lord, they were ornamented with tilaka, and they were all wearing garlands. Then the thieves started arguing amongst themselves again.\n\"Oh this Nityananda, I've heard that He's a very special personality, He must have these guards that we didn't know about protecting Him.\" And someone else said, \"I've heard that they call Him Gosai.\" And another said, \"How could He be Gosai, a controller of the senses? I've seen how much He eats. And why would He wear such costly jewels if He was a Gosai?\" Then the commander of thieves said, \"Maybe some important dignitary must be visiting the house of Hiranya Pandita and they brought their own personal guards with them? Whatever the reason, these guards are there and we can't attack now. Let's wait for some nights to pass, the guards will go away, and then we will be able to steal the ornaments.\"\nSo the commander said, \"Let's come back in ten days. \"They went about their business and ten days later they banded together again, each thief carrying five or ten weapons. This time there were no guards and they felt sure they were going to steal all of Nityananda's ornaments. All of them started approaching the house. Then all of a sudden it became pitch black and nobody could see anything. They began stumbling around in the dark. One thief fell into a big ditch and started getting bitten by mosquitoes and leeches. Another thief fell into a garbage pit. He was bitten by mosquitoes and scorpions. Another thief fell into thorns and his body was pierced all over with thorns. Another thief fell into a canal and another came down with an extremely high fever. His body was burning up.\nNobody could make any progress towards the house. Nobody could see anything. Just at that moment, all the clouds which had appeared in the sky began inundating torrential, freezing rain. They couldn't move and their bodies were freezing. They were ready to die. Then the rain turned into hail and they started being beaten by big hailstones. Practically all of them were on the verge of death. All of sudden, in the mind of the head thief, he began to think, \"This Nityananda cannot be an ordinary personality.\"\nHe started thinking about how all the events unfolded in the past, how they all fell asleep on the first night and therefore couldn't steal the jewels, and then how the all the guards were protecting the house and they couldn't steal that night either. So within his heart he began thinking, \"This Nityananda could be no one other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. My only redemption will be to take shelter of His lotus feet. The thief then prayed to Nityananda, \"When a person falls down onto the ground, he must take shelter of the earth. Similarly when a person offends You, He must take shelter of You by meditating on Your lotus feet.\" While he was meditating on the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda, all of a sudden the rain and the hail stopped. Light appeared and they were able to find their way out. Although they were on the verge of death, they all came back to life, simply by the thief's meditation on the lotus feet of Nityananda.\nThis thief decided to immediately go and take shelter at the lotus feet of Nityananda. Meditating on His lotus feet he went into the house of Hiranya Pandita, he fell on the ground. Tears were coming from his eyes. And then he got up, began dancing, and then fell at the feet of Nityananda. All the devotees were carefully watching this thief because they all knew who he was. One devotee warned, \"He's pretending. Don't trust him. Although he may look like he is surrendering to Nityananda, actually he has a scheme.\" Another one said, \"No we cannot minimize the potency of Nityananda Prabhu. Certainly He can deliver even the most fallen.\"\nNityananda said to the thief, \"Tell me. What is it that you are experiencing? Why are you behaving in this way? Have you received the mercy of Lord Krsna?\" The thief was lying on the ground, clasping the lotus feet of Nityananda. He said, \"I have offended You. I deserve to die. Whether I live or die does not make any difference. I have come to take shelter of Your lotus feet. You can kill me or You can let me live, whatever You like. But I've realized that I have committed a great offense to You.\" \nI wanted to rob Your jewels. On the first night when I tried to come and to steal Your jewels, I was prevented from doing so. We all fell asleep.\" Then he summarized everything that happened leading up to the point of his surrender. \"I have offended You and for this I should no longer maintain life in this body. I've simply come to beg forgiveness and now I should do what needs to be done. I am going to go and take my life by drowning myself in the Ganga.\nLord Nityananda said to the thief, \"I can understand, having heard of how much you have suffered, that you must be a servant of Lord Krsna and therefore you must have received the mercy of Lord Krsna.\"\nThis is a very important point. Nityananda was saying, \"By seeing how much you have suffered, you must be a servant of Lord Krsna.\" Someone might say, \"What kind of a statement is that?\"\nIt makes me think of a statement that Prabhupada once said on a morning walk in Tehran. Devotees were walking with Srila Prabhupada and Prabhupada stopped and turned to the devotees. He said, \"One will not be recognized as a great devotee of Krsna until he has been severely tested by Krsna.\" The devotees must have been thinking, \"What does that mean Prabhupada?\" Prabhupada began telling them, \"Just like Prahlada Maharaja, just like Haridas Thakur, Bali Maharaja, and the Pandavas. They were all severely tested and therefore they are known as great devotees.\"\nSo Prabhupada said on this morning walk, \"One will not be recognized as a devotee until he has been severely tested.\nSo Lord Nityananda is saying, \"Hearing how much you suffered I can understand that you are Krsna's servant and you have received Krsna's mercy. Of course it was obvious that he had received Krsna's mercy because the outcome is that he took shelter of Lord Nityananda and fully meditated upon His lotus feet.\nThen Lord Nityananda took the garland from around His neck and He placed it on the body of the thief. When He placed the garland on the thief's body, he became completely free from all material contamination. The thief began crying again and then Lord Nityananda took His lotus foot and He placed it on the thief's head.\nWhen Lord Nityananda placed His lotus foot on the thief's head, he became free from all offenses committed and became infused with ecstatic love for the Lord. Then Lord Nityananda told him, \"You do not need to take your life. You know so many thieves. All the thieves know who you are. You were the king of thieves. Now you should go and meet all of these thieves and you should tell them about Lord Caitanya's mercy. If you do this, if you tell everyone about the mercy of Lord Caitanya, then your life will be completely successful.\nSo by Lord Nityananda's will, even the greatest fool can understand His identity. Lord Nityananda makes His identity known to whomever He gives this mercy. So we may think, \"How will we get mercy?\" Lord Nityananda is very expert. He knows how to give that mercy. Even if He sees one tear in the eye when one is chanting the name of Gaura, He is very much inclined to give His mercy to that person. There may be different reasons why those tears manifest. But however they manifest, if one remembers the lotus feet of the Lord, then Lord Nityananda is very much inclined to bestow His mercy.\nPrabhupada says in the Bhagavatam that a man displays two types of tears. When he is suffering, his tears will be hot. But when he is happy his tears will be cold. Either hot or cold, but when a Vaisnava is happy due to receiving the mercy of Lord Nityananda, his tears will be cold.\nSo if one chants the names of Gaura and one has a tear in his eye, then Lord Nityananda is very much inclined to give His mercy to that person, to bestow upon him the pure Holy Name. What is the price one must pay for purchasing that Holy Name? The price one must pay is faith.\nTherefore, Vrndavana das Thakur ends this pastime in Caitanya Bhagavata by saying that anyone who hears this pastime of Lord Nityananda in His distribution of mercy to the thieves, with faith, will see Lord Caitanya face to face in this life. That is the price one must pay. If we simply give our faith to Lord Nityananda, that is all that He asks.\nLord Nityananda is so merciful that when you pay with your faith He gives it all back to you so that you can come back and buy more. Who does that? When you go and purchase something, you pay for it, they take your money and say \"Here is your commodity,\" and that's it. But Nityananda is very merciful. You pay with your faith and then what does He do? He gives it back so that you will come back and purchase more faith. If you pay with sraddha, a little faith, then sadhu-sanga, then bhajana kriya, anartha nivritti. He gives it back so that you can come back and get more\u2014 ruci, asakti, bhava and then prema. We just have to keep on giving our faith. That is the currency which Lord Nityananda accepts in the marketplace of the Holy Name.\nSo anyone who hears this pastime of Lord Nityananda and the thieves with faith, he will certainly see Lord Caitanya face to face in this life. That is the mercy of Nitai. He who has come in this most merciful form to assist His worshipful Lord in rescuing the fallen conditioned souls of this age of Kail-yuga. Both Nitai and Gauracandra have arisen on the horizon of Gaudadesa to distribute this mercy, pure devotional service to Krsna. \nLord Nityananda is very eager to make us qualified by removing all material obstacles on the path of devotional service so that we will become free from the desire for sense gratification. Only then, when our minds are completely purified, freed from material desires and anxieties, will we be able to understand Sri Vrndavana Dhama and the pastimes of Radha and Krsna in Vrndavana. And only then will our devotional service be successful. So we should pray today for this mercy from Nitai.\nI want to read just one short thing to conclude our talk. Srila Prabhupada in his commentary to Gauranga Bolite Habe says:\n\"Ara kabe nitai-cander koruna hoibe. We are all asking about the mercy of Lord Nityananda. Nityananda is supposed to be the original spiritual master, so we have to approach Gauranga, Lord Caitanya, through the mercy of Lord Nityananda. What is the symptom of a person who has achieved the causeless mercy of Lord Nityananda? Narottama dasa Thakura says that the symptom of one who has actually received the causeless mercy of Lord Nityananda is that he has no more material desire. Ara kabe nitai-cander koruna hoibe samsara-basana mora kabe tuccha ha'be. Samsara-basana means \"desire for material enjoyment,\" and Narottama dasa wonders when it will become very insignificant. Of course, as long as we have bodies we have to accept so many material things, but not in the spirit of enjoyment, but only to keep body and soul together. (Purport to Lalasamayi Prarthana)\nThat is Prabhupada's explanation of \"no more material desire.\" What is that verse? \nyavad bhriyeta jatharam\ntavat svatvam hi dehinam\nadhikam yo 'bhimanyeta\nsa steno dandam arhati (SB 7.14.8)\nOne should desire as much wealth necessary to maintain body and soul together. One who desires more than that is to be considered a thief (we just heard what happens to thieves) and deserves to be punished by the laws of material nature. That is Narada Muni's statement to Yudhisthira Maharaja. The Seventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam about ideal householder life. OK. I think we should end here. Hare Krsna.\n","nid":"1067"},{
"title":"The Mercy of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda - March 25, 2005, Gaura Purnima","ref":{"target_id":"16042"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Gaura Lila"],"date":"Sat, 2010-01-30 12:08","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"1","body":"The following is a partially edited transcription of a talk given in Mayapura on March 25, 2005, on the day of Gaura Purnima.\n \nI would like to read from the first part of this purport given by Srila Prabhupada on the bhajan called \"Savarana-sri-gaura-mahima\", which means \"The Glories of Sri Gauranga.\"\n \n\"This is a song by Narottama dasa Thakura in praise of the glories of Lord Caitanya. Gauranga refers to Lord Caitanya, who has a fair complexion. One who has a fair complexion is called gaura, and since Lord Caitanya was very fair, just like molten gold, He was also named Gaurasundara. Narottama dasa Thakura says, gaurangera duti pada, jar dhana-sampada, se jane bhakati-rasa-sar. Anyone who has accepted the two lotus feet of Lord Caitanya can understand the true essence of devotional service. Devotional service is very difficult. It cannot be understood by any ordinary man. As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, out of many thousands of persons who are trying to achieve the perfection of human life, only some actually become perfect and realize the self. And out of many thousands of such self-realized persons, only one can understand Krsna. Without understanding Krsna, how can one engage himself in the service of Krsna? Therefore, the devotional service of Krsna is not an ordinary thing. But fortunately, if one follows in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya (gaurangera duti pada) by following the path shown by Lord Caitanya -- the process of simply chanting Hare Krsna -- he can very easily understand what devotional service is. Therefore, Narottama dasa Thakura prays that one take shelter of Lord Caitanya and follow in His footsteps, for then one can understand the essence of devotional service.\" [end of commentary]\n \nSo in this song, Narottama das Thakur is emphasizing that one can understand devotional service if one accepts the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya. Otherwise as Srila Prabhupada explains in his commentary, devotional service is not such an easy thing to understand. In fact, for an ordinary man it is very difficult to understand because bhakti is eternal and has nothing to do with this material world. Just as Krsna is eternal, devotional service to Krsna is also eternal. It has no beginning and no end. Therefore for an ordinary, materialistic person, who is conditioned by the modes of material nature, it is very difficult for him to understand what is devotion.\n \nIn Caitanya Caritamrita, Krsnadas Kaviraj Goswami writes, \"I offer my obeisances to Lord Caitanya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Who is an ocean of transcendental mercy and although the subject matter of bhakti is very difficult to understand, Lord Caitanya has made this understanding very easy, very accessible to the fallen souls of the age of Kali.\"\n \nSo ordinarily this bhakti, or devotional service, is very hard to understand. I remember sometimes in the days when I would go out regularly on book distribution, people would frequently to ask the questions, \"Why are you doing this? Are you getting paid for this?\" When I would answer, \"No\", they would then ask, \"Then why are standing here, doing this all day?\" Especially sometimes when we would stand in the freezing cold or in the pouring rain, people would ask this question. It's understandable. When somebody is making such sacrifices, working hard, people think that there must be some fruit. So naturally the first thing they ask is, \"How much do you get paid for this?\" Working like that without pay is a mystery to them. They cannot understand. Srila Prabhupada would oftentimes explain that in order to understand the mystery of bhakti or devotional service, one should not try to understand like a person who tries to taste honey by licking the outer surface of the bottle.\n \nIf one wants to understand the sweet taste of honey then one has to open the bottle and taste the contents inside the bottle. Similarly if one wants to understand the nature of devotional service, one has to associate with a devotee of the Lord. Of course, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appears in this age of Kali as the hidden avatara, in the form of a devotee of the Lord to teach devotional service by practicing it Himself. In other words, He has come to teach by His own example.\n \nPrabhupada explains that previously when Lord Krsna appeared, Lord Krsna gave the instruction that first one must surrender to Him.\n \nsarva-dharman parityajya\nmam ekam saranam vraja\naham tvam sarva-papebhyo\nmoksayisyami ma sucah\n(Bg 18.66)\n \nHe instructed, \"Abandon all varities of religion and just surrender unto Me.\" And he said that when Lord Caitanya appeared, Lord Caitanya removed that condition. The only request He made is, \"You simply take what I am offering.\" That is all. \"You must simply take.\"Previously when Lord Krsna came He also instructed:\n \nman-mana bhava mad-bhakto\nmad-yaji mam namaskuru\nmam evaisyasi satyam te\npratijane priyo 'si me\n(Bg 18.65)\n \nHe taught this instruction in such a way, that \"One should always think of Me, worship Me, offer your obeisances unto Me.\" But when Lord Krsna gave this instruction, He taught it in a theoretical way and therefore He had to appear once again as Caitanya Mahaprabhu to teach it by His own example. This time He appeared as the topmost devotee Who is always absorbed in thoughts of Krsna.\n \nTherefore we understand that one of the reasons for the Lord's appearance as Caitanya Mahaprabhu was to take this position of the devotee of the Lord. He wanted to understand the position of that topmost devotee. He also wanted to understand the transcendental mellows about Himself which He could not understand otherwise. And He wanted taste that bliss that Srimati Radharani Herself was tasting.So these are the internal reasons for the appearance of the Lord. And as we know, there are also external reasons for the Lord's appearance too. The Lord appeared to propagate the congregational chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord as the primary means for achieving this perfected state of consciousness. And He also came to answer the call of Advaita Acarya. Advaita Acarya appeared in this world prior to the appearance of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When He saw the fallen condition of the residents of Kali, He was thinking that only the Lord Himself can deliver these people from their nescience. So He offered prayers and called out the name of the Lord and invoked the Lord to appear in the form of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n \nSo these are the different reasons for which Lord Caitanya appeared. But as we explained, Lord Caitanya also appeared to make this subject matter, which ordinarily is a mystery, easily accessible. Taking into consideration the condition of the residents of Kali Yuga, He appeared to distribute the most sublime method for realization of the Lord.Sivarama Maharaja was referring to the verse spoken Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, who glorifies Lord Caitanya as the ocean of mercy and Who has appeared in this age to teach devotion to Himself and detachment from everything that has nothing to do with Krsna. So the Lord has appeared for these purposes.Regarding the point that this subject matter of devotional service is very difficult to understand for nondevotees, we were speaking about something on a previous night which is very, very relevant to this point. Unless one establishes a relationship with Lord Caitanya, it is very difficult to understand Him.Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur was explaining in his Navadvipa Dhama Mahatmya how those who come to the dhama cannot fully understand their relationship with Lord Caitanya. There is a covering of the dhama, which is called praudha-maya.I'll read a little bit from this section.\n \n\u201cThat blissful place, transcendental to material nature, rests on Krsna's inconceivable and supremely magnanimous sandhini energy. By that energy the dhama has descended here in Nadia, for Krsna's real desire is to deliver the living entities. Materialistic persons cannot enter the dhama, nor is there any material influence here. Maya has eternally covered the dhama with a film of dull matter. People who have no relationship with Krsna Caitanya simply live on top of that covering, blind to the real truth. Though one is thinking, 'I am in Navadvipa,' Praudha Maya happily keeps that person far away from the dhama. But if by some great fortune one receives the association of a devotee, that relationship, or sambandha, with Sri Caitanya will be established.\n \n\u201cThis topic of sambandha is a deep thing, O son of Vallabha, a treasure that the conditioned souls cannot easily understand. Even if one calls out the name of Sri Krsna Caitanya with seeming affection, if that relationship is not established in his heart, he simply remains in the material realm. Such a person resides on top of the dhama's illusory covering and never attains pure bhakti. That person is the dharmadhvaji, or hypocritically devout, who is especially duplicitous, who has no humility and is full of pride, yet still thinks he is fully qualified.\"[end of quote]\n \nSo Bhaktivinode Thakur is herein explaining that unless one gets the association of a devotee of the Lord, it will be impossible to establish his relationship with Lord Caitanya. He will simply stand on top of this covering but he will never understand that mystery of devotional service. And who are those persons who are bereft of this understanding? Those persons who have no humility, who are full of pride, and who still they think that they are fully qualified. But, Bhaktivinode Thakur emphasizes one very important point, that by the mercy of a devotee, even a proud person can give up his pride and perform devotional activities. Having achieved this mercy of a devotee, one should then think himself to be lower than the blade of grass, more tolerant than the tree. He should not desire respect for himself, but should offer respect to all others. When one possesses these four qualities and sings the glories of Lord Krsna, his relationship with Sri Caitanya will manifest within his heart.In other words, this is how one must establish sambandha, our relationship with the Lord. He must get his relationship by coming in contact with a devotee.\n \nNow this is Lord Nityananda talking Jiva Goswami (O son of Vallabha) on parikrama in Navadvipa. After completing Navadvipa Mandala Parikrama, Lord Nityananda is giving these instructions. He says that with Krsna there are five types of relationships, but with Lord Caitanya the relationship is primarily of dasya, a servant. One must think himself to be a servant of Lord Caitanya.\n \nBy the mercy of a devotee of the Lord, one can establish that relationship with Lord Caitanya. It is described that Jiva Goswami, although he previously had contact with Lord Caitanya, he was instructed to go to Navadvipa to take shelter of Lord Nityananda and to obtain His mercy. Lord Nityananda took him on parikrama throughout Navadvipa dhama and then told him that having now gone on parikrama, Lord Caitanya will bestow upon him the right to enter into Vrndavana. One who takes shelter of Lord Nityananda who is the greatest devotee of Lord Caitanya and who develops or cultivates this consciousness of trnad api sunicena, taror iva sahisnuna, and who always hears the glories of Krsna, then his relationship with Lord Caitanya will become established in that way.\n \nSo then after instructing Jiva Goswami, Lord Nityananda told him, \"Now you have the right and now you can go to Vrndavana.\" Because by rendering service to Lord Caitanya, yatha yatha gaura padaravinde, vindeta bhaktim krta-punya-rasih. \"To the degree that one renders service to Lord Caitanya to that degree he becomes qualified to understand Radha and Krsna's pastimes in Vrndavana.\" So it is Lord Nityananda who does the cleaning. He does the preparation work. He makes one qualified to establish his relationship with Lord Caitanya. Even the offenders were delivered by the mercy of Lord Nityananda.\n \nSometimes Lord Caitanya will not accept everyone. Sometimes He will not accept offenders. But Lord Nityananda has no discrimination. He is so merciful that even the offenders can be delivered. When Lord Nityananda petitions Lord Caitanya, \"Please bestow your mercy upon them!\", Lord Caitanya cannot refuse. How can He refuse when Nityananda is crying with tears, begging, \"Please you've come to deliver the most fallen. Look at these two, Jagai and Madhai. Certainly they are qualified for Your mercy.\" That was Lord Nityananda's mercy. He made them qualified for Lord Caitanya's mercy.\n \nSo then as we explained, one who established his relationship with Lord Caitanya can gradually become qualified to enter Vrndavana. Just like when Jiva Goswami received this instruction from Nityananda, Lord Nityananda said, \"Now you have received from the Lord the right to go to Vrndavana.\" Then Jiva Goswami fell down on the ground in ecstasy. Lord Nityananda placed His lotus feet upon his head and infused him with transcendental potency.\n \nSo after receiving that potency from Lord Nityananda, then Jiva Goswami went to Mother Saci to also get her permission. Sacimata gave her blessings, \"Now you may go to Vrndavana.\" Then Jiva Goswami began his journey to Vrndavana. When he came to the outskirts of Navadvipa, he offered his dandavats and at that moment, within his heart appeared Sri Vraja Dhama, the Yamuna River and Rupa and Sanatana Goswamis. Continuing his journey, one night Lord Caitanya appeared to him in a dream. The Lord said, \"You and your uncles Rupa and Sanatana, you are all very, very dear to me. Now please go to Vrndavana and dedicate your service to Me in the form of Radha and Krsna. Always fix your consciousness upon My pastimes in Vrndavana in My form as Radha and Krsna. You and your uncles should also write transcendental literatures and you should reveal all of this to the world.\n \nSo it is described that this is the means by which one can become qualified to enter into Vrndavana. Just as Narottama das Thakur describes in \"Gauranga Bolite Habe:\n \nara kabe nitaicandera karuna ha-ibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n \n\"When will that day come when Lord Nityananda's causeless mercy is bestowed upon me so that my desire for material enjoyment becomes very insignificant?\"\n \nPrabhupada explains in reference to this verse.\n \n\"We are all asking about the mercy of Lord Nityananda. Nityananda is supposed to be the original spiritual master. So we have to approach Gauranga, Lord Caitanya, through the mercy of Lord Nityananda. What is the symptom of a person who has achieved the causeless mercy of Lord Nityananda. Narottama das Thakur says that the symptom of one who has actually received the causeless mercy of Lord Nityananda is that he has no more material desires. Ara kabe nitaicandera karuna ha-ibe, samsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe. Samsara-vasana means, desire for material enjoyment. And Narottama das wonders when will it become very insignificant.\"And then Prabhupada says, \"Of course as long as we have bodies we have to accept many material things. But not in the spirit of enjoyment. But only to keep body and soul together.\"\n \nSo Prabhupada is qualifying that statement. What does it mean to have no more material desires? So we may accept so many material things\u2014 not for material enjoyment, but simply to maintain the material body\u2014 to keep body and soul together.\n \nSo it is Lord Nityananda who awakens this faith in Lord Caitanya. It is described by Bhaktivinode Thakur in his \"Godruma Kalpatavi\" and he also describes a similar point in \"Dalaler Gita.\" How is Lord Nityananda distributing the Holy Name of the Lord in the marketplace of the Holy Name? Simply for the price of one's faith one can purchase that pure Holy Name. When anyone accepts the pure Holy Name with faith, then he can establish his relationship with Lord Caitanya. Even for those who have no faith, Lord Nityananda is so merciful that by His method of distribution, He awakens that faith. He awakens that faith in Gauranga with tears in His eyes, falling on the ground, begging, pleading, \"Please, simply take this name.\" He is not asking for anything else except to simply take.\n \nBy this method, Lord Nityananda gives a little sample of this faith. Bhaktivinode Thakur explains that faith is the price one must pay in the marketplace of the Holy Name. There is no other currency accepted in that marketplace. If one tries to purchase the Holy Name with material money, material wealth, one will not be able to get the pure Holy Name. The only currency exchanged in this marketplace is faith.\n \nSo if you give Lord Nityananda just a little faith, then Lord Nityananda is so merciful. What does He do? After you've chanted the prescribed times of the Holy Name with a little faith then Lord Nityananda gives back exactly what you paid so that you can come back and purchase more. This is how one establishes his relationship with Lord Caitanya. By the mercy of Lord Nityananda, what does He do? He cleans away all material desires. If one gets the association of a devotee of the Lord, who is a representative of Lord Nityananda, or as Bhaktivinode Thakur is explaining here, if one gets that association with a devotee, he can still become free from pride. Even those persons who are so proud, who think themselves fully qualified, and have no humility, still they can become free from pride.\n \nSo Lord Nityananda, or the representative of Lord Nityananda, helps to clean away these unwanted desires from within the heart. As long as there's pride, as long as one does not feel himself to be lower than the straw in the street, as long as he cannot offer respect to everyone and give up the foolish poison of expecting or wanting respect for one's self, he can never have a relationship with Lord Caitanya. No sambandha. And without the mercy of Lord Caitanya, one can never understand Radha and Krsna in Vrndavana.\n \nSivarama Maharaja was so nicely presenting this point, that this is how one becomes qualified to enter Vrndavana Dhama. One has go through Lord Caitanya. Of course, we have also added another dimension that we should try to go through Lord Nityananda to establish our connection with Lord Caitanya. And we accept the representative of Lord Nityananda, the devotee of the Lord, the Vaisnava, who helps us to clean the heart so that we can get Lord Caitanya's mercy. Then we can get that relationship. Then we can understand Lord Caitanya. And then we can understand what is real devotional service. What is the devotional service that Lord Caitanya Himself came to give all of us?\n \nyuga-dharma pravartaimu nama-sankirtana\ncari bhava-bhakti diya nacamu bhuvana\n \n\"I shall personally inaugurate the religion of the age -- nama-sankirtana, the congregational chanting of the holy name. I shall make the world dance in ecstasy, realizing the four mellows of loving devotional service.(CC, Adi-lila 3.19)\n \nLord Caitanya appeared to distribute the method of religion in this age of Kali, the congregational chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord. And He came to establish ecstatic loving devotional service to Him, cari bhava-bhakti diya, these four types of ecstatic loving service to Lord Krsna. One can never understand these four ecstatic, loving types of service to Lord Krsna unless he becomes a servant of Lord Caitanya.When Lord Caitanya appears with all of His associates, all of His associates appeared in the mood of service to Lord Caitanya.\n \npanca-tattva -- eka-vastu, nahi kichu bheda\nrasa asvadite tabu vividha vibheda (CC Adi-lila 7.5)\n \nThat spiritually there is no difference between these five tattvas because on the transcendental platform everything is absolute. Yet because there is variety in the spiritual world, one must make a distinction in order to taste these different types of relationships. What is the relationship that all of Lord Caitanya's associates have? They are thinking, \"I am a servant! I am a servant! I am a servant of Lord Caitanya!\"\n \nIt was Advaita Acarya who became ecstatic when he finally achieved that most precious, valuable gift of becoming a servant of Lord Caitanya when Lord Caitanya punished and beat Him. \"Now my life is finally fulfilled. He has accepted Me as His servant. Previously He was always giving Me respect as His master, as His superior.\" Advaita Acarya began preaching Mayavada philosophy so that Lord Caitanya would come and punish Him. And when Lord Caitanya heard this philosophy of Advaita Acarya, He came before Him, He grabbed Him and pulled Him down from his seat. And Sitadevi was saying, \"Stop! Stop! He's an old man! Please don't beat Him!\" And while Lord Caitanya was pulling Advaita Acarya, He was lying there in complete ecstasy. \"I'm His servant! I'm His servant! Why else would He beat me in this way unless I'm His servant?\"\n \nSimilarly Lord Nityananda\u2026 every fiber, ever atom of existence is complete absorption in service to Lord Caitanya.\n \nSo we should seek the mercy of the devotees of the Lord and make all effort to develop these qualities as described in trnad api sunicena, taror iva sahisnuna.\n \nIt was Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur who said that this verse of Siksastakam is the siddha-pranali of all Gaudiya Vaisnavas. This is our method of achieving perfection.\n \nSo we should take shelter of the devotee of the Lord. Just like Jiva Goswami, after he was infused with transcendental power, being touched by the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda, all the Vaisnavas came and they assembled in that place. Then one by one, Jiva Goswami went to all of these Vaisnavas whom he considered superior, and begged them, \"Please give me your blessings so that I may become qualified to enter into Vrndavana.\" He said, \"Only if I can get the dust of the lotus feet of all of these wonderful associates of Lord Caitanya can I ever have hope to understand and to achieve Sri Vrndavana Dhama.\n \nSo we should give all respect to Vaisnavas. Take the dust from their feet. We should very fervently pray for this mercy so that we can get rid of this pride and this desire for respect and prestige. And if on such an auspicious day as the appearance day of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we can develop some enthusiasm and taste to hear the pastimes of the Lord in the association of His devotees, we can then establish this sambandha, this relationship with Lord Caitanya. Then this covering, this film, which is covering Navadvipa dhama can be removed and we can actually enter into the dhama and get the mercy of Lord Caitanya.What is that verse?\n \nese brndabane radha-syamer pa'be darasan\ngaura-krpa ha'le he (Sri Nam Kirtan, Bhaktivinode Thakur)\n \n\"If one gets the mercy of Lord Caitanya, He will receive the beautiful vision of Radhe and Syama in Vrndavana\"\n \nSo one who worships the Lord in this way, through the servant of the servant of the Lord, then he can purify his heart and become qualified to understand this devotional service that Lord Caitanya came to distribute freely to everyone. Otherwise it will simply remain a mystery. We will never be able to understand. We will be licking the outside of the bottle of honey trying to understand the sweetness of the honey inside.\n \nLord Caitanya raised His arms and declared to everyone that, \"You should give up your envy of all living entities and respect everyone and then you will be able to achieve the mercy for which I have come to distribute.\" So this is one of the purposes for His divine descent. And this is what Srila Prabhupada is trying to help us understand in his explanation to this wonderful bhajan by Narottama das Thakur. Hare Krsna.\n \n","nid":"1055"},{
"title":"Transcription of \"The Importance of Book Distribution\", a lecture given at the Sankirtan Festival in Budapest, January 2, 2010","ref":{"target_id":"983"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Book Distribution","Marathon"],"date":"Tue, 2010-01-26 12:41","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially edited transcript of a talk given in Budapest on January 2, 2010, on the occasion of the Hungarian Book Distribution Festival after the Prabhupada Marathon.\nA formatted version of the talk is available for downloading at the bottom of the page.\n \nSo, I have been asked to speak about a particular topic today which is relevant to the occasion that we have all gathered to observe. I've been asked to speak about importance of book distribution. I find it a little ironic that I am sitting on this side speaking to you about the importance of book distribution. I think it should be the other way, because the most of you have already demonstrated by your activities in this previous month, that you've realized the importance of book distribution. You can therefore speak from realization, whereas I can speak only from a platform of theory. \nBut certainly, I can also repeat the words of Srila Prabhupada, which are just as potent now as they were when he spoke them; about the importance of book distribution. Before the marathon started, we gave a talk on Sunday about Prabhupada\u2019s emphasis on book distribution during his manifest presence in this world. Srila Prabhupada always placed great emphasis on the importance of establishing this Krsna consciousness movement on the authority of his books. \nHe spoke about that, but he also demonstrated by his own example, as shown by the amount of time he dedicated every day for translating. Wherever Srila Prabhupada would go, not only would he lecture, not only would he take care of managerial affairs, not only would he take personal care of the devotees, but he was also translating Srimad Bhagavatam and Caitanya Caritamrta. \nPrabhupada gave us many quotes, and I wanted to read one of them. He said in 1971:\n\u201cRegarding printing our books and literatures, I may inform you in this connection that I saw one bulletin of \"Indian Railways'' in which it was specifically advised that every railway servant should see to it that the wheels of the carriages or vehicles must be moving always, which means that the railway is going nicely. Similarly all of us should see that our literatures are profusely distributed. That means that our missionary work is going on nicely. Otherwise we are simply sleeping and eating. The literature we have already designated as brihat mrdanga. So distribution of literature means great Sankirtana.\u201d [Letter to Karandhara, Nairobi, Oct.9,1971]\nSo, I remember that was one quote that oftentimes I would refer to, and it motivated me to understand the importance of book distribution. Of course, when I am speaking about book distribution, I am speaking about the distribution of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, because Prabhupada took great pain and spent so much energy translating these books and he wanted these books to be the basis of this movement for many generations to come. \nOne of my favorite references is Srila Prabhupada's concluding words in Caitanya Caritamrta. In it he has described how he feels that his spiritual master inspired him within the heart to produce these books. He quoted the verse:\ntene brahma h\u1e5bd\u0101 ya \u0101di-kavaye muhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25 [SB 1.1.1]\nThis is the first verse from Bhagavatam describing how Lord Brahma was inspired from within the heart by the Lord. And he said, \u201cSimilarly, I am feeling that my spiritual master is always here in my heart and he is guiding me in my translation, publication and distribution of these books.\u201d\nAnd then he thanked all of his followers for assisting him in fulfilling the desire of his spiritual master and Lord Caitanya. And he concluded by saying that, \u201cThe publication and distribution of books such as Srimad Bhagavatam and Sri Caitanya Caritamrta should be the foundation of our Krsna consciousness movement for future generations.\u201d\nSo, certainly, Srila Prabhupada emphasized the importance of his books for establishing the basis of this Krsna consciousness movement. And to continue to distribute his books for many generations to come is certainly the mission of those who call themselves his followers.\nSo, certainly one of the most important reasons for distributing Krsna conscious literature, Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, is to please our predecessor Acarya. \nThere was never a doubt in the mind of any follower of Srila Prabhupada during his manifest presence, that was distribution of his books was something that pleased him. He would say it again and again and again in his lectures, in his letters and in his books. So the devotees had a strong conviction that this was the way to please Srila Prabhupada, by distributing his books.\nAnd Srila Prabhupada also emphasized this as a method for spreading Krsna consciousness throughout the whole world. Prabhupada is pleased, and not only is he pleased but also other living entities who have forgotten their relationship with the Lord can ultimately become satisfied, by making contact with Srila Prabhupada in form of his books.\nSo, another reason why the distribution of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books is important is because it is meant for the ultimate enlightenment and welfare of whole human society. This was a method that Srila Prabhupada gave us for our own self-purification, and for our own progress and advancement in spiritual life \u2013 it was the process of distributing Krsna consciousness through distribution of Krsna\u2019s Holy Name and distribution of transcendental literature.\nThere is a verse in the tenth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, one verse which I personally find very inspiring, especially the way Srila Prabhupada translated it. \nI think it was in the prayers of the demigods, and the demigods are praying to the Lord, \n\u201cO Lord, who resembles the shining sun, You are always ready to fulfill the desires of Your devotees. And therefore You are known as a desire tree (vanca kalpataru). When Acaryas completely take shelter under the protection of Your lotus feet, and they cross the fierce ocean of material existence, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and because You are very merciful toward Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.\u201d [SB 10.2.31]\nPrabhupada translated this verse and gave his commentary. Also he spoke about the method by which the great Acaryas, and he spoke about Rupa Goswami and the previous Acaryas also, how they left behind transcendental literature for the enlightenment of mankind. So Prabhupada in this verse and in the prayers by the demigods speaks about how the Lord is very merciful to His devotee. He is always ready to fulfill whatever desires they have in their heart.\nSo when great Acaryas, such as Srila Prabhupada, take full shelter under Krsna's lotus feet and cross the ocean of material existence, then the Lord is very much inclined to fulfill and satisfy the desires of His devotee. He accepts the method by which they cross this ocean of material existence. In another words, He is very pleased by the method the devotee uses for transcending the material world. He gives complete shelter to that devotee who goes beyond the material world and takes full shelter under Krsna\u2019s lotus feet in the transcendental abode. And He accepts the method that devotee adopted for attaining that shelter, not only for the benefit of the Acarya, but for the benefit of everyone else who is left to follow his example and his instructions, so that those who are still on the other side of this material ocean, they can actually cross over this material ocean by this same method that the previous Acarya crossed.\nTherefore the Lord accepts that method for the benefit of His other devotees, those who are still here in this world. For our benefit, the Lord is so merciful that He actually accepts that method by which our previous Acarya went to spiritual world. \nIf we examine Srila Prabhupada\u2019s life and his final pastimes in this world, we see that obviously Prabhupada was very much absorbed in distributing Krsna consciousness for the welfare of humanity. What was Prabhupada doing on his bed, even just days before he departed? Devotees were holding the microphone to his lips and he was translating tenth Canto, thirteenth Chapter of Srimad Bhagavatam. Anyone who sees that picture, that clip in the film just days before Prabhupada\u2019s departure, it was clear what Prabhupada\u2019s was absorption and what his method for crossing this material ocean was.\nHe was always thinking of the welfare of human society, he was always thinking of how to inculcate Krsna consciousness within the hearts of his followers. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada himself established the importance of the distribution of transcendental literature by his own example. And because the Lord accepted Prabhupada\u2019s method of worship, the Lord Himself also certified this process as a way for transcending the material world. The Lord, Himself, also emphasized its importance. \nya idam paramam guhyam\nmad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati\n\u201cFor one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.\u201d [BG 18.68]\nna ca tasman manusyesu\nkascin me priya-krttamah\n\u201cFor there is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear.\u201d [BG 18.69]\nSo, Krsna has also certified that this is an important method \u2013 the publication and widespread distribution of transcendental literatures containing Srila Prabhupada's commentaries in which this supreme secret is explained. \nSo, we understand that just as the Lord, when He descends to this world, He has His external reasons for descending and He also has His internal reasons. In the same way we understand that Caitanya Caritamrta describes the Lord's external reasons for appearing as Lord Caitanya in this world was to distribute congregational chanting of the Holy Names of the Lord and to answer the call of Advaita Acarya to come and to deliver the fallen souls in this age. \nThe Lord also had an internal reason for appearing. He wanted to relish the taste of the devotional service rendered by His topmost devotee. \nSo, also there are reasons which make distribution of Krsna conscious literature very important, and that is because it is pleasing to Prabhupada and it is beneficial for human society. But we should also see internally, for ourselves, there also should be sense of importance for distributing Krsna conscious literature. It is important for us, because by pleasing Srila Prabhupada, by pleasing his followers and by pleasing the predecessor Acaryas, we also have a method by which we can please the Lord. And we also benefit. So, it is important for ourselves also that we take this process. \nAnyone who knows what it is like to go out and to stand on the streets and try to introduce Krsna conscious literatures into the hands of the non-devotees, knows that you develop a lot of important qualities by such activity. Certainly you learn the quality of tolerance. And although sometimes we may not feel so compassionate, certainly we can learn compassion.\nI used to have difficulty sometimes with that. We are supposed to feel compassion for the conditioned souls, and book distribution is one way to display that compassion. I always tried to connect that sense of compassion with my own feelings that I was experiencing while distributing books. And I would think, \"How is it possible that I could feel compassion when I am being treated this way?\" [Guru Maharaja laughs] \nSometimes I had to really suppress certain feelings and thoughts in my mind about what I would like to do to somebody, and I would have to remind myself that I'm supposed to feel compassion. But what always helped me under those trying circumstances is that by serving somebody who is compassionate, we can develop these feelings. That would always save me. That would keep me going. Because I sometimes saw this duality. I saw a difference between my own sense of compassion, and the compassion I could see that was so perfectly manifested in Srila Prabhupada. I would therefore have to take shelter in remembering that, \u201cYes. If I serve somebody who is compassionate, then maybe some day I can develop that quality.\u201d \nSo we can develop tolerance, we can develop compassion, and then we can actually experience satisfaction, real satisfaction of the self, because there is definitely a certain satisfaction that is there within the heart when the devotee of the Lord is pleased. And when you feel that confirmation within your heart that, \u201cActually, by this activity, I am pleasing my spiritual master, I am pleasing Srila Prabhupada\u201d - there is nothing more satisfying then that.\nEven despite so many external obstacles and difficulties and anxieties and pressures that one may experience, still even a moment of feeling satisfaction can immediately subdue all these other anxieties and distresses in the mind.\nWe can give a whole long list of qualities that one can develop by distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books.\nyasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana\nsarvair gunais tatra samasate surah\nPrabhupada would so many times quote this verse from the Bhagavatam. \n\u201cAll the good qualities of the demigods will automatically become manifest in someone who is engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Lord.\u201d [SB.5.18.12]\nSo, the distribution of Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books is also very important for our own purification and progressive advancement in spiritual life. And certainly purification is another important quality one feels by going out and distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books. It is very purifying activity, it cleans the heart of anarthas, unwanted desires. \nTherefore, we can understand the importance of distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books both for the benefit of others, for pleasing Prabhupada, and for the benefit of ourselves. As I explained in the very beginning before I spoke, you all have properly understood the importance of distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books, as demonstrated by your example.\nThe Hungarian devotees are distributing books not only in Hungary, but they are distributing in many other European countries. So I can understand that you have taken up this responsible work for distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books not only here and that you are not only being merciful to people here in Hungary, but you are being very merciful to the conditioned souls all over Europe.\nI remember once when we used to distribute books in 1970's, I was always traveling all over America distributing books. But sometimes, we would have to sneak into the different areas where there were temples and we would distribute books in their area. They were very protective, \u201cThis is our area.\u201d [Guru Maharaja laughs] \nAnd we always used to use the argument, \u201cYou mean there's not enough conditioned souls in your area???\u201d [Guru Maharaja and devotees laugh] \n\u201cWe are doing preaching for you. These people are going to get the books and they are going to look at the addresses in the book, and they are going see where the closest temple is, and they will come visit your temple. They are not going to come and visit us thousands of miles away.\u201d\nSo, we always just pressed on this point. \u201cYes, Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books are important to be distributed everywhere. It doesn\u2019t make any difference where they are being distributed. Everyone benefits. It is a win-win situation.\u201d\nSo, therefore, because you are taking up this missionary work of distributing books all over Europe, I can understand that you\u2019ve realized the great importance of giving Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books to as many conditioned souls as possible. By speaking about this and remembering this, it only gives me greater conviction and realization about the importance of distributing Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books. \nTherefore, I have simply come here today in the presence of all of you to take the dust from your feet and to place it on my head, and to thank you for taking up this very important service that is pleasing to Srila Prabhupada. \nAnd I would like to thank Sivarama Maharaja for inspiring all of you to do this very important service. Because I have no doubt that he is giving great pleasure to Srila Prabhupada, by seeing that this first and foremost desire of Srila Prabhupada is in the forefront of our preaching of Krsna consciousness. Thank you very much. Hare Krsna.\n[Sivarama Swami] Niranjana Swami Maharaja ki Jaya!\n[Devotees] Jaaaayyyy!!!\n","nid":"1042"},{

Maharaja will be giving both first and second initiations, and upon his request I shall speak about both. In doing so, I will simply be chewing the remnants that he has left. \nAs Maharaja mentioned, the holy name is Krsna Himself. As much as Krsna is a person, the holy name is also a person, and when we chant japa we are spending time with Him. Srila Prabhupada has explained the meaning of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra: \u201cO Lord, O energy of the Lord, O Krsna, O Radha, please engage me in Your service.\u201d When we call someone\u2019s name, the person naturally will respond, \u201cYes, what do you want?\u201d As devotees, we will not ask for anything material. We will ask for only one thing: devotional service. \nWe show our seriousness about developing our relationship with Krsna\u2014with the holy name\u2014by being attentive when we are with Him, chanting. In any relationship, if we want the relationship to develop, we have to spend time with the person. Here, we want to develop our relationship with Radha and Krsna, so we have to spend time with Them. And when we are with Them, we must be very attentive.\nEven in ordinary affairs, if a husband wants to keep good relations with his wife--or a wife with her husband--he must spend time with her (or she with him). Otherwise, she (or he) will complain, \u201cYou never spend time with me.\u201d And then, if one spends time with the other but is distracted--for instance, if he is sitting with her and she is talking to him but his mind is somewhere else--the other may feel hurt and complain, \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear one word I said.\u201d So, Krsna is a person, and we show our interest in Him by spending time with Him by chanting and hearing with our full attention.\nAt initiation ceremonies Srila Prabhupada would speak about ten offenses. To get the real benefit of chanting, we must avoid these ten offenses.\nThe first is sadhu-ninda, blaspheming devotees who have dedicated their lives for propagating the holy name of the Lord. The devotees who are preaching the glories of the holy name are serving the holy name. If we criticize a noble master\u2019s devoted servants, the master will feel offended. Srila Prabhupada gave the example that if you are walking barefoot on sand in the hot sun, you will feel the scorching heat on the soles of your feet more than on your head. Similarly, the Lord feels more pain when we offend His devotee, blaspheme His devotee, than when we offend Him directly.\nWhile the prohibition is on criticizing devotees, the positive approach is to glorify devotees, appreciate devotees, and serve devotees.\nThe second offense is to consider the names of demigods like Lord Siva or Lord Brahma to be equal to, or independent of, the name of Lord Visnu. Srila Prabhupada explains that sometimes atheistic people take it that any demigod is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, but that devotees know that no demigod, however great he may be, is independently as good as the Supreme Lord. Therefore, to think that chanting \u201cKali, Kali!\u201d or \u201cDurga, Durga!\u201d is the same as chanting Hare Krsna--to consider Krsna\u2019s inferiors to be equal to Him--is a great offense.\nThe third offense is guror avajna, to disobey the orders of the spiritual master. When you take your vows today, you are making a serious commitment. The guru instructs you how to chant the holy names and approach Krsna, and you must never disobey his instructions. He is very dear to the holy name.\nThe fourth offense is to blaspheme the Vedic literature or literature in pursuance of the Vedic version. His Holiness Niranjana Swami cited Sri Caitanya-caritamrta that to understand the glories of the holy name, one should hear the Vedic literatures from Vaisnavas. The Vedic literatures proclaim the glories of Lord Krsna and His holy name, so if we don\u2019t have faith in the Vedic scriptures or go so far as to criticize them, naturally the holy name, Krsna, will feel offended.\nThe fifth offense is to consider the glories of chanting Hare Krsna to be imagination. If a worthy person is being glorified\u2014if the glorification is justified\u2014and you object, \u201cOh, no. That\u2019s not true. He\u2019s actually not that good. He\u2019s not all that great\u201d\u2014it is an offense. Similarly, to place some interpretation on the holy name is offensive.\nThe seventh offense is to commit sin on the strength of chanting the holy name. If one has engaged in sinful activity before coming to Krsna consciousness, before one\u2019s initiation, and if one chants the holy name with sincere feeling, without committing offenses, one becomes freed from the reactions to his past sins. Scriptures say that if one chants the holy name only once, he can eradicate the reactions to more sins than he can commit. Srila Prabhupada comments that the holy name has such potency and that there is not the least bit of exaggeration in such statements. But he also adds that there is the question of the quality of the utterance. If one is trying to improve his position materially, he will not be able to chant with such sincere feeling, but one who is without material aspirations can chant with feeling and approach the Lord through the holy name. If one utters the holy name feeling helpless and dependent on the Lord, the holy name will quickly deliver him. \nNow, if we try to take advantage of the fact that we can become free from sinful reactions by chanting the holy name and then deliberately engage in sinful acts, thinking, \u201cI will neutralize the effects by chanting,\u201d that is an offense. If we have a relationship with a great and influential person and then act criminally in the expectation that he will protect us, we are misusing our relationship with him. As Bhurijana Prabhu writes in his book Japa, \u201cThat great man will shake his head and consider how to teach us some valuable lessons. He will change his attitude toward us and withdraw his protection (even as he continues to keep an affectionate eye on us).\u201d Anyone would feel offended by such errant behavior as described above, so why not Sri Nama Prabhu?\nThe eighth offense is to consider the chanting of Hare Krsna to be one of the auspicious ritualistic activities offered in the Vedas as fruitive activities (karma-kanda). Once, Srila Prabhupada was invited by Lilavati Munshi to a conference at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan on how the problems of the world could be solved through the Bhagavad-gita, and she invited the participating sadhus, or holy men, for a get-together before the program. One of the invitees said to Prabhupada, \u201cI gather people by the thousands and tell them that if they chant the holy names, they will become free from all sorts of diseases and maladies.\u201d He said, \u201cI am gathering people, and you are gathering people. I am getting people to chant the holy names, and you are getting people to chant the holy names. So we should cooperate.\u201d And Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cNo. What you are doing is against our principles. You want to engage the holy name in people\u2019s service, to fulfill their demands, but actually, we are servants of the holy name. We are meant to engage in Krsna\u2019s service, to execute His orders.\u201d \nThe ninth offense is to instruct a faithless person about the glories of the holy name. \nOnce, Srila Prabhupada was having a discussion with a learned man in Sweden, and in the midst of the conversation one of Prabhupada\u2019s disciples started to speak about the glories of the holy name. Srila Prabhupada interrupted him and said, \u201cThis is an offense. He doesn\u2019t yet have faith.\u201d In effect, Prabhupada said, \u201cIf you tell him about the glories of the holy name now, he may think that the glories are exaggerated or imaginary\u2014that the devotees are sentimental or deluded\u2014and thus become implicated in more offenses.\u201d\nIn the beginning, we speak on the basis of logic, reason, and argument, to bring people to develop faith in the Vedic authorities. Then, when they have faith, we can tell them what the authorities say about the holy name. Srila Prabhupada states, \u201cIt is an offense to preach the glories of the holy name among persons who have no intelligence or no faith in the subject matter. Such people should be given the chance to hear the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, but in the beginning they should not be instructed about the glories or the spiritual significance of the holy name. By constant hearing of the holy name, their hearts will be purified, and then they will be able to understand the transcendental position of the holy name.\u201d (Cc Adi 8.24 purport) \nThe tenth offense is to not have complete faith in the chanting of the holy names and to maintain material attachments, even after understanding so many instructions on this matter. We all begin with material attachments. It is not an offense to have material attachments (it is an anartha but not an offense), but if we hold onto a material attachment, that is an offense. To know about Krsna, about the holy name, and yet deliberately hold onto something other than Krsna, other than the holy name, that is not favorable to our relationship with Krsna, is offensive to Krsna. If we actually had faith in the holy name, we wouldn\u2019t hold onto our material attachments. If we had faith in Krsna, in the holy name, we would be convinced that all of our desires can and will be fulfilled by Krsna. \nOur needs and desires for physical security and maintenance, our needs and desires to love and to be loved\u2014all can be fulfilled by Krsna, and only Krsna. But if we don\u2019t have faith, we will think, \u201cOh, I need this to be happy. I need that to be happy.\u201d Or \u201cI need to do this to make money. I need to do that to protect myself.\u201d And we may become so preoccupied with our endeavors to fulfill our needs and desires that we forget Krsna, forget the holy name. We may stop chanting, or even if we do chant, our minds will be distracted, thinking of so many other things.\nThat brings us to another offense: pramada, \u201cinattention.\u201d Literally,\u201d pramada can mean \u201cmad.\u201d We are chanting the holy name of Krsna, calling Krsna, and if we ignore Him when He comes, it is a type of madness. It\u2019s as if I invite you to visit me and then when you come, I don\u2019t let you in the door. And then I invite you again, and again, and again, and still I don\u2019t let you in the door. It\u2019s a little crazy. We are calling Krsna\u2019s name, inviting Him to enter our consciousness, our hearts, but when He comes, we ignore Him. We leave Him standing in the cold, outside the door. \nSo we should take it seriously. When we chant the holy name, we are inviting Krsna, and we should treat the holy name with all the respect, all the reverence, all the care, all the attention, and all the devotion that we would show Krsna if He came personally. It is a very serious practice. But at the same time it is a very blissful activity if we really give ourselves to it. \nAnd this chanting is service to our spiritual master. We may want to distribute so many books, help so many people, do so many things for the spiritual master, but the one thing we vow to do is to chant at least sixteen rounds daily. That is our primary service to him.\nSrila Prabhupada had a very talented and qualified disciple named Kausalya dasi. She could cook, she could sing, she could worship the Deity, she could preach. And she had a very sweet and intimate relationship with Prabhupada. She arranged a program for him in Jaipur, and somehow, while riding on a rickshaw there, she had a mishap and broke a limb. She couldn\u2019t do her regular service, and she asked Srila Prabhupada, \u201cI can\u2019t preach, I can\u2019t cook, I can\u2019t worship the Deity--I can\u2019t do any of the things I used to do. What service can I do?\u201d Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cYou can chant the holy name.\u201d \u201cBut I want to do some service.\u201d And Srila Prabhupada replied, \u201cChanting Hare Krsna is the best service.\u201d\nSo, this is our service to our spiritual master. Once, a disciple said to His Holiness Radhanath Swami, \u201cSometimes I am so enthusiastic about service that even while chanting I am thinking of service.\u201d Radhanath Swami replied, \u201cIt is better to think of service than of sense gratification, no doubt. But when you do service, you should be thinking of service. When you do chanting, you should be thinking of chanting. You should understand that our service during the chanting of the holy name is to completely engross our mind in the sound of the holy name. That is our service at that time. During the chanting of japa and the chanting of kirtana, it is not our service to be thinking of other things. By thinking of service while you are chanting, you are actually not doing your service properly. Your service at that time is simply to be immersed in hari-nama. If your mind goes away, thinking, \u2018I\u2019ll do this, I\u2019ll do that,\u2019 bring it back to the holy name. Don\u2019t let it wander. You have the rest of the day to think of service, but at this time bring it back to the holy name.\u201d\nNow, a few words about second initiation. The Bhagavad-gita (14.26) says:\nmam ca yo \u2019vyabhicarena\nbhakti-yogena sevate\nsa gunan samatityaitan\nbrahma-bhuyaya kalpate\n\u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d \nTo serve the Supreme Brahman, we must be on the Brahman platform. We should be steady in chanting our minimum sixteen rounds and in following the four regulative principles. The second initiation is built upon the first initiation. When the spiritual master sees that the disciple is steady and approved by the temple authorities, he may award the disciple second initiation, which makes the candidate eligible to serve the Deity, the Supreme Brahman in Deity form. \u201cOnly one who is properly initiated, who is properly following the rules and regulations, can enter, and touch the Deity\u2014not all. And one who touches the body of the Deity, following such regulative principles, is immediately delivered from the contamination of material sins, and all of his desires become fulfilled without delay.\u201d (NOD Chapter 9) To touch the Deity, to render direct service to the Deity, is also a very sacred and blissful opportunity and responsibility. \nI congratulate all of you for being recipients of His Holiness Niranjana Swami\u2019s boundless mercy. You are very, very fortunate souls, and I am sure that you will take full and proper advantage of the good fortune that you have received and are about to receive.\nWhen I first walked into the hall on Friday night and Niranjana Swami was leading such beautiful kirtana and so many devotees were dancing, I looked at the deity of Srila Prabhupada and felt he was saying, \u201cI am very pleased with Niranjana Swami.\u201d I kept looking at the deity and felt that he said, \u201cYou do not know how pleased I am with Niranjana Swami.\u201d Then a few minutes later I looked again, just to see if it was in my imagination or if it was still the same. And again I felt that Srila Prabhupada was saying, \u201cI am very, very pleased with Niranjana Swami.\u201d \nYou have the most wonderful example of your own spiritual master, how he is constantly endeavoring to please his spiritual master and how his spiritual master is actually pleased with him. So if you endeavor in the same way to serve and please your spiritual master, His Holiness Niranjana Swami, Srila Prabhupada and Krsna will be pleased (yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado).\nThis is my humble request and appeal to all of you. And I know it is your intention anyway. Still, it is my desire that you give yourself fully, life and soul, to the service of Srila Prabhupada through His Holiness Niranjana Swami. If you do, your life will be completely successful, and we all will be together eternally, chanting and dancing and serving Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai and Sri Sri Radha-Krsna and Their associates. \nAll of this is contained in the sixteen words Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. \n\n","nid":"1033"},{

Glory to Lord Caitanya, who is dear to all the Vaisnavas!\nGlory, glory to the merciful king of Vaikuntha! O Lord, please place Your glance of mercy on the conditioned souls.\nIn this way the Supreme Personality of Godhead joyfully performed kirtana with the devotees.\nThe circle of Vaisnavas knew the foods Lord Caitanya liked since His childhood.\nWith great love they brought these foods for Him.\nWith great love they cooked these foods and invited the Lord to take His meal.\nOn the day the devotees invited Him, the Lord would come and very happily eat.\nThe Vaisnavas' wives were all amsa expansions of Goddess Laksmi. What were all the wonderful foods they cooked? I do not know.\nEvery mouth was always filled with Lord Krsna's holy names, and every eye was always flooded with tears.\nThe Vaisnavas in Navadvipa knew what were Lord Caitanya's favorite foods.\nWith great love they cooked these foods, and with great love Lord Caitanya ate them.\nOne day noble-hearted, lionlike Advaita Acarya said to Lord Caitanya, \"Today please accept Your meal at My home.\n\"Lord, with My own hand I will cook for You. Please accept a meal from My hand.\"\nLord Caitanya said, \"Anyone who eats the food You cook will attain Lord Krsna. He will attain pure devotion to Lord Krsna.\n\"Acarya, Your cooking is My very life. What You cook Lord Krsna eats.\n\"I am very inclined to accept a meal You have personally cooked.\"\nHow did Advaita Acarya float in bliss when He heard Lord Caitanya's words? I do not know.\nHappily returning home, Lord Advaita prepared Lord Caitanya's meal.\nAdvaita's devoted wife, who was an amsa expansion of Goddess Laksmi born in this world, happily helped cook. \nFrom West Bengal They had brought many of Lord Caitanya's favorite foods.\nWhen Lord Advaita sat down to cook, Lord Caitanya entered His heart.\nAdvaita's devoted wife was an expert cook. According to the desire in her heart, she cooked.\nThinking, \"Saka is the Lord's favorite\", she prepared many kinds of saka ten different ways.\nAdvaita Acarya cooked and His wife helped. They both floated in an ocean of bliss.\nAdvaita said, \"Please listen, O mother of Krsnadasa. I will tell you what is in My heart.\n\"Whatever I cook Lord Caitanya will accept.\n\"If He brings many sannyasi companions, then I will not be able to eat anything. This I know.\n\"The Lord will bring all His sannyasi friends to take this meal.\n\"The Lord will happily invite them to this meal.\"\nIn His heart Lord Advaita thought, \"Now I am cooking. Soon the Lord will come.\n\"Then I will offer food to the Lord. Then all My desires will be fulfilled.\"\nThinking in this way in His heart, Lord Advaita cooked.\nMeanwhile Lord Caitanya chanted His fixed number of holy names. Then in His heart He decided to perform His midday duties.\nAt midday all the sannyasis came to take their meal with the Lord.\nAt that moment, by Lord Advaita's will, the demigod Indra sent a sudden rainstorm.\nIn the four directions a hailstorm made a great tumult. There were impossible winds. The rains had no end. \nEvery direction was covered with blinding darkness. No one had the power to leave his house and walk on the streets.\nIn this way the great storm fell. No one had the power to stay peaceful. No one knew from where such a storm had come.\nBut where Advaita was cooking only very little rain fell.\nNone of the sannyasis came to take their meal with Lord Caitanya. No one could go anywhere.\nMeanwhile lionlike Lord Advaita finished cooking. He set out all the preparations of rice and vegetables.\nHe set out many preparations made with ghee, yogurt, milk, condensed milk, and butter. He set out pistakas, sandesas, kadalakas, and many kinds of sweets made with sugar.\nOver everything He placed Tulasi-manjaris. He sat down. In meditation He brought Lord Caitanya there.\nAs Advaita meditated in His heart, Lord Caitanya came.\nBy Lord Advaita's desire, Lord Caitanya in truth came there.\nChanting, \"Hare Krsna! Hare Krsna!\", Lord Caitanya lovingly came before Lord Advaita.\nWith great respect Advaita bowed down before Lord Caitanya's lotus feet. He offered a seat. Lord Caitanya sat.\nLord Caitanya had come alone, without any companions. Seeing this, Advaita became wild with joy.\nAccompanied by His wife, He happily served Lord Caitanya. He washed the Lord's feet. He anointed the Lord with sandal paste. He fanned Him.\nLord Caitanya sat down and happily ate. Advaita served Him.\nAdvaita happily placed many vegetable preparations before the Lord. Tasting the nectar of ecstatic love, Lord Caitanya accepted them.\nLord Caitanya ate the vegetables. Of each preparation He left a small part uneaten.\nSmiling, Advaita said to Lord Caitanya, \"Why did Your leave part of the vegetables uneaten? Please let Me know the reason.\n\"I see that You ate most of the vegetables. Only a small part of each preparation You did not eat.\"\nSmiling, Lord Caitanya said, \"Please listen, O Acarya. Where did You learn how to cook?\n\"I have never tasted saka like this. This cooking is all very wonderful.\"\nWhatever Advaita Acarya brought, Lord Caitanya ate everything. Lord Caitanya is a kalpa-vrksa tree that fulfills the devotees' desires.\nWhatever preparations made with yogurt, milk, ghee, and condensed milk Advaita brought, and whatever sandesa sweets He brought, Lord Caitanya accepted.\nIn this way Lord Caitanya, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ate. He fulfilled all the desires in the heart of lionlike Advaita Acarya.\nWhen Lord Caitanya had finished eating, Advaita Acarya recited Indra's prayers.\nHe said, \"Today I, Indra, know Your great powers. Today I know that You are without doubt a great Vaisnava.\n\"Today I shower flowers on You. I am Indra. Today You have purchased Me.\"\nThen Lord Caitanya said, \"Why did Indra speak these prayers to Me today? Please tell Me.\"\nAdvaita Acarya said, \"You please eat. Why must I listen to You?\"\nThen Lord Caitanya said, \"Why do You hide, O Acarya? That sudden rainstorm was all Your doing.\n\"It was not time for rain. It was so sudden. It was such a great rain. There was hail.\"\n\"By Your desire those calamities came. This I know directly.\n\"Therefore I say, when You say these prayers are 'by Indra', I know what You mean.\n\" 'If He brings many sannyasis, then I will not eat anything.' That thought was in Your heart.\n\"You thought, 'If the Lord comes alone and eats, then My desire will be fulfilled.'\n\"That is why You created all those calamities. Staying in their hearts, You forbade the sannyasis to come.\n\"What power has Indra to give commands to You? It is Indra's good fortune that he has a chance to serve You.\n\"He whose desire Lord Krsna never thwarts, He who has the power to make Lord Krsna directly manifest, He who always obeys Lord Krsna's command made this rainstorm. What is surprising about that?\n\"He whose command Yamaraja, Time, and Death place on their heads, He who he whose feet the kings of yoga and the kings of the sages yearn to attain, He the memory of whom frees everyone from material bondage made this rainstorm. What surprising about that?\n\"Who in this world of birth and death knows the truth about You? The person to whom You give Your mercy attains the fruit that is pure devotional service.\"\nThen Lord Advaita said, \"You love Your servants. With My body, mind, and words I hold You close to Me. I have that power.\n\"By the power of devotion to You, I have become a lion that lives forever. I ask this boon: 'Please never abandon Me'.\"\nWhen the meal was finished, the two Lords joyfully tasted the nectar of this kind of talk.\nEverything that Lord Advaita said with His graceful mouth was the truth. It was the truth. It was the truth. It was not otherwise.\nAnyone who is not happy to hear these talks is very lowly and degraded. Lord Advaita certainly remains invisible to him.\nAs they do not understand the talks of Lord Krsna and Lord Siva, so the materialist fools do not understand the talks of Lord Caitanya and Lord Advaita.\nAnyone who does not like one of these two Lords does not like both Lords.

"title":"Transcription of Initiation Lecture given in Kiev on January 10, 2010","ref":{"target_id":"1002"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Initiation"],"date":"Tue, 2010-01-19 07:16","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially edited transcription of the initiation lecture given in Kiev, January 10, 2010.\nYou can also download the file attached at the bottom of this page.\nSo today we're having both Harinama and second, or brahminical, initiation for devotees who are gathered here. We spoke a little bit about this yesterday from Srila Prabhupada's commentary to the verse of the Bhagavatam (SB 10.2.31). Prabhupada emphasized that one of the methods that Vaisnava acaryas utilize for crossing over the ocean of material existence and for helping others to cross is to follow and to recommend the following of the four regulative principles and chanting minimum of 16 rounds daily of Hare Krsna mahamantra daily.\nOf course there are many other things that Srila Prabhupada established as the foundational principles of this Krsna consciousness movement. But there's nothing more fundamental than chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. Prabhupada himself confirmed that the most important instruction given by the spiritual master is the instruction given to his disciples to chant the Holy Name of the Lord. One must aspire to chant the Holy Name of the Lord without offenses because when one comes to the stage of being able to chant without offenses then he is guaranteed to obtain love of Krsna. As Lord Caitanya Himself confirmed in Caitanya Caritamrita, \ntara madhye sarva-srestha nama-sankirtana\nniraparadhe nama laile paya prema-dhana\n\"Of the nine processes of devotional service, the most important is to always chant the holy name of the Lord. If one does so, avoiding the ten kinds of offenses, one very easily obtains the most valuable love of Godhead.\"(CC Antya 4.71)\nSo Srila Prabhupada established this as the foundational principle for the Krsna consciousness movement. Lord Caitanya, who is the original founding father of the Krsna consciousness movement, also established it.\nTherefore when we speak about accepting Vaisnava initiation into the sampradaya of the chanting of the Holy Name of the Lord, the foundation, or most important, is based upon chanting these Holy Names of the Lord. As is described in the Caitanya Caritamrita,\nkrsna-mantra haite habe samsara-mocana\nkrsna-nama haite pabe krsnera carana (Adi 7.73)\nThat the mantra, Krsna mantra, when chanting this mantra, the mantras that are given by the spiritual master, one can achieve freedom from material existence. But krsna name haite, the name of Krsna, actually brings one to the lotus feet of Krsna. Whatever other mantras we may chant which are also given to us, especially those who will be taking second initiation today, you will be given Gayatri mantras. But because Krsna's name is present in those mantras, therefore the mantras have potency. Without Krsna's name, there would be no potency. Therefore in every mantra we see Krsna's name is present.\nSo it is due to the presence of Krsna's name that the mantra becomes potent and ultimately it is Krsna's name which will bring us to the lotus feet of Krsna.\nSo chanting the Holy Name of the Lord is the means and the end. We chant Hare Krsna mantra in order to continue to chant Hare Krsna.\nnamaparadha-yuktanam\nnamany eva haranty agham\navisranti-prayuktani\ntany evartha-karani ca\nThe chanting of Hare Krsna is recommended for persons who commit offenses, because if they continue chanting they will gradually chant offenselessly. Even if in the beginning one chants the Hare Krsna mantra with offenses, one will become free from such offenses by chanting again and again.(Padma Purana)\nAs described, that even if one is chanting the Holy Name of the Lord with offenses, if he continues to chant the Holy Name of the Lord, trying to become free from offenses, he will gradually chant offenselessly.\nSo this is the method to become gradually free from offenses\u2014to continue to chant. Of course, there is a verse which also explains that if one chants the Holy Name of the Lord even for millions and if he commits offenses, he will never get love of Godhead which is the ultimate goal of this chanting. This is true. Even for millions of births if we don't actually come to that stage of chanting without offenses then we can never get love for Krsna. But if one goes on chanting with the understanding, that \"Yes, I still have some attachments from within my heart, I have some anarthas within my heart, but I'm always very, very careful to avoid these offenses to the Holy Name of the Lord. If one continues to chant in this mood then gradually he will become free from offenses.\nIn the Caitanya Bhagavata, Srila Vrndavana dasa Thakur explains in two very nice verses a very important point about chanting. We quoted these verses recently and we took note of these verses because they are very important verses which speak about offenses.\n\"A person who never blasphemes anyone, and who chants, 'Krsna! Krsna!', easily conquers Lord Caitanya, who is never conquered by anyone.\nAll the scriptures declare, 'A person who blasphemes others will not attain the Lord.' Srimad-Bhagavatam teaches that one should respect everyone.\" (CB Madhya-khanda, Chapter 10, Texts 313-314)\nThis is a very important instruction given by Srila Vrndavana dasa Thakur.\nSometimes we may think blasphemy can only be committed towards a devotee. But sometimes we differentiate between one devotee and another devotee, or one who doesn't fit into the category of somebody who shouldn't be blasphemed.\nWe usually think, \"Well if we blaspheme a very elevated devotee then obviously we are going to hell. But Vrndavana das Thakur says, \"One who never blasphemes anyone,\" \u2013not only the devotee, or the neophyte devotee, or the madhyama devotee. And also has respect for all living entities. This is declared in the Vedic scriptures as to be the proper attitude that one should have towards all living beings.\nIf we actually want to achieve Lord Caitanya's mercy then we have to be very careful about following these instructions as given in sastra and as presented by our previous acaryas. Therefore as Srila Bhaktisiddhanta would declare that the siddha-pranali for all Gaudiya Vaisnavas is the verse,\ntrnad api sunicena\ntaror iva sahisnuna\namanina manadena\nkirtaniyah sada harih\nOne who thinks himself lower than grass, who is more tolerant than a tree, and who does not expect personal honor but is always prepared to give respect to others, can very easily always chant the holy name of the Lord.(CC, Antya 6.239)\nSometimes we hear this reference, this term, siddhi pranali, as the means for achieving perfection by understanding our eternal relationship with Krsna and our actual spiritual identity and being given that spiritual identity. But Srila Bhaktisiddhanta explains that the siddha-pranali of Gaudiya Vaisnavas is trnad api sunicena, that one should always think himself to be lower than the blade of grass, to be more tolerant than the tree and ready to offer all respect to others. These qualities attract the attention of the Lord and will enable one to continue to chant the Holy Name of the Lord constantly.\nIf we give up chanting the Holy Name of the Lord, we should understand that it is only due to committing some offenses. We may find different reasons for losing our faith or find different excuses for not having faith in chanting. But actually anyone who has once received this Holy Name of the Lord in the proper disciplic succession and worships the Lord through this process of chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, must have firm faith and conviction in chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. That sraddha, that faith should be there even before accepting Vaisnava initiation.\nOf course someone may commit some offense, he may lose his taste for chanting, or he may give up chanting. And it may be due to some weakness of heart, hrdaya-daurbalyam. But if he's careful that he never offends Vaisnavas, he will never blame others for his misfortune, even though he may find it difficult, he may lose his attraction, he may lose his taste, or he cannot chant.\nSrila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains in Madhurya-Kadambini that actually such a person will suffer for some time, just like a person who has a high fever cannot eat. That's one of the symptoms of the high fever. You cannot eat anything. But anyone knows that when you have a high fever, you are very uncomfortable. It's painful. So gradually when the fever comes down, then one can begin eating a sick man's diet and take the proper medicine to bring the fever all the way down. Then when the fever is all the way down one can fully relish the taste and eat nice Krsna prasadam. Or, in other words, one can begin again in taking up chanting the Holy Name of the Lord, hearing the glories of the Lord in the association of the devotees of the Lord, and relishing it. But as long as the fever hasn't come all the way down, one has to take that which gives one the greatest strength and nourishment, which means that one has to find that which gives one the strength or nourishment for his spiritual life.\nJust like if a person is very sick in bed, he has a high fever, he cannot eat. He may told that there is some medicine that can help him. He doesn't think about eating rich, opulent food, or a feast. He thinks about medicine. \"What can actually cure me?\" And he will do whatever is necessary to take that medicine so that he can regain his strength.\nSo if a devotee remains humble, even though he may lose his taste and give up chanting Hare Krsna due to some weakness of heart, if he doesn't blame others for his misfortune, if he is very careful and doesn't blaspheme any living entity, then in due course of time, he will come back, he will achieve his position again.\nTherefore even if we sometimes see that a devotee is weak, we should be very careful. We should not criticize him. If he is not criticizing, why should we criticize? If we are not careful, we can lose our taste. \nSo we always have to be careful to protect our devotional creeper so that we can go on chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. Because it is by chanting this Holy Name of the Lord that one will be able to achieve the lotus feet of Krsna.\nSo sraddha means to have firm faith that simply by chanting the Holy Name of the Lord, all one's subsidiary activities can be fulfilled automatically. Chanting is the foundation of our spiritual life.\nJust like every day when we wake up in the morning, the first thing that we think of, when we are hungry, is to get some food to eat. There's food for the body and there's food for the soul. Every living being needs to be spiritually nourished by chanting the Holy Name of the Lord and by endeavoring to chant without offenses. Those fortunate living beings who have understood the importance of chanting Hare Krsna\u2026 This is also a very important point\u2014 \"to understand the importance of chanting Hare Krsna.\"\nIf we are not careful, if we become a little familiar and we begin to neglect the chanting, thinking that it is something that we do in our spare time, it will not be so effective. If we think, \"Chanting is the subsidiary activity and the most important activities are those which will fulfill my economic security and safety. No. Chanting is not subsidiary to anything. Chanting Hare Krsna is the very foundation of our life.\nIf we are not careful, if we neglect chanting, then we have to expect that there will be some consequence. We may be able to continue for some time. But in due course of time, the cumulative effect of that neglect of the Holy Name of the Lord will manifest itself. So we should always be careful to understand the primary importance of chanting. \nTherefore anyone who understands it's importance\u2026 Just like the same expression was used when Lord Krsna gave His benediction to Narada Muni in Brhad-Bhagavatamrita. When He gave His final benediction to Narada Muni, He says that, \"Anyone who hears the descriptions of these pastimes of the devotees in Vrndavana, and who understands their importance, will certainly achieve the lotus feet of the Lord in pure devotional service.\"\nThe same principle is there because Krsna and His name are nondifferent. Everything is manifest in Krsna's name\u2014 His form, His pastimes, His qualities, they are all manifest in Krsna's name. So anyone who understands the importance of Krsna's name,\nnama cintamanih krsnas\ncaitanya-rasa-vigrahah\npurnah suddho nitya-mukto\n'bhinnatvan nama-naminoh(Padma Purana)\nWe oftentimes quote this verse. How Krsna and His name are nondifferent. It is never a material name under any circumstance. It is no less powerful than Krsna Himself. It never comes under the influence of the material nature. It fulfills all spiritual benedictions. Everything we need for advancing in spiritual life is contained within Krsna's name. Therefore for those devotees who are taking your initiation today into Harinama initiation, you should understand the importance of Krsna's name. \nPlease also understand that we are not asking you when you come to give the four regulative principles and to accept your vows for chanting, if you remember what these things are. We are asking, \"What vows are you taking?\" Not, \"Do you remember what the four regulative principles are?\" Or, \"Do you remember what you are supposed to say when you come up to get your beads?\" We are not testing your memory. You are making vows. How can you make a vow if you don't even know what you are saying, if you don't realize the importance of the vow that you are making, in the presence of the Vaisnavas, in the presence of spiritual master, in the presence of Srila Prabhupada, in the presence of the Deities, and in the presence of the sacrificial fire.\nTherefore please understand their importance, and you 'll be able to further understand it's importance by hearing the glories of the Holy Name from the mouths of Vaisnavas. As described in Caitanya Caritamrita, \n\"One has to learn about the beauty and transcendental position of the holy name of the Lord by hearing the revealed scriptures from the mouths of devotees. Nowhere else can we hear of the sweetness of the Lord's holy name.(CC Antya 1.101)\nThis is the method for attaining the sweetness in chanting the Holy Name of the Lord.\nSo my very dear godbrother, His Holiness Giriraja Maharaja has told me that he would like to speak about the Holy Name today. Anything I have said about the Holy Name of the Lord will simply be like holding a candle to the sun. Giriraja Maharaja conducts japa retreats in America\u2014all over America. And devotees from all over the country gather to hear from him about chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. Therefore we will ask, because he has already assured me that he will speak, to give his realizations about the importance of chanting Hare Krsna. Thank you. Hare Krsna. \n","nid":"1021"},{

I read a lot from this book, I like different references that are given here. They are very philosophical and I see how Prabhupada was speaking so much about these points.\nOf course, someone may say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just read from Prabhupada\u2019s book? Because these points are there in Prabhupada\u2019s books\u201d\nBut this book was made available, and I\u2019ve been reading a lot from it and these quotes are very condensed and very potent. Some of them are very cutting, very sharp and very hard to swallow.\n[Guru Maharaja talks to devotee] Swallow is a little bit more graphic. [Guru Maharaja and devotees laugh]\nBecause everything from beginning to end is always emphasis on pure devotional service. And in the same way that Srila Prabhupada preached always about pure devotional service, he was very cutting and he would cut away at the false ego of people he was speaking to. Of course, Prabhupada would do it in such a way that materialists would simply laugh at themselves. But he would always leave them feeling as if Prabhupada was kind to them.\nAlthough, in certain times and certain cases, people were very disturbed by Prabhupada\u2019s strong preaching. But for the most part whenever Prabhupada would speak to materialists, they would always appreciate his qualities, his character and his devotion.\nOne of the qualities of a devotee is that he is kind. So he would speak in a cutting way that was also kind, so that when people received Prabhupada\u2019s cutting messages, they would still appreciate how Prabhupada was kind to them. And Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura preached also in a very strong, very cutting way and it would certainly polarize people\u2014 who could surrender and who could not surrender. Or who wants to surrender, but still sees that they have a long way to go. And who\u2019s disturbed by hearing the necessity of surrender, who may have become a little complacent at their level of advancement in Krsna consciousness, and doesn\u2019t want to really be pushed. There is expression in English, \u201cDon\u2019t rock the boat.\u201d I am comfortable where I am in right now. \"When I hear this it rocks the boat and I start feeling a little uncomfortable. And I don\u2019t want to be disturbed by having to think about having to surrender more at this particular point in my life, because it\u2019s taken me a lot to get to just be able to stabilize myself at this point. And the concept of more surrender is just too much for me to swallow right now.\"\nSo, often times we actually experience ourselves, or we may objectively observe this in other devotees. And I'm not speaking about it in a negative way, because everybody has to find their position from which they can move forward. One has to find some point of stability and security, because ultimately that\u2019s what everybody is looking for. Everybody wants to feel stable and secure, because it\u2019s our nature to be secure. Its our nature to feel and to be sheltered.\nAnd because it is our nature, everybody wants it, although some people may take shelter in temporary arrangements. Again and again, the Vaisnava Acaryas will always remind us that real, only shelter is in surrendering to the lotus feet of the Lord and devotional service to the Lord. The only real shelter is when the mind is just fixed on Krsna in the face of any kind of adversity.\nAnd therefore Krsna makes many different arrangements for the living entity\u2019s boat to be rocked - especially those who are sincere. [Guru Maharaja laughs] Because if one is actually genuinely sincere, it means that he wants to advance in devotional service and increase his dependence on the Lord. Because he has at least enough experience to know that by taking shelter in artificial temporary arrangements - there is no shelter there.\nActually, we were just discussing that point in the car on the way over here. We were speaking about a particular devotee - who was in the car at the time - who was revealing his own realizations about there is just no shelter in material arrangements. And he was revealing how material nature continuously battered him again and again and again and again. And the result of all that is that the devotee is still here to talk about it. And I was telling him, \u201cThat is your redeeming quality, that even though material nature smashes you again and again and again, you still know there is nothing else besides association with devotees and Krsna consciousness.\u201d\nThat kind of underlying conviction has to be there in the heart of everyone. And that underlying conviction comes from surrendering - even if it was just for a moment. Even a moment of surrender to Krsna can actually have a permanent impact on a living entity\u2019s eternal life.\nJust as that verse in the Bhagavatam says,\n\u2018What is the value of a prolonged life which is wasted, inexperienced by the years in this world? Better one moment of full consciousness, because that will enable him to search after his ultimate interest.\u201d [Srimad Bhagavatam 2.1.12]\nEven one moment of surrender has a permanent result. That is the power of devotional service. Like it says in Ramayana, when devotee says to Krsna, \u201cFrom this day on I am Yours\u201d, and Krsna releases that devotee from the clutches of the material energy and accepts that devotee. That feeling, even for a moment, that \u201cnobody else, nothing else, I just want to give my life to Krsna\u201d will make a permanent imprint on his consciousness.\nSo even if the next moment is forgetfulness of Krsna, even if he goes on and just forgets that he actually felt that way - at some point he will come back and he will remember the sweet taste of that total abandonment and total surrender to Krsna. It is actually very sweet taste. It is the most wonderful position to be in. There is no safer position to be in.\nBut still we fight and we resist. Sometimes we look for different ways to adjust the situation, so that \u201cI can be happy, comfortable, stable, secure.\u201d But still, deep down in the consciousness, we know that Krsna, at some point, is going to expect more surrender.\nSo, a Vaisnava who introduces this conception of surrender, sometimes he may do it in a cutting way and a person may not even realize how much mercy he has received. But there will be some point in time, by the mercy of that Vaisnava that he didn\u2019t compromise presenting Krsna\u2019s teachings, there will be some point in time when that living entity will remember that exposure to Krsna. That is the value of presenting pure devotional service. And we see that our previous Acaryas would not compromise in presenting anything other then \u201csurrender to the Lord\u201d.\nSo, I find when I am reading a lot of these different quotes from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta that definitely his quotes are in that mood of just presenting everything very clearly. I was reading one quote this afternoon about independence. The question is, \u201cwhat is actual independence?\u201d Everybody really likes to be independent. It\u2019s one of the characteristics of being in the material world is that we like our independence. We don\u2019t want anybody telling us what to do. We don\u2019t want to become completely dependent upon anybody, because to become completely dependent upon somebody in the material world is a sign of misfortune. As soon as you become completely dependent upon somebody then you are obliged, you have to do so many things - things that you don\u2019t want to do, but you feel like you have to do because, \"I am dependent on that person.\"\nAnd then we always try to make some kind of separate arrangements so that we can gradually release ourselves from the clutches of that dependence. But when we try to release ourselves from the clutches of that dependence, than we have to become dependent on somebody else. But we don\u2019t realize it. Or we may think, \u201cAt least this is a better type of dependence. It was better than the previous one.\u201d\nAnd actually that is what Srila Bhaktisiddhanta talks about here in this quote. He is describing what is actual independence. The quote begins with the statement,\n\u201cTo try to become God is non-devotional. The desire to become independent in this world means to become the servant of others. Material independence is simply a covered form of dependence. Complete independence is obtained by becoming dependent on the Lord, who is full of eternality, knowledge and bliss, and desiring only to serve Him. As long as the living entities hold the rope of the Lord\u2019s mercy they are known as His servants. Those who think themselves self-dependent, or independent, should know that they are actually dependent on others. Only those who depend on the Supreme Lord are truly independent. When we attain actual independence than the conception that we are eternally dependent on Sri Hari becomes prominent. Any object that is a complete whole is transcendental.\u201d\nThis is an important point to explain.\n\u201cService to, or dependence on that transcendental, absolute truth Sri Hari is actual joyful independence. Otherwise, the show of independence, while identifying oneself as the doer or master, brings only distress. It is nothing but subordination under maya.\u201d\nHere is a little explanation about dependence and independence. The desire to become independent in this world means to become a servant of someone else. The only real independence the living entity has is only when he is fully dependent on the Lord. If he is not fully dependent upon the Lord, then he can never really be independent.\nHe has to be dependent upon something and why? And the reason why is because, although the living entity is complete, his completeness is only complete when he is connected to the Lord. And if there is no connection to the Lord, he is always incomplete.\nThis is the actual state of every conditioned soul. There are no exceptions. As long as we are conditioned, we have material body and we have not established our eternal connection with the Lord, we are incomplete. And because we are incomplete we are always looking for something to compensate that incompleteness. Only those who are self-satisfied are complete.\nHow can one be self-satisfied, unless he understands who he really is? If he doesn\u2019t understand who he really is\njivera 'svarupa' haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era 'nitya-dasa' [CC Madhya, 20.108-109]\nOne is eternal servant of Krsna. Then he understands who he is. But if he doesn\u2019t understand, if he doesn\u2019t act in that capacity, then he cannot feel satisfied. He always feels incomplete. Therefore he tries to always look for something to compensate for his incompleteness.\nHe needs a relationship. That is one way to compensate for incompleteness - is we try to develop relationships with others. And of course, relationships with devotees is a way of actually compensating for that incompleteness. In fact, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta says that in following quote. He says,\n\u201cBy the devotees mercy the living entity\u2019s conditioned state, based on their independent will, is easily destroyed. Subordination to the devotees is the proper utilization of independence, and the desire for sense gratification is its misuse.\u201d\nThe proper use is to associate with devotees, and the improper use is sense gratification. And where does sense gratification always lead to?\n[Devotee] Disappointment. Misery.\n[Guru Maharaja} Misery. Yes. Distress. Always leads to\u2026 it\u2019s a law. You can\u2019t change it. [Guru Maharaja laughs] Some living entities think they can change it. Just like Srila Bhaktisiddhanta opens this little quotation with the statement, \u201cTo try to become God is non-devotional\u201d.\nThat\u2019s one way to try to change it - try to become God. Who is God? He is svarat, He is completely independent. That is one of the characteristics of the Supreme, He is independent. So if one wants to be completely independent from God, then he is trying to become God, because the only personality who is completely independent is the Supreme Being. He can do whatever He wants.\nOf course, we know that He is bound by His devotee. There are so many descriptions of the nature of spiritual world. And we see that probably the most outstanding feature of Krsna\u2019s pastimes in the spiritual world is how He is bound to His devotees.\nSo we may conclude, \u201cWell then, Krsna is not independent either. He is bound to His devotee.\u201d But that is Krsna\u2019s choice. He chooses to be bound by His devotees, because that\u2019s how He gets taste. That increases His pleasure. He likes to be bound by His devotees.\nOn one hand He is God and He is independent, and He doesn\u2019t have to be bound to anybody. But what it\u2019s like to always have to just be God? He likes it better when He doesn\u2019t have to be God. He enjoys it much more being Nanda\u2019s son, Yasoda\u2019s son. And being completely dependent upon them for chastisement and for nourishment. He likes to be dependent on His friends. He likes to be dependent upon how the gopis make Him dance and Radharani makes Him dance and do so many different things. When Radharani becomes angry, Krsna whimpers and comes back to Her and falls at Her feet and tries to hold on to Her feet.\nBut Krsna likes that. He likes to be dependent on His devotes. But He always has the choice. So He is actually ultimately independent, although He chooses to be dependent upon those who have pure devotion to Him.\nBut the living entities, they are not independent. They can never be independent. And when they try to be completely independent from Krsna, then they try to become God - which is non-devotional. Not only that, but they are completely in illusion, because they think they are independent. But they are simply the servant of others: to become servant of one person, another person and then try to get away from serving that person, serving another person.\n\u201cI need money, I have to work for this person. I need love and I am not getting it. I look for some person to give me love. And then after some time \"Wait a minute, this is not a love. This person is taking more than they are giving. I've had enough of this love. Let me find another love.\u201d We are not independent. We need love. We need to feel loved. We need to feel secure.\nIt\u2019s just the law. We are not independent! Accept it! But it\u2019s so difficult. That means, \u201cI have to surrender to Krsna. I don\u2019t want to be totally dependent on Krsna. If I am totally dependent on Krsna, then how am I going to have all my different arrangements taken care of? Krsna doesn\u2019t know anything about me? Krsna doesn\u2019t make any arrangements for me. He doesn\u2019t know I exist?! There are unlimited living entities! Who am I?! If I surrender to Krsna, I don\u2019t stand a chance! There are so many other living entities; there are so many other devotees. What\u2019s my chance?! How is Krsna ever going to take care of me? I can\u2019t just fully depend on Krsna. So I have to make some arrangements.\u201d\nTherefore, making arrangements means to become dependent on somebody else besides Krsna. Whereas Krsna says, \u201cIf you surrender to Me, don\u2019t worry\u201d. He gives His assurance. There are so many places in Bhagavatam. There are so many examples. When a devotee surrenders to Krsna, Krsna takes him under the protection of His internal potency.\nBut we are thinking, \u201cI certainly cannot possibly surrender completely to Krsna.\u201d So, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta says, \u201cOk, if you want to be independent from Krsna, you can be independent from Krsna, but you have to be dependent upon others.\u201d In another words, \u201cYou can try to be independent from Krsna, but you can never be independent\u201d.\nAnd therefore he says, \u201cAny object that is complete whole is transcendental. Only Krsna is complete.\u201d\nom purnam ada\u1e25 purnam idam\npurnat purnam udacyate\npurnasya purnam adaya\npurnam evavasisyate\n\u201cKrsna is perfect and complete. And anything that comes from Krsna is also perfect and complete. So many complete universes emanate from Krsna and He always remains the complete balance.\u201d (Sri Isopanisad, Invocation)\nSo, Krsna is complete. He is apta-kama, He is atmarama. He is self-satisfied. And He has no desires that He has to fulfill. But even though He is perfect and complete, He has unlimited living entities who are all His parts and parcels, who increase His pleasure by becoming subordinate to those who are fully surrendered to Him. And therefore although Krsna is perfect and complete, still He places Himself in dependent relationship on His devotees, to increase His pleasure.\nBut Krsna is not greedy, He is not only thinking about His own pleasure. He wants to share that pleasure. He wants everyone else to experience it also. He wants everyone to actually get the opportunity to experience what does it mean to be independent. And He says, \u201cYes, you can be independent, too! You can do whatever you want. And you can make Me dance according to your own will.\u201d Krsna dances according to the will of His pure devotees.\nJust like when Krsna wants something. Sometimes mother Yasoda would say to Krsna, \u201cOk, now Krsna. \u201d CLAP, CLAP [Guru Maharaja produces claps his hands]. She claps her hands. \u201cDance!\u201d And Krsna will dance. She can make Krsna dance. So many devotees can make Krsna dance.\nSo, Krsna wants to share that independence. He wants to give that opportunity to every living entity to experience what it's really like to be independent. He says, \u201cIf you want to be independent then just become dependent upon Me. And then you can be fully independent.\u201d [Guru Maharaja laughs]\nEverybody always has this conception that surrender\u2026 I like using this example. Surrender means waving the white flag. Waving white flag\u2026 when there is a war and when the army realizes they are loosing the battle and they see that everybody else, all their comrades, all of them have been killed and there is only small group left, and battle is as good as lost \u2013 so what do they do? They put out white flag. \u201cOk, we surrender.\u201d And then the opposition comes in, takes them, shackles them. Brings them under their authority. And they have to surrender to the opposition. Become slave to the enemy. \u201cNow, I have no more independence. I thought I was independent before\u201d. Or, \u201cI thought I wanted to be independent and therefore I was fighting for that independence from the enemy.\u201d\nJust see how much independence is natural inclination that people are ready to die to be independent, ready to lay down their lives in battle just to be independent, because it is natural to want to be independent.\nBut surrendering to Krsna is not like waving the white flag, because Krsna is not looking for any slaves. He is not looking for people to satisfy His greed, His lust. He doesn\u2019t need any of it. He\u2019s already God. Why would He possibly have to look to defeat somebody to satisfy His own greed? He is already the Supreme Being. He is the undisputed Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead. There is nobody equal to Him, there is nobody greater than Him.\nSo, why does He have to look for slaves? He is not looking to defeat the living entities in the material world to make them slaves. He wants to give them their taste of independence. \u201cYou can be independent. You can serve Me however you want to serve Me. And I will reciprocate!\u201d\nye yatha mam prapadyante\ntams tathaiva bhajamy aham\n\"As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Prtha.\" [Bhagavad-gita 4.11]\nAnd Krsna wants that surrender because He wants to give the living entity the opportunity to experience the same pleasure that He Himself experiences. He wants to share with everyone. And He even comes with the living entities who rebelled against Him in their heart, waiting them to turn to Him, so He can share with them.\nSo nobody can say, \u201cWell, what chances do I have?! How does Krsna know?\u201d We'll just use that as an excuse but actually Krsna is right there in our heart. And He knows everything. He knows more than we know. He is waiting for us to turn to Him to surrender. He comes with the living entity in the heart as a Supersoul, and He also manifests Himself in the form of devotees.\nAs Srila Bhaktisiddhanta said,\n\u201cBy devotees mercy, the living entity\u2019s conditioned state based on their independent will, is easily destroyed. Subordination to devotees is the proper utilization of independence.\u201d [Guru Maharaja repeats last quote]\nAnd even Krsna does it. Even Krsna shows Himself, how wonderful it is to be subordinate to His devotee. All His pastimes are all manifestations of this principle of how Krsna becomes subordinate to His devotees.\nWe read in Brhad-bhagavatamrta when Narada Muni is searching for the devotee who is the greatest recipient of Krsna\u2019s mercy. And he goes from one devotee to the next, to see who is actually the greatest recipient of Krsna\u2019s mercy. And then he finally comes to Uddhava. And then all of a sudden there is a discussion that takes place about who is the greater recipients of Krsna\u2019s mercy than even Udhava himself, but they don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nBut in Dvaraka, Baladeva and Rohini and so many others who were present there, they were all discussing about devotees who are greater recipients of mercy. And while they were having this discussion about Krsna\u2019s devotees in Vrndavana, who were suffering from great distress from separation of Krsna - while they were having that discussion - Krsna was in the other room. He wouldn\u2019t even get out of bed. He was lying in bed crying.\nAnd they were trying to figure out, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Krsna get up today?\u201d Krsna heard this discussion about the residents of Vrndavana and how they were blaming Krsna for causing them so much distress by putting them in so much suffering in separation \u2013 He came out crying. And He came out of His room and continued the discussion, and then He embraced Lord Balarama, because He was feeling so terrible that He had caused so much distress for these devotees in Vrndavana. And He lost consciousness.\nAnd He was just lying on the ground completely unconsciousness. And then everybody was so distressed, \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to Krsna? How can we possibly bring Him back to consciousness?\u201d\nAnd then Lord Brahma had an idea, \u201cI know, we can bring him to Nava-vrndavana.\u201d And Nava-vrndavana is that place that was constructed by Visvakarma, which was actually a replica of Vrndavana - where the devotees who are the greatest recipients of Krsna\u2019s mercy reside.\nBut Nava-Vrndavana is simply a replica. It looks just like Vrndavana. But one thing Visvakarma could not re-create is the residents of Vrndavana. So there are only static forms of mother Yasoda. Images. Mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja, all the cowherd boys and the gopis. They are all static forms, they didn\u2019t\u2019 move. They just stood there. And then Lord Brahma was thinking, \u201cYes, how we can bring Krsna back to consciousness?\u201d\nSo, he looked to Garuda. But Garuda was too disturbed; he was looking at Krsna and seeing and crying. Everybody was coming crying, looking at Krsna totally unconscious. Finally, he got Garuda\u2019s attention, and he instructed Garuda, \u201cLet\u2019s take Krsna and Balarama to Nava-vrndavana. We should carry them there on your back\u201d.\nSo, Krsna and Balarama were placed on the back of Garuda, and Garuda brought Them to Nava-vrndavana. And Balarama gradually awakened and He started to figure out what was happening. So, when They were brought to Nava-vrndavana, Balarama saw Krsna lying in that unconscious state. But this is Krsna from Dvaraka. So He had to make Krsna just look just Krsna in Vrndavana, He had to give Him all the ornaments of Krsna in Vrndavana: Krsna\u2019s flute, put on peacock feather on His head, dusted all the dust off His body, dressed Him as a cowherd boy, gunja berries, earrings on His ear. And then He said, \u201cWake up brother, wake up! Look. Look. Look where we are!\u201d\nKrsna looked around and immediately saw His father and His mother standing there. And He immediately bowed down and offered His obeisances, because that is first thing He does \u2013 goes to the feet of His mother and His father. But they were not moving. And Rohini also had come from Dvaraka. She knew what was happening. She knew that Krsna was going to wonder, \"Why isn\u2019t Yasoda actually moving?\" So, she told Krsna, \u201cYour mother is in so much anxiety because You wouldn\u2019t get out from bed this morning. She thinks You are sick. She cannot even move because of that anxiety. Why don\u2019t You simply go to the forest with Your friends?\u201d\nSo Krsna before going to the forest with His friends, He gave an indication that, \u201cMy mother Yasoda always give Me something to eat before I go to forest with My friends.\u201d So, Rohini realized that she immediately had to make some preparations for Krsna to take. And she said, \u201cYasoda can\u2019t do it because of her disturbed state. I will immediately go and get something for You.\u201d\nAnd therefore Krsna went further on the outskirts of Vrndavana and He saw some of the gopis forms that were standing there. Actually, before He left He took some butter that was in Yasoda\u2019s hands, because Visvakarma knew therefore that Krsna would go and take some butter before going out, so he put some butter in stagnant form of Yasoda. Krsna then took the butter and then He went.\nAnd then when he saw Radharani standing there. \u201cLook at Radharani! She must be angry at Me, She is not even moving! She must know what I was dreaming about last night, and She must be angry with me. She is not even moving. Look at Her stare.\u201d And He goes over to Radharani, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will come back later. I will see You.\u201d\nKrsna never even realized they were static forms. He looked to see if there was anyone looking. And saw there was nobody looking, and He gave Radharani a kiss and threw flower petals on Her.\nAnd all this time the residents of Dvaraka came to watch all of this. Satyabhama was there. Rukmini. They were standing behind the trees. They were watching, seeing Krsna completely controlled by His devotees. And Narada Muni was in the sky, he didn\u2019t even want to get close. He was thinking, \u201cI was the cause of all of this, because I started talking about who is the greatest recipient of Krsna\u2019s mercy.\u201d So, he was thinking he was responsible for putting Krsna in this state of consciousness. So he didn\u2019t even want to go close. He just simply sat in yoga position in the sky and watched from there. And Garuda stayed in the sky and spread his wings, so that the sun would not disturb Krsna. Wherever Krsna goes, Garuda would go.\nThen Krsna goes along with the cowherd boyfriends and with Balarama to the river Yamuna with all the cows and all the calves. And He goes to what He thinks is the river Yamuna but actually it is not river Yamuna, because it is Dvaraka. It\u2019s Nava-vrndavana. So when He comes to what He thinks is Yamuna River with the calves, He looks behind Him and He sees this huge city. And He says, \u201cWait a minute! Where am I? Who am I? [Guru Maharaja and devotees laugh]\nAnd then, because Krsna was just completely controlled by these devotees, and all the residents of Dvaraka were watching how Krsna was completely subordinate to the love of these devotees in Vrndavana: the gopis, the cowherd boys, mother Yasoda, Nanda Maharaja.\nWhen Krsna started asking this question, \"Who am I?\", Balarama had to remind Him, \u201cO, don\u2019t You remember, You came here to protect Your devotees. You have a mission to perform in this world, to protect Your devotees.\u201d And He reminded Krsna about His mission and how He had to go back to Dvaraka again to fulfill His mission towards His devotees in Dvaraka.\nBut meanwhile, all the devotees from Dvaraka were watching, seeing how Krsna was controlled by the love of these devotees in Vrndavana.\nAnd they returned to Dvaraka and then they were having a conversation. And Krsna began speaking in His own words about the love of His devotees in Vrndavana. He said, \u201cI would do anything for these devotees. They\u2019ve given up everything. They\u2019ve sacrificed everything for Me. And they\u2019ve completely given everything in sacrifice for Me.\u201d\nIn the Srimad Bhagavatam, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes in his commentary about the gopis. He says that Krsna says, \u201cI can\u2019t repay these gopis, because the gopis, they have given up everyone, they have given up their family members, they\u2019ve given up their mother, they\u2019ve given up their children. They\u2019ve given up everything for Me. But I can\u2019t give up My mother. I can\u2019t give up My father. I can't give up my brother. I can\u2019t repay them [the gopis]. I can\u2019t make the same sacrifice for them that they have made for Me! I can never repay them!\u201d\nSo, Krsna begins describing to all these devotees who actually are the greatest recipients of His mercy - the residents of Vrndavana. And by His own mouth, in His own words He explains that He can never give these devotees up. He is always thinking of them. He is always under their control.\nAnd anybody who actually knows this and understands this\u2026 And that\u2019s what Narada Muni asked for the blessing. Krsna brought Narada Muni into the room in Dvaraka and said, \u201cNarada, come in the room.\u201d Narada was afraid to come into the room, because he was thinking that he was the person who started this whole drama. And Krsna told Narada Muni, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that anybody who reminds Me of the devotees who are most dear to Me, is also most dear to Me?! You\u2019ve done the greatest service by reminding Me about those devotees who are most dear to Me. I want to give you a benediction. Ask for some benediction.\u201d\nNarada Muni asked Krsna for the benediction that the nature of His devotional service would be that the devotee never thinks he has enough of Krsna\u2019s mercy, and he never thinks he has enough love for Krsna, and he never thinks he is doing enough service for Krsna.\nKrsna said, \u201cNarada, why are you asking for a benediction like that? Don\u2019t you know that\u2019s the nature of devotional service? Look at all those devotees you went to. You went to king. You went to Indra. You went to Brahma. You went to Siva. You went to Prahlada. You went to Hanuman. You went to Udhava. You went to the Pandavas. You went to the residents of Dvaraka. And you saw that they all felt that they didn\u2019t have enough of Krsna\u2019s mercy. They all pointed to somebody who had more mercy than they did. They all thought they did not do enough service for Me. But they are all My pure devotees and I am reciprocating. That\u2019s already the nature of devotional service. That\u2019s how a devotee naturally thinks. Ask for some higher, some better benediction than that. Why ask for something that\u2019s already there?!\u201d\nAnd so Narada Muni asked for the benediction, \u201cI pray that anybody who hears these transcendental narrations of the love that You have for Your devotees, anyone who simply hears them giving them submissive oral reception and becomes attached to them, and is convinced of their importance, that they will be given the opportunity to engage in Your loving devotional service, the same devotional service that I\u2019ve seen these devotees have in Vrndavana.\u201d\nAnd the Lord said to Narada, \u201cNarada, I give you that benediction!\u201d And He gave benediction that anyone who hears these descriptions that they will actually achieve that same mercy as these devotees in Vrndavana have. Narada immediately went back to where he originally saw the brahmana who was doing puja. In Prayag. He went back to where all the sages were gathered and immediately began telling them all the glories of Krsna\u2019s unalloyed devotees in Vrndavana.\nAnd in essence what he was describing is how Krsna is totally subordinate to His devotees. Krsna gives them the greatest independence to serve Krsna however they like it. And Krsna reciprocates fully with however they want to serve Him - totally subordinate to them. It is the greatest independence. It is the only way you can do what you really want to do. If you try to become independent in this material world, it is simply an illusion. Try to do what you want to do in this material world and try to be independent from hearing about this \u2013 then you will just have to be dependent on somebody else. And it will only lead to distress. That realization has to be there.\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanta makes this point so clear. There is no independence, than full dependence on the Lord. And the Lord wants to give that experience to everyone. And all He asks, \u201cJust do something for Me. That is all, do it for Me. If you have to do some austerities - do it for Me. If you have to make some offering, make some sacrifice - do it for Me.\u201d \nThat\u2019s all He asks. He doesn\u2019t need it. He wants to share that experience. He doesn\u2019t need the offering. He doesn\u2019t need our service. He wants more than anything else to give us the taste of independence, the taste of devotional service to Him. He wants so much that others taste it, that He even wants to taste it Himself. Because He sees that, \u201cthe devotees seem to be experiencing more pleasure serving Me, than the pleasure I get from them serving Me.\u201d The Lord sees that in His devotees that they get more pleasure, so He wants to taste that, too.\nSo He decided to come as Lord Caitanya to taste it. That\u2019s how much nectar a devotee tastes in surrendering to the Lord, is that the Lord wants to become a devotee so He can taste it, too. So He became Lord Caitanya to taste it. That taste is the ultimate taste of devotional service, the last limit of bhakti. And as the Lord Caitanya, He came to distribute that taste. Not only to taste it Himself, but He is Krsna Himself who came as Krsna\u2019s devotee to distribute that taste.\nTherefore if we want that taste, we have to surrender to Lord Caitanya. There is no other way to get that taste - He has come to give us that taste. He is making that taste so easily accessible in Krsna\u2019s Name. That is the Lord\u2019s kindness, mercy and compassion upon the conditioned souls of this material world. And He is freely distributing it to everybody, even us. What did we do? What is our qualification? Therefore we can see how greatly merciful the devotees of the Lord are. How fortunate it is to become dependent upon the devotee of the Lord. The devotee is one who actually distributes Krsna\u2019s mercy.\nAnd therefore, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta says,\n\u201cAs long as the living entities hold the rope of the Lord\u2019s mercy, they are known as His servants. And His mercy comes by the mercy of His devotees. By the devotees mercy the living entity\u2019s conditioned state, based upon their independent will, is easily destroyed. Subordination to the devotees is the proper utilization of independence.\u201d [Guru Maharaja repeats previous quote]\nSo, we should all aspire that we can live this life in subordination to a devotee of the Lord, and give up the foolish idea that we can be independent in this material world. It will not happen. It cannot happen. And the only way to become free from that illusion is to take shelter of the mercy of the devotees. That is the greatest fortune. That is what the pure devotees of the Lord pray for birth after birth, to have association of Krsna\u2019s devotees. Because they know there is no other way that they can surrender to Krsna and get Krsna\u2019s mercy except by the mercy of a devotee.\nSo, I think I\u2019ve spoken long enough. I\u2019ll end here. Thank you very much.\n[Devotee] Hariboool!!!\n[Guru Maharaja ends lecture here]\n","nid":"979"},{
"title":"Transcription of Budapest Sunday Feast Lecture - November 22, 2009","ref":{"target_id":"1570"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Book Distribution","Marathon"],"date":"Sat, 2009-12-05 10:52","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"1","body":"This is a partially edited transcription of the Sunday Feast Lecture in Budapest, November 22, 2009.\nBefore I begin maybe I could ask, \"Is there anybody here for the first time? Yes, OK. Very good. It's good to know this so that I can try to present today's talk in a way that is understandable for everyone. I was requested to speak on this topic today, and I also spoke on this same topic last week in Kiev, Ukraine where I gave the Sunday Feast Lecture there. When I asked the same question there, a lot of hands went up, I thought there were about thirty, but later I found there were fifty-six people there for the first time. \nSo, anyways, because many people were present, I tried to present the topic in a way that could be understandable for everyone present, especially for the new people. In most circumstances, this topic, is more easily understandable by those who are practitioners of Krishna Consciousness, and especially those who are followers of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada because it is a topic which was very dear to our founder acarya of the Krishna Consciousness Movement. I am referring to the book distribution of his books.\nBefore I begin speaking on this subject, I would like to read just a little section from his Preface of \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is.\" And maybe speak a little bit about this reference, and then go on to speak a little bit about the main theme of today's talk, which will be this distribution of Srila Prabhupada's books, especially at this time of the year. \nThe name of this time of year has evolved over the years to be called the Prabhupada Marathon. When somebody hears it, especially for the first time, they may wonder what is the Prabhupada Marathon.\nHow many devotees here have participated in a Prabhupada Marathon? Could you please raise your hands? So there is a good number who know what I am talking about when I speak about the Prabhupada Marathon. I'll speak from it probably from a little different frame of reference because I was present during Srila Prabhupada's manifest presence, before he departed from this world in 1977. And because I had already been a member of the Krishna Consciousness Movement for five years prior to his departure, I personally witnessed his very strong, compelling desire to see that his books were distributed throughout the world. I felt pushed by simply hearing that desire. Although I felt pushed, when I look back on how I was pushed during those years, I have no feelings of regret whatsoever. In fact if anything it's helped me to more fully understand the personality of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Srila Prabhupada, his motivations, his purpose, and his purity. It also enabled me to experience a very sweet taste that comes from making personal sacrifices for the pleasure of a pure devotee of the Lord. It's a taste that's incomparable to any other pleasure that one may aspire for or experience in this world. But it's a mystery for those who do not understand the purpose of the teachings and the instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord. Why? Because by looking at it from an external perspective it looks like somebody is giving up their independence and making big sacrifices for no apparent remuneration. Also if one looks at it from that external point of view certainly they will not be able to understand the mystery of the teaching of the Lord's pure devotees. But internally, it can be understood only by one who actually takes up a mood of service with a desire to please Krishna's pure devotee.\nSo therefore I personally witnessed those years in the early 1970's. I was going out and distributing Srila Prabhupada's books on the streets to people, and was trying to introduce people to his teachings. People were looking at me sometimes amazed and bewildered as to why I was undergoing such austerities for no apparent remuneration. In fact I remember many times standing in sub-zero weather, sometimes even minus 20-30 degrees Fahrenheit in the middle of the winter. I'm from America. Therefore the temperature there is in Fahrenheit, not Centigrade. I don't know what that is in Centigrade, but it's cold. I remember standing outside and I specifically remember being questioned by the people I was trying to stop, \"How much you are getting paid for this?\" It was often the first thing that would come to their minds. Imagine, somebody is standing out in minus 30 degree weather, with cold winds blowing, and the only thing that he has in his mind is that he is trying to run to the car as quickly as possible to turn on the engine to get the heat on so, that he can warm up. And I'm standing there with a book in my hand trying to get him to stop and to hear something about a book. Naturally people may judge from an external perspective that this is crazy. But in their minds it's only not crazy if you are getting a lot of money for it. So they'll ask \"How much you are getting paid?\" And then I would tell them, \"I am not getting paid anything, this is strictly voluntary.\" And then the traditional response was, \"You must be crazy!\" People can't understand. It's a mystery. Because they cannot understand the kind of pleasure that one experiences internally within the heart from voluntarily accepting some sacrifice or austerity to please the Lord or the Lord's pure devotee. And that's what practically all followers of Srila Prabhupada experienced during his manifest lila. Especially in the 1970's. \nIt was 1972 when the first marathon for distributing Srila Prabhupada' s books began spontaneously. I was only visiting the temples at that time. I was not a resident or living in the asrama. But I moved into the temple very shortly thereafter. And therefore I was introduced in my first days of Krishna Consciousness to distributing Srila Prabhupada's literatures to people. And that for me at that particular stage in my spiritual development was something I found to be very difficult, but at the same time very important. The reason for this was that I was introduced to the Krishna Consciousness Movement and introduced to Srila Prabhupada by first receiving a copy of Bhagavad-gita As It Is. Sometimes people ask me, \"When is the first time you met Srila Prabhupada?\" And my answer is always, \"I first met Srila Prabhupada in the fall of 1972.\" That's because that was when I got my first copy of \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\", and that was really my first meeting with Srila Prabhupada. It was when I purchased \"Bhagavad-gita as It Is\" in a bookstore.\nPhysically, the first time I saw Srila Prabhupada was in 1975, in March, 1975. I was already his initiated disciple. And I saw him for the first time after taking both first and second initiation from him without seeing him physically. But my first meeting was when I read \"Bhagavad -gita As It Is\". I was living in Washington D.C. at that time. I was self-employed. I was a carpenter and used to remodel people's homes. I was twenty years old and I was very interested in Eastern philosophy. I had read many books that, at that particular time, were popular in the sixties and seventies. Books that may even be popular today, like the \"Autobiography of a Yogi\", by Paramahamsa Yogananda and \"Be here now\" by Baba Rama das. I don't know if they are still popular. But they were very popular in the sixties especially amongst the hippie generation. I had already been dabbling with Eastern philosophy in my teenage years having read many books independently from my studies in school and in the university. So having been exposed to different types of Eastern philosophy, I was very much interested in finding a philosophy which I felt was consistent with my aspirations in life, though, to be honest, at that time in my life, I didn't know what my aspirations really were. All I knew was that I was looking for something that was consistent with what I thought would make me happy. I also noticed that I was a very impressionable youth and that whatever philosophy book I read became my philosophy at the time until I read a different philosophy book. As soon as I read one book, then I was speaking about that philosophy and about that author and I would try to embrace his teachings. And then when I would read another book, I would embrace that philosopher, with his teachings, and then gradually I began experiencing some internal conflict when I saw that they were contradictions between these different philosophers and their conclusions. And that made it even more of a challenge, when I purchased \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\", because I already had a little skepticism in me. \"What is going to be my new philosophy, and what new contradictions am I going to confront now?\"\nSo, as I said, I was living in Washington D. C. I walked into a bookstore looking for a book on yoga, and I immediately went to the Eastern Philosophy and Yoga section. I picked up different books, looked through them, and then I saw Srila Prabhupada's Bhagavad-gita As It Is. It was printed by the Macmillan company in 1971. I immediately opened up to a picture of a yogi, sitting in meditation, and it showed the soul, going through the body, and leaving the body and exiting to a place unknown. So I thought this looks like a very interesting book on yoga, and therefore I purchased the book for the price listed on the back of the book. I later found out, many years later, that that book was never part of the inventory of the book store. I found out from one devotee, who actually put that book on the shelf in that bookstore, that he had placed Prabhupada's book there on the shelf. From time to time, he used to go into different bookstores and he just kind of dropped Prabhupada's books on the bookshelves and just leave it there. And I happened to be the person who picked up that one copy that was in that bookstore in Washington D.C. Of course the bookstore had no reservations to charge me for the cost of the book, because the price was printed on the back of the book. So I thought I bought the book from the bookstore, but actually that's how it was distributed to me.\nLater, in this connection, I remembered one quote from Srila Prabhupada. I can't remember in what year it was, but Prabhupada said that his books are like torpedoes, because you never know where they are going to land. So I realized that this definitely applied in my particular case that this devotee didn't know where these books were going to land. But somehow it landed with me and I began reading it. \nAs I said I was working at that time, I was remodeling homes. And I would come back from work in the evenings, and every night I would read a few pages from \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\". I continued doing it that way until I finished the book. After I finished reading the book, I was thinking, \"This book seems a little different than the other philosophy books I've read. The arguments seem to be very convincing and very practical. But they seem to require a level of commitment which I am not ready for yet.\" I thought that way because I would read in many different places in \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\", in Prabhupada's commentary, that Krishna was the Supreme Lord, and He wanted absolute surrender to Him. And I found that to be a little bit stifling, too restrictive in comparison to the way I was living. I was accustomed to an independent lifestyle, and therefore I said to myself, \"The philosophy in this book looks nice, but I think I'll put it away on the bookshelf and get back to it some other time.\"\nBut then, unconsciously, I found that my whole world view had been affected. Everywhere I looked, and everything I did, somehow these words that I had read in \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\" would resonate in my heart. I found that I just couldn't see things in the same way as I had previously seen them. At one point I was thinking that I should just forget everything that I read in that book completely. But it wouldn't let me go. It was a power beyond my control. And unknown to me at that time, it was Srila Prabhupada calling me. I gradually began to realize that when one reads something, or hears something spoken from the lips of a pure devotee of the Lord, if one is genuinely searching for the truth, then he will also get confirmation from within the heart that the words he is hearing are true. And when somebody gets confirmation within the heart about something which is absolutely true, it is very difficult to shed it, to give it up. As Krishna explains in the \"Bhagavad-gita\" that He is situated within everyone's heart. He is giving everyone remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness, and out of compassion for all living beings, He, who is dwelling within everyone's heart, destroys with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance. Therefore one of the manifestations of the Supreme Lord is as the Supersoul or the witness and the person who gives sanction for all of our desires and who is situated within the heart of every living being. When we hear the words of a devotee who represents the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that is why Srila Prabhupada, entitled his book \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\", because he always emphasized that his presentation of \"Bhagavad-gita\" and his commentary was to give Krishna's message of \"Bhagavad-gita\", the song of God, as it was intended by the speaker Himself, Lord Sri Krishna. In other words Krishna had a specific intention when He was speaking to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kuruksetra. His intention was to enlighten His devotee with transcendental knowledge and to help him realize his eternal position as that of an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord, whose constitutional position was simply to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord. Krsna was instructing Arjuna to give up his false sense of independence and proprietorship and to fully depend upon the Lord in all of his activities. There are so many verses in Bhagavad-gita, which emphasize Krishna's teachings to Arjuna, but these same words which were spoken by Krishna to Arjuna are sometimes interpreted by different commentators of the Bhagavad-gita to mean something different than what Krishna intended. \nTherefore Srila Prabhupada spoke so many times on this point. We heard it again and again and again of the need for presenting a version of Lord Krishna's teachings as it was intended by the Lord Himself. And therefore Srila Prabhupada's commentaries would always keep Krishna's purpose intact. If Srila Prabhupada himself were not a surrendered servant of Krishna, then his commentaries would have not had that potency. But we understand that because he was fully surrendered to the same teachings that were spoken by Sri Krishna Himself, his words had potency. And therefore they would act in such a way as to enter into the ear and then go into the heart. Once in the heart one would get confirmation within the heart from the Supreme Lord who is also manifested in everyone's heart as the Supersoul and witness of all of our desires. Srila Prabhupada would always emphasize that for advancement in spiritual life one requires assistance both from within and from without. Assistance from within from the Lord within the heart who is dictating to us according to our surrender, as Krishna says to Arjuna ye yatha mam prapadyante/tams tathaiva bhajamy aham. \"As they surrender unto me I award them accordingly. Everyone follows my path in all respects, O son of Pritha.\" So Krishna dictates from within the heart according to one's surrender to Him. In other words, when one hears the instructions of Krishna's devotee, he gets help externally from the devotee of the Lord, who is speaking the same message and has the same purpose as the Lord, who is dictating from within the heart.\nSrila Prabhupada would never say \"Surrender to me!\". He would always say \"Surrender to Krishna!\" Srila Prabhupada never demanded, at least I observed or experienced, although sometimes Prabhupada could appear very demanding and we will speak about that. But he never demanded, surrender to him without first emphasizing that surrender is ultimately meant for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord, Sri Krishna. And because he was so transparent in his presentation of Krishna Consciousness both within \"Bhagavad-gita\" and in his lectures to his disciples, an evolution of surrender would awaken within the heart of anyone who would hear from him, that following his words are as good as following Krishna's words, and that serving his desires are as good as serving Krishna's desires. They are non-different. Of course it requires faith. And I remember some of the challenges I used to experience in my early days, when I was first exposed to the teachings of \"Bhagavad-gita.\"\nOne of the questions I would always ask myself, and I remember very vividly these words, I would ask myself, \"How do I know, if he is pulling the wool over my eyes or not?\" Do you know this expression in English? Pulling the wool over one's eyes means, that someone is cheating me. He doesn't want me to see what's really going on, and he actually has a different agenda. We use that expression in English, pulling the wool over somebody's eyes means, when you want to cheat them and exploit them. And I remember always asking myself that question \"How do I know he is not pulling the wool over my eyes?\" And I could never really answer that question myself. I didn't know. But one thing I did know, is that everything seem logical. Everything seemed very compelling. And everything seemed to be a better proposal, than everything else that I was doing at that time. So it seemed Prabhupada had me. He was pulling me along by a string. He was one step ahead of me. And he was just kind of pulling, it was appealing and it was attractive. And it gave me a sense of purpose and hope, and it seemed to be better than what I had at that particular time.\nOf course someone may look at what I had at that particular time and say, \"Hey, it wasn't so bad.\" If I tell you what I had at that time, you would probably have a different impression of me. I didn't have a lot wealth, but practically speaking I had everything that one from my generation could possibly want. For somebody who grew up in the sixties generation, in the hippie culture in America, and I actually externally had the appearance of being somewhat of a hippie. I had very long hair down to the bottom of my back. And I was part of like a countercultural revolution, not wanting to really be the part of the system, but at the same time trapped by realizing I needed to make money. But if I was going to make money I was going to do it my own way. And that's why I described myself as being self-employed. I didn't want to work for anybody. I worked for myself and I would simply get work by going to different people's homes and I requesting them if they needed any renovation work in their homes. I had one quality at that particular time, that I was honest, and people could see that in me, that I was honest.\nIn fact one couple, whose home I was renovating in Washington D.C., they were professors at American University. They were both professors. Wealthy people, they had a beautiful home in downtown Washington, and they employed me to renovate their home. They gave me the keys to their car, they used to ask me to take their children to school, they gave me the keys to their house, they gave me access to anything I wanted in the whole house while they were away during the day. They didn't care, they just completely accepted that I was an honest person. And I would just spend my days there while both of them were at work, fixing their house. And they would become so thrilled by the work that I did, they would call all their friends and just tell them, \"We have this person, he is honest, and can fix your house.\" I never had any lack of work. I never had any lack of income. I had everything I needed. I had a guitar, I had a dog, I had a girlfriend, and my own car. I had everything, somebody in those years would aspire for. But I realized after reading Prabhupada's \"Bhagavad-gita\", that I didn't have everything. Because I realized that although by external vision I had anything I could possibly want, I still didn't have peace, and satisfaction. And Prabhupada would emphasize that point in \"Bhagavad-gita\", and many verses in \"Bhagavad-gita\" would speak about that point, about the necessity of peace. \nI especially remember reading that verse in the second chapter of the \"Bhagavad-gita\", when Krishna says, \"How can there be any happiness if there is no peace?\" That verse had a lot of influence on me as well as many other verses, and commentaries in \"Bhagavad-gita.\"\nSo obviously \"Bhagavad-gita\" meant a lot to me, because it was my first contact with Srila Prabhupada. And after I finished reading \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\", I sent a request to the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust to purchase more books by the same author. At that time the only books that were available were \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\", \"Krishna Book\", and First Canto, first volume of the \"Srimad Bhagavatam.\" None of the other Bhagavatams had been published yet at that time. So I purchased \"Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead\", and the first volume of \"Srimad Bhagavatam.\" I then began reading those books as well. So by the time I finished reading those books, I realized, \"I have to do something now.\"\nI'm telling you a little bit a about this, because I feel that if you talk to any devotee who joined the Krishna Consciousness Movement in those years, in the 1970s, they have very similar stories. In my particular case after I finished reading those three books, I decided, for the first time I was going to go and visit a Hare Krishna Temple. I had never really met devotees before.\nActually that's not true, I did meet devotees twice before. The first time I met a devotee was at registration at the university that I went to. I saw his book, and I threw it back at him. And that was my first meeting with devotees. And the second time I met devotees, I believe that it was in 1971. I was working in Boston, remodeling an office, in this building in downtown Boston. And I heard from outside the window, myself and my friend, we were both fixing up this office, we heard from outside the window some people going down the street with cymbals and chanting Hare Krishna. So we looked out the window, looked at them, and started shouting profanities at them. That was my second meeting with devotees. I'm being honest. Actually I think I met devotees one other time at Harvard Square, yes I actually did, it was in late 1971, early 1972. I saw devotees also chanting in the streets by Harvard University in Cambridge. And I just simply said to my friend, \"These people are crazy. Let's get to the other side of the street, so they don't stop us.\"\nSo the fourth time, I was visiting a temple. And that was after I had read \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\", \"Krishna Book\", and the First Volume of \"Srimad Bhagavatam\". I drove about seventy miles, which I guess is about a hundred kilometers. I was living in the southern part of Massachusetts in a house on the beach. I was still doing the same type of work, building houses at that time, and I decided at this particular time that I was going to visit the temple. So I drove about a hundred kilometers to the temple, I parked the car in front of the temple, and I looked for a long time at the front of the temple. I looked at the sign on the temple, \"International Society for Krishna Consciousness.\" I just sat there for about a half hour. I was thinking, \"If I go in there I may never come out.\" So I turned the engine on, and I drove back a hundred kilometers back to Cape Cod. True story. I'm not making anything up.\nA couple of weeks passed, and I said to myself that I really have to go to the temple. I was still reading, and everything that I was doing was just a part of that search. Everybody who knew me was asking, \"What happened to this person.\" I used to live with about maybe 15-20 people. We lived in a commune-like situation. We were all hippies. We lived close together to keep our expenses down. I was popular amongst my friends. And they would ask, \"What is happening to you? What are you reading in these books? What are you doing?\" They couldn't figure out what had changed in my personality. They thought I was undergoing some kind of identity crisis. But still I felt from reading Prabhupada's books, I felt very compelled. I had to go back to the temple again. \nOne little side issue, but it's related. As I said I used to live with a lot of people. And during those times there was no set standard of how people lived together. People would just live together and just you know, if you ate, you ate, if you cooked, you cooked, if you cleaned, you cleaned. But there was no kind of standard of how to live together. And I was reading Srila Prabhupada's books, about cooking for Krsna. We were all vegetarians. I had become a vegetarian long before I read Prabhupada's books. So we didn't have any problem on that particular point. But I used to think that whatever I cooked at least for myself, I wanted the kitchen to be clean, and I wanted to offer the food to Krishna. But every time I would go into the kitchen, nobody ever washed their own dishes. So before I could cook anything for Krishna, I would have to clean everything in the whole kitchen. And when fifteen people are living together, that's a lot of dishes. But I would just do it. But sometimes I would become very, very resentful, \"Why do I have to clean up after everybody, just to make a simple offering to Krishna?\" And I wouldn't say anything, but internally I was very frustrated.\nSo I went to the temple. This time I got up enough courage to go into the temple. I rang the bell, and a bright-faced devotee answered the door. He welcomed me in and asked, \"What is your name?\" I told him my name and I told him why I had come. He then immediately brought me to one of the senior devotees to speak to me, because he could see that I was a person who obviously had some contact with Srila Prabhupada's books. So we sat, spoke for some time and I was very, very impressed by his knowledge of the philosophy. He asked me if I was chanting Hare Krishna. I said, \"No\", and then he introduced me to chanting and gave me my first set of japa beads. I gladly took the beads and I began chanting on them according to the way that he taught me to chant. Then he asked me \"Would you like to do some devotional service?\" I said \"Yes, certainly.\" So then another devotee came to me and said, \"Come with me!\" He brought me into the back room, and there was this sink, with this huge stack of pots. Then he asked, \"Would you like to wash Krishna's pots?\" I was thinking, \"What is this? Is it a joke?\" But then I realized, \"No actually this is service.\" So I said \"Okay, I'll do it.\" It was the biggest stack of pots I had ever seen before. It made the stack of pots back in our commune look insignificant. So I started washing the pots and then the same devotee came over to me. Maybe he could see that I was a little frustrated. I didn't' expect this kind of service. So he looked at me with this big smile on his face, and he said, \"When you clean Krishna's pots, you clean your heart.\" And I just meditated on that. It was like a completely transformation of consciousness that immediately took place in my heart. It was such a simple statement, simple words, but my whole attitude completely changed 180 degrees. It became so blissful, so joyful, washing pots. I didn't think I could be so joyful washing pots. That was my first exposure to devotional service after reading Srila Prabhupada's books. \nSo of course, gradually I continued to visit the temple, got exposed to more service and many things happened. I decided to move into the temple. And devotees at that time, they were not just letting anybody move into the temple. They said \"If you want to live in the temple, then first you should live downstairs in the basement on the concrete floor for a couple of weeks. We want to see if you are sincere.\" That's what they said to do, so that's what I did. And I remember I was begging them to please allow me to shave my head. I really wanted to dedicate myself completely to Prabhupada's teachings and I felt shaving the head was a real indication of surrender especially for a long haired hippie like me. But they said, \"No, just wait till you are ready.\" I said \"I'm ready, I'm ready what are you waiting for? Please, shave my head.\" So finally after a couple of more weeks of persistent pleading with them, they agreed to shave my head. But in those days we had no electric buzzers. They just didn't exist. They cut my hair with scissors\u2014scissors and a razor blade. So the devotee shaved my head. I don't know how long it took, but it took a long time. Cutting it, cutting it, cutting it, cutting it. And then they had to use a razor on my head, and it literally looked like I had been through a battlefield. My head was just full of these scars, and was still bleeding a little. They used a septic pencil to get the bleeding to stop. Then with my head looking like that they said \"Okay, it's time to go out to distribute books.\"\nSo the very same day that my head was shaved, they gave me a bag, and we had these booklets called \"Reservoir of Pleasure.\" They were just little pamphlets. That's all there was in those days. We had that and \"Back to Godhead Magazine.\" Prabhupada's Gita and Bhagavatam weren't really available for mass distribution at that time. All we had was \"Reservoir of Pleasure\" and \"Back to Godhead Magazine.\" So they brought me out into the downtown streets and encouraged me to distribute books.\nSo that was my first exposure to distributing Srila Prabhupada\"s books. But as I said it meant a lot, because I was introduced to Krishna Consciousness through reading Prabhupada's books. In the early seventies the Krishna Consciousness Movement had a particular image in America. Prabhupada even said that as our movement began to expand, he said that first they will ridicule us and then they will persecute us and then they will accept us. This was sort of like the years when a lot of ridiculing was still there. But persecution had also started. And our movement had, somewhat of an image in America at that time of being a cult, though at that time many people didn't even know what a cult was. But it was during those years that definitely a lot of persecution was surfacing. But I had come to Krishna Consciousness because of reading Prabhupada's books, though many of the accusations that were being made against our society was that people were brainwashing us to join the Krishna Consciousness Movement. They were thinking that only a brainwashed person would stand on the streets in minus 20 - 30 degree weather selling books and not getting paid for it. But I always used to tell people, \"No, nobody brainwashed me, because I never even met a devotee before becoming convinced. The only contact I had was from reading books. First time I actually met and spoke with a devotee I had already read Prabhupada's books I was already committed to the philosophy. So how could I be accused of being brainwashed?\"\nPrabhupada used to emphasize that our books are our evidence. He said just like when you go into a court room then the lawyer will always present evidence from the previous decisions of higher courts. So he would make the same point regarding our books. He would say, \"Our presentation of the Krishna Consciousness Movement, our books are our evidence that this Krishna Consciousness Movement is not something which is newly manufactured. Here are the conclusions of the higher courts from thousands of years ago. We are not introducing anything new. It is thousands of years old, it is spoken by the original person Himself. So these books are our evidence that we are not a cult.\" And Prabhupada would emphasize this point again and again about the importance of his books for establishing a solid foundation for the Krishna Consciousness Movement.\nIn fact in 1976 there was a law suit against ISKCON, and it was a law suit that was being brought against the Society for brainwashing people. Actually I knew the person whose parents were bringing the suit against the movement. I distributed books with him. But his parents were bringing a suit against the movement and the court case was in New York City. It was becoming a very high profile case. We can read about it in Prabhupada Lilamrta. I also was in a court case though it was much later. And I was the\u2026 who is the person who is accused? I was GBC of the temple at that time. So I was brought into the court room also to defend ISKCON from a case which people were bringing ISKCON to court for brainwashing. But in this particular court case in 1976, Prabhupada specifically instructed the devotee who was representing ISKCON in the court room, to bring in all of our books and make the prosecutors read them. He said, this is our evidence in court that we are not brainwashing anybody. Prabhupada always spoke so much about the importance of his books and of publishing his books.\nI'll never forget, in 1975 when Prabhupada made the famous statement in Los Angeles, \"So, my spiritual master has told me that whenever you get money, you should print books. Therefore I am asking you, 'Where is book? Where is book? Where is book?'\" He says \"You should therefore print as many books in as many languages that exist throughout the whole world and distribute them everywhere. Then this Krishna Consciousness Movement will spread automatically.\" Prabhupada made that statement in 1975 in Los Angeles, where the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust was established. And he made the statement just the day after, the day after or the day before, I can't remember, when he requested his disciples to print seventeen volumes of Caitanya caritamrita in two months. Because that's what Srila Prabhupada would do. Sometimes he would push. We would feel that pushing , but he didn't really have to push. All he had to do was express his desire. Pushing actually came from within the hearts of his followers, because we were pushed by our desire to please him. We were all experiencing within our heart and getting confirmation within our heart again and again and again, that by doing something to please Srila Prabhupada was pleasing Krishna. And that's the essence of Krishna's message in \"Bhagavad-gita\". \"Everything you do, you should do it for Me. All that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities you perform, you should do it for Me. Abandon all varieties of religion and surrender to Me.\" Again and again and again we see this in Krishna's words in \"Bhagavad-gita\". And Krishna said, \"Try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master, inquire from him submissively, and render service to him.\"\nSo Prabhupada pushed simply by speaking about his desire. It wasn't like he was, although sometimes he would push, and I'll tell you this story, although I'm going to have to end soon. Sometimes he would push, but the devotees would feel such nectar from being pushed in this way. It was a taste that was incomparable. Because when Prabhupada would push a devotee, the devotee would be thinking, \"This is the opportunity to do something that is pleasing to Srila Prabhupada and ultimately to perfect my life by pleasing Krishna.\" Book distribution in the seventies was not something that was, you know, that was forced on everybody. It was not that we were thinking, \"We have to sell books in order to buy this or to buy that or to do this or do that.\" Maybe some people were thinking that way, but most of the devotees were going out and selling books and were just not thinking that way. At least I know I wasn't thinking that way. I was thinking that by going out and distributing his books, I'm doing something that Srila Prabhupada is repeating again and again, and again, that is pleasing to him.\nPrabhupada wasn't interested in becoming a famous author. He wasn't interested in becoming wealthy. He had no personal interest. Anything that came in from selling his books, he would immediately use it for spreading Krishna Consciousness. And he always proved again and again and again, that he would be self-satisfied in any condition of life. Whether he was staying in some fancy place, or whether he was staying in a hut, in the heat of the Mayapur sun, he was self-satisfied. He wasn't pushing to distribute his books for some personal gain. He was pushing his books because his spiritual master ordered him, from the very first day that he met him, to bring this Krishna Consciousness Movement to the West and to print books.\nJust before Prabhupada went to America he tried to take sannyasa from one of his Godbrothers. And he begged his Godbrother \"Please, give me sannyasa and sponsor me to bring Srila Prabhupada's, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada, Prabhupada's spiritual master, help me bring his message to the Western world.\" But this particular Godbrother said \"No, better you move into our Math and you take up some menial service here, and you do some service in the temple, better you help us publish Srila Bhaktisiddhanta's books, and these other books. We have no money for that and we can't sponsor that.\" But Prabhupada had an order from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta personally. And he would meditate and pray, and cry to fulfill that order.\nJust like the time when Prabhupada went to Santipura, to the house of Advaita Acarya, when he was still in India. He would go there, he would sit, and he would chant and the pujari would observe him sitting and crying and crying and crying. And the pujari went over to him, and because he didn't know who Prabhupada was. He was just some sannyasi who appeared in saffron cloth and who was sitting there chanting and crying. And he asked Prabhupada, \"What are you doing, who are you?\" And Prabhupada said, \"I'm an insignificant beggar.\" The pujari asked \"But why are you crying?\" \"Because my spiritual master has given me a very difficult mission. He has asked me to take the message of Krishna Consciousness and bring it to the Western world. So I've come to this place where Lord Caitanya, Lord Nityananda and Srivasa Thakura they would all come and perform sankirtana, and I've come here simply to pray to Lord Nityananda, and beg Them for Their mercy.\" And then he said \"I am also begging you - he was speaking to the pujari, \"Please, give me your blessings, give me your mercy, so I can perform this very difficult task.\" That was always Prabhupada's mood. He was serving the superior order given to him from his spiritual master. The next day Prabhupada boarded the Jaladuta and he went to the West. And of course we know the history, what happened from that point on. \nBut I simply bring up this point again to simply emphasize how important Srila Prabhupada considered the distribution of his books. Therefore all of us who joined the movement especially at that time, in the early 1970s, we were all nurtured with this purpose of pleasing Prabhupada by publishing and distributing his books. And Prabhupada pulled our heart strings by just saying these simple things.\nI remember one time, I was distributing books for many years, I was traveling in a van and doing traveling sankirtana, and Prabhupada was in Atlanta, he was speaking to group of devotees who were distributing his books, a lot of devotees from Radha Damodara traveling sankirtana party. And whenever Prabhupada would say something, immediately, whatever he would say, if it was something very important, it would spread throughout the whole world like wildfire, from temple to temple. Immediately devotees would get on the phone, \"Prabhupada said this, Prabhupada said that.\" There was no internet in those days. The only way we had of communicating with each other was just getting on the telephone. As soon as Prabhupada would say something noteworthy, the devotees would immediately get on the phone, and start calling all the temple presidents.\nSo Prabhupada made this statement, I believe it was in 1975. He said that the devotees who travel in vans, and distribute my books, they'll get my extra special mercy.\" And I was thinking \"Oh, my God! How is it possible? There is more mercy than what I am already getting? Prabhupada is ready to give extra special mercy. What could that possibly be?\" And all of us would sit and discuss, and we realized we didn't care what it was, all that we knew is that we wanted it. That's all we knew. And already we were distributing books twelve hours a day. We would go out nine o'clock in the morning, and stop at nine o'clock at night. And we would do that every day. And of course especially during the marathon. It used to be called the Christmas Marathon, because it kind of manifested spontaneously in December, 1972, this Christmas Marathon. Then when Prabhupada was placing more and more emphasis on his books, and the distribution of his books, the devotees in Los Angeles where the books were being published all spontaneously, without even talking to each other, decided to stay out late just to distribute Prabhupada's books. And one particular devotee who was managing the BBT, explained in the \"Prabhupada Lilamrta\", that he was staying out and it was already eleven o'clock at night. Nobody would stay out that late. Usually everyone would finish by nine. But it was Christmas time, and all the stores were open late. And all the shoppers were out very late. And he was thinking \"There are so many people, why don't I try to stay out late and give them a book?\" So he decided that he would stay out a little bit later. He was thinking, \"I'd like to stay out even later, but probably all the devotees are waiting for me back at the temple.\" It was the tradition that all the devotees would wait for the others to come back and they would all discuss amongst themselves how many books had been distributed that day. So he said to himself, \"I don't want to keep everybody waiting for me. So even though it's eleven o'clock and I am inclined to stay out later, I should probably go back so I don't keep everyone up.\" He went back to temple and he walked into the room where all of the book distributors would meet and nobody was there. He was thinking, \"Everybody went to sleep.\" So one devotee came into the room and he asked \"Where is everybody? Did everybody go to sleep?\" And the devotee said \"No, you are the first one back.\" \"The first one back? You mean everybody is still out? \"Nobody else has come back yet, I don't know why.\" So on that particular night everybody just spontaneously decided to stay out late. \"The devotees started coming back at around one-thirty in the morning. \nSo for the next few days up until Christmas, they all stayed out every night very late. The devotees there distributed something like 27 thousand books. They wrote a letter to Srila Prabhupada and told Srila Prabhupada how many books they had distributed. Prabhupada wrote back a letter, saying that he was very very pleased by disciples who worked so hard to distribute so many books, and who had personally undergone inconveniences for satisfying his spiritual master by distributing these books. He also said in that particular letter \"The devotees, who go out like this, and distribute my books, are guaranteed, they will go back to Godhead in this life.\" You can imagine what that quote did, and where that quote went. So that quote circulated throughout the whole world and then the following year, 1973, which is the year that I moved into the temple, I had my first exposure to the Christmas Marathon. The Christmas Marathon became the time when all the devotees would just simply optimize their time as much as it was possible, for spending as much time as possible out distributing Prabhupada's books. The idea was to sleep less, to do everything that we can possibly do for our basic necessities and in as little time as possible, to involve and to engage as many people as possible in assisting and distributing books, and to increase book distribution for Prabhupada's pleasure.\nWe would go out distributing from nine in the morning until nine at night. An on the weekends we would usually stay out until two o'clock in the morning. Wherever there was people, we would just find them and distribute books to them. And that's what the Marathon came to mean for all of us during the month of December. Actually, it began at the end of November, after Thanksgiving in America, up until Christmas day. Everybody would maximize their efforts and work together collectively to please Prabhupada by increasing the distribution of his books.\nSo I remember when Prabhupada made that quote that devotees who travel in vans, and distribute my books, get my extra special mercy. And we were all discussing amongst ourselves, \"What could it possibly mean, this extra special mercy?\" But we were driven, \"That extra special mercy, if we want to get it, we have to work even harder than we were already working.\" But there was such a pleasure, such a taste, such a satisfying feeling of lying down at night in total exhaustion, knowing that the next day was another opportunity for the same, and the next day was another opportunity for the same. And I know personally I used to be afraid, \"I don't want to lose this. I'm afraid that if I lose this, this desire, this satisfaction in my heart, then I'll have no purpose for life.\" I would be afraid to waste a single moment. Because I wanted that extra special mercy.\nPrabhupada would make statements like this, and we would be just catapulted to higher and higher levels of wanting to please him. That's what motivated the devotees. Ask any an devotee. Ask Sivarama Maharaja, he knows what it's like. I'm sure he has so many stories. He was out there at Chicago Airport distributing Prabhupada's books. We were all out there. Prabhupada one time said, to one devotee, he said, \"Leave one devotee in the temple to worship the Deities, and everybody else, out to distribute my books.\" He said that, I believe, to Sri Govinda das. I can't remember what year it was. It was a particular instruction he gave to one devotee, for a particular purpose, but those words were immediately around the world. And the temples were all emptying out. Completely emptying, everybody was out, distributing books. Prabhupada would make a statement, it would go around the world, and the devotees were just was simply motivated to do something to please him. And that's how the Prabhupada Marathon began. It began in that way, in a very spontaneous way and then it just became a tradition. \nAnd, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to go this long. But this is a very important point, so I wanted to add this one other point. Because it was 1977. November, 1977. Those who are devotees, you know what happened in November, 1977. But, just prior to this day in November, in 1977, Prabhupada was in Vrindavana, he was, as you know, he was very ill. And devotees were coming from all over the world, because it appeared that Prabhupada was going to leave this world. His body had became very emaciated because he hadn't eaten for months. He had given an indication that he wasn't going to stay much longer. Sometimes he would almost appear externally as if to say that, \"It's time for me to go.\" And for Krishna's pure devotee to leave this world and to leave this body, it means he's going to join Krishna in the spiritual world. There is no source of lamentation whatsoever for the devotee who departs and returns to Krishna's transcendental abode. But certainly for those who are dependent upon the association of that devotee, it is a great cause for lamentation.\nSo Prabhupada had given an indication one day that Krishna had given him his choice. That to stay, or to go. So the devotees who had all assembled in Vrindavana at that time, they decided that they would discuss this amongst themselves because although Prabhupada had indicated that he was inclined to go, he also indicated that Krishna gave him the choice to stay or to leave. So the devotees were afraid, \"If we ask Prabhupada to stay, are we being selfish? We shouldn't be selfish, We should let our spiritual master do whatever he wishes to do. If he wishes to leave and if he wishes to join Krishna in His eternal pastimes then are we being selfish by begging him to stay for us?\" So there was a very long discussion on this point, whether or not they should ask Prabhupada to stay or to let him go. Finally they decided that, \"No, Srila Prabhupada hasn't finished translating Srimad Bhagavatam yet. We should therefore ask Srila Prabhupada to stay so that he can finish writing Srimad Bhagavatam, which is his life's work.\"\nSo they made this decision and selected one person to be the spokesperson for the whole group. And they went in to Srila Prabhupada's room together in a group, and they pushed this devotee forward. They all were standing behind him, patting him on the shoulder, rubbing his back, encouraging him to go ahead, \"Say it, say it!\" Because he didn't know if he had the strength to say it. So they were trying to give him strength \"Go ahead, we are all behind you. Say it!\" And he broke down crying and all the devotees broke down crying, and he said to Srila Prabhupada \"Srila Prabhupada, If Krishna has given you the choice to stay, or to leave, then we are asking you, please, stay. We need you to finish the Srimad Bhagavatam, it is your life's work. We need you to guide us, we are fully dependent upon you. Therefore if Krishna has given you the choice, we ask, Please stay.\" And Prabhupada said \"Do you want me to stay?\" And by that time the devotees emotions was so overwhelmed, everyone was crying. But they felt that they all had to stay firm on their decision, and they said \"Yes, Prabhupada.\" And Prabhupada very casually said \"OK, I'll stay.\"\nAs soon as Prabhupada said that, ring, ring, ring, ring, all over the world, phones were ringing. \"Prabhupada said, he is going to stay!\" At that time I was in charge of a book distribution center. I was training all uninitiated devotees on how to distribute Srila Prabhupada's books. All of them were thinking that \"Prabhupada is our spiritual master, we are not initiated, how can Prabhupada leave?\" And they were all so absorbed in distributing Prabhupada's books. It wasn't very difficult to encourage them to go out and distribute Prabhupada's books. They were mad after distributing Prabhupada's books.\nSo the phones were ringing and everyone was told, Prabhupada said, he is going to stay.\" So we all just accepted. \"Prabhupada's going to stay\". At least for me it was \"That's it, Prabhupada is staying. I can go on with my service, I can go on encouraging these devotees.\" And for all the devotees who were not in Vrindavana, that was how we were thinking.\nThen, shortly afterwards I was driving with all of these devotees to another temple, I remember exactly where I was at the time. If you ask any disciple of Srila Prabhupada \"Where were you when you heard that Prabhupada departed from this world?\", I am confident, that every devotee will remember exactly where they were, what they were doing, and how they found out. \nI was driving, I had to stop and call the temple president to tell him that I was going to be a little bit late, and, as I said we were all thinking that Prabhupada was going to stay. I called the temple president to tell him that we are all coming to Boston, but we were going to be a little bit late for the program. As soon as I called, he told me, \"Prabhupada departed.\" You can imagine what it was like for the heart\u2014 the bewilderment, the pain, separation, and crying. I never cried like that in my life. It was just totally unexpected.\nFor whatever reason, Prabhupada decided to leave. But this was just two weeks before the month of December. We all knew, everyone knew throughout the whole world that if we wanted Prabhupada to be at the center of our movement again, there was only one way to bring him, and that was to distribute his books. That 1977 Marathon was the biggest marathon in the history of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The devotees realized that although Prabhupada left and it appeared we were like a ship without a rudder, still Prabhupada made it very clear, that if we wanted to please him, we should go on distributing his books. And therefore everyone got the strength, courage and enthusiasm. This time of the year has become a tradition for everybody to work collectively to bring Prabhupada, Prabhupada's desires back into focus. That same focus that everybody had during Prabhupada's manifest presence is also brought again, and again, and again and again, year after year after year.\nAnd as I said Prabhupada pushed simply by expressing his desire. I am not pushing. I am simply speaking as I experienced in Prabhupada's manifest presence. This is not my desire. I've simply been asked to speak about what I experienced during Prabhupada's physical presence. And these last two hours were my personal testimony of what I experienced and what everybody else in the Krishna Consciousness Movement experienced during Prabhupada's physical presence. We felt a very burning desire to fulfill Prabhupada's desire.\nTherefore for anyone who has not experienced a taste of what it's like to push and push, and push for Prabhupada, this Marathon is organized for your benefit. Take advantage. Don't let this lifetime pass, without at least once experiencing this taste in pushing for Prabhupada. Prabhupada is not a miserly person. That same taste that he gave to his direct followers is just as accessible for generations and generations to come. But, it's also a mystery. It can't be experienced unless that desire has been awakened within the heart to do something that really pleases Prabhupada.\nGranted we all have our services and we have a means for pleasing Krishna's devotee, and pleasing Prabhupada. But in this particular time of the year there is an emphasis for everyone to get the opportunity to do a little bit more. It's available for anyone who wants to take part. Nobody is going to push anyone. But all opportunities are there. If we actually feel the pushing from within, it's a great opportunity to become Prabhupada conscious and to really meditate on what is actually so dear to his heart. It's a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\", that nobody should miss out on. Don't let this lifetime pass without at least once experiencing what it's like to taste a Marathon for Srila Prabhupada's pleasure. I say that from my own direct realization and experience and from my heart. And I leave those words to all of you, and I invite you to please take advantage of Srila Prabhupada's mercy. Hare Krishna. Thank you very much. Srila Prabhupada ki jaya! I'm sorry I didn't read from the Bhagavad-gita As It Is. But I tried to capture the essence.\n","nid":"962"},{

Are there any new people here? Somebody who is here for the first time? Yes, OK. Thank you. It's good to know these things before speaking so I can present things in such a way that is understandable for the whole audience. We have a lot of devotees here who have come to visit from other cities, and this is also an opportunity to speak to them. It will be our last opportunity to speak to them, this visit. So I'd like to discuss a subject that I recently discussed elsewhere but we can also discuss it here. But first I'd like to read from one paragraph from the Preface of the Bhagavad-gita As It Is by Srila Prabhupada. So we will just read the last paragraph. \n\"People in general, especially in this Age of Kali, are enamored by the external energy of Krsna, and they wrongly think that by advancement of material comforts every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that the material or external nature is very strong, for everyone is strongly bound by the stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily the part and parcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service to the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him happy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy the senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants this, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of Bhagavad-gita. Our Krsna consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point, and because we are not polluting the theme of Bhagavad-gita As It Is, anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the Bhagavad-gita must take help from the Krsna consciousness movement for practical understanding of Bhagavad-gita under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying Bhagavad-gita As It Is as we have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our attempt a success.\" \nAs we said this was written by our founder Acarya, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. It is dated the 12th May, 1971. Of course, Srila Prabhupada had translated and given commentary to Bhagavad-gita prior to this. But this is when he had written the Preface for the new Bhagavad-gita which was reprinted. And by this time the Krishna consciousness movement had already been expanding throughout the world for almost six years. And Srila Prabhupada understood the importance of distributing this message of Bhagavad-gita throughout the world, and he stressed that importance to his followers.\nThe essence of the teachings of the Bhagavad-gita are nicely summarized here in this paragraph we just read. That the ultimate purpose of everyone in this world is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. That is the actual message of Bhagavad-gita, how to serve and satisfy the Supreme Lord by one's activities. Every living being constitutionally by nature has this innate desire to want to please somebody. This is the symptom of life. And it cannot be in any way eradicated from the essence of the living being.\nOf course under the spell of the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord, the living being may direct that endeavor to satisfy himself. But that is under the influence of the illusory energy to think that one can be satisfied separate from satisfying the Lord. Still the desire to satisfy someone is the intrinsic characteristic of the self. Prabhupada explains that that is the dharma of the living being. The dharma of the living being is his constitutional nature, that nature that cannot be removed under any circumstance. It is that God-given nature. And therefore he gives the example of dharma by equating it to material substances.\nFor instance he says the dharma of fire is heat and light, and the dharma of water is liquidity. If you take heat and light away from fire, then it's not fire. They are the very qualities of fire which make it recognizable as being fire. If you take liquidity away from water then it's not water. Similarly service is the dharma of the living being. And therefore every living being is by nature meant to render service. The root or the actual object of that service is none other than the Supreme Lord who is the original cause of this cosmic manifestation and who is the original source of all living beings. And the Bhagavad-gita gives this message throughout many verses of the Bhagavad-gita. The speaker of the Bhagavad-gita is Lord Krishna Himself. And the words spoken by Him are meant to dispel the influence of the illusory energy, so that the recipient of that knowledge can realize his constitutional nature as a servant.\nUnfortunately many people do not like to hear this, because they think that to be subservient to somebody means to be enslaved. They don't like to think, \"Oh I have to serve somebody else\", what to speak of when Lord Krishna states in Bhagavad-gita that 'You should give everything to Me. \"All that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you perform, you should perform for Me\", Krishna says in Bhagavad-gita. Somebody may hear that statement of Bhagavad-gita, and analyze and think that this is some type of self-serving God. He wants everything for Himself. So He must be very egotistic. I don't want to submit myself to such an egotistical being who wants everything for Himself. \nBut one makes such a statement due to one's lack of understanding of who is Krishna. And unfortunately most people do not have a proper understanding of who is Krishna. Why does Krishna makes such a statement? In fact Prabhupada even said here, we've just read here in the commentary, he said, he uses the word \"demands\". \"The Lord wants this and He demands it\". That also sounds like a very strong word to use, \"demands it \". \"Demand \" it means, \"yes, you have to do it\". But although He demands it, He gives the living being his freedom to choose. Because that freedom to choose is also God-given. Our constitutional nature is that we can choose to serve either Krishna, or we can serve Krishna's illusory energy. That's our choice. But that's the limit. There is no other choice, there are no other options. We may look for other options, but they just don't exist. Because also in Bhagavad-gita Krishna explains that He has these different energies, the spiritual energy and the material energy. etad- yonini bhutani/ sarvanity upadharaya, Of all that is material and all that is spiritual, you should know that I am both it's origin and it's dissolution.\nOf course there is no dissolution for the spiritual. The characteristic of that which is spiritual, is eternal, full of knowledge, and full of pleasure. And the characteristic of that which is material is that it's temporary, full of ignorance and it's filled with suffering. Asat acit nirananda. \nSo Krishna explains that these are His energies. He describes that there is the inferior energy, the superior energy, and the living entities, who though belong to the spiritual energy, the superior energy, they can come under the influence of the material energy. These are the three primary potencies of the Supreme Lord. Spiritual energy is full of knowledge, and the material energy is temporary and full of suffering, and the living entity, who is also described as Krishna's energies, that is described in Bhagavad-gita, mamivamso jiva loke /jiva bhutah sanatanah, He says that these are my separated parts and parcels, the living entities. They are also energies of the Supreme Lord. And therefore they also have some qualities of the Supreme Lord. But the quality they have of the Supreme Lord, is minute in quantity. Whereas the Supreme Lord has these qualities unlimitedly, the living entity has them in minute quantity.\nThe Supreme Lord is unlimitedly independent. He is always independent, He can do whatever He wishes. Therefore the living entities being part and parcel of the Lord, they also have independence. Because that same quality is in the Lord it is also inherent in the living entity, which is His energy. But there is a limit to his independence. He can either serve Krishna, or he can serve Krishna's external energy. That is his choice. That choice is given by Krishna, so that the living entity can make the right choice. And actually have a loving relationship with the Supreme Lord. The Lord is atmarama, aptakama, He is self-satisfied. He is complete in Himself. He is not dependent upon anything or anyone else for His own pleasure. He doesn't need anything here within this material world. He is fully self-satisfied. \nBut then why then does somebody who is self-satisfied ask for everything? This is the mystery of Bhagavad-gita. Why would somebody who is self-satisfied ask from everybody everything? Sounds as if something is not right. If he is self-satisfied it means He doesn't want anything so why is He asking for it? The point is that it's already His. Everything belongs to Him. So why does He ask for it? He asks it for our benefit. Because if we offer it to Him, we benefit. But of course there are different ways one can offer. One can offer something because He is thinking, \"I want to get something in return. The Lord has everything, He is the controller of everything, He can do anything, He is independent. Well, OK, I'll give something to Him. As long as I get something back.\" \nSo that can be a motivation to offer something to Him. But Krishna is not really pleased by such offerings, because that's not what actually satisfies Him. that's not what He wants from us. Whatever you may give Him, it already belongs to Him. We may give Him some money, but Krishna is already the wealthiest personality in all of creation. Not even Bill Gates can compare to Krishna. Krishna is a lot more wealthier than Bill Gates. He has created everything, therefore He can claim proprietorship of everything. Bill Gates can manipulate that which has already given by Krishna, but actually Krishna is the creator of everything. \nSo it's not that if we offer something to Krishna that Krishna wants what we offer to Him. He doesn't benefit at all. It's an illusion to think that you can bribe Him. Krishna is so independent that He cannot be bribed. There is no way that you can control Krishna by bribing Him with some material wealth, or some mundane offering. You can't bind Him into a contract.\nThis is a common practice in many places throughout the world\u2014bribery. But try doing it with Krishna. He can't be bribed. He doesn't need whatever you are going to offer Him. And neither can you say, \"Look, I am going to give You this, and here is a piece of paper, can you sign here. I want to make sure that I have it on paper in case I have to show it to somebody else that You didn't fulfill Your part of the bargain.\" No laws can control Krishna. Whether they are mundane laws, or even the laws of creation can't control Krishna. Krishna creates the laws, but He is not under the laws. Everything is ultimately created by Krishna, but He is always transcendental to everything that is in this material world.\nSo Krishna cannot be bribed. Still we may be motivated to give something to Him in order to get something in return. But He is not at all interested in whatever you may offer Him whether it be money or some other type of attractive offering that may appear to be appealing to Him, or to His senses. So why does Krishna ask for it? Again we are getting into this very essential question. Not only He is asking, He is insisting, \"Please, just give it to Me.\" \nKrishna asks for it for our benefit. He wants us to offer something to Him with love. What is the characteristic of love? The characteristic of love is when you want to do something to please the beloved. There is no piece of paper involved in the transaction, neither is there any personal consideration in the offering. When something is offered with love, then the person is not thinking about getting anything in return. That is the symptom of love. And that is the symptom of the self to experience that love. To experience that love is real freedom. It's real independence. Because one who actually has that love, especially when he is offering it to the Supreme Lord, then he is no longer bound by the laws of this world. That's real independence. Krishna guarantees that 'if you give everything to Me, I'll deliver you from all sinful reactions. I'll deliver you from the repetition of birth and death. And Krishna guarantees that just simply by giving something to Him with love, that one will ultimately achieve the supreme destination and will no longer come under the influence of the three modes of material nature.\nDaivi hy esa guna-mayi/ mama maya duratyaya. As Krishna says, these three modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, but one who surrenders unto Me, can very easily cross beyond it.\nSo our greatest freedom, our greatest independence is by this experience of offering something to the Lord with love. Because the quality of love is that I am doing it because I want to do it. Although Krishna is saying, please do it, then almost demanding. Krishna wants us to make the choice. He gives us that choice. He can't force us. He can only persist in His entreaties and His appeals and beg, \"Please, just do it for Me.\"\nBut as Prabhupada said here in this paragraph, generally people are enamored by the external energy of Krishna. And they wrongly think, that by advancement of material comforts, they will be happy. They think \"Yes, religion is nice, but let me make myself nice and comfortable first and then I'll do something for God. So He doesn't disturb things. I'll make everything comfortable, then I'll do something for Him, so He won't rock the boat. As long as I bribe Him then everything will be good, I'll be able to keep all that I have, keep my comforts.\"\nOf course a lot of people becomes disillusioned by this mentality, because it doesn't work that way. As we said, we can't bribe God. We can't say \"OK, I'll do this for You as long as You don't bring me any suffering.'\" Sometimes when people who approach God with this mentality, they think, \"Well, I did this, and now I am suffering, why did God do something like that? What kind of person is He?\" Sometimes even they give up religion. 'What's the value if I do this, I give something to Him and still I get punished. What kind of God is He? Sounds like He is a very ungrateful God. Doesn't He know I gave Him something? He should be grateful that I gave Him something.\"\nSo because people, they place value on this world, the comforts of this world, the pleasures of this world. They don't know that there is a place that is much greater than this world and Krishna is beckoning us to come there. He is calling us to come to that place, where there is no more birth, no more death, disease, old age. He says in Bhagavad-gita tad dhama paramam mama. \"It is my supreme destination, it is unmanifested, infallible, and the supreme destination. When one goes there, one never has to come back. That is my supreme abode.'\" \nKrishna is inviting everybody, \"Please, I want you to come back to Me, I don't want you to have to undergo this repeated birth and death.\" He personally descends into this world and into every universe throughout creation, and He speaks the message of Bhagavad-gita extending the same invitation to everybody. \"Please, just offer it to Me with love. Love means you are using your freedom, your independence and you're offering it to Me, because you want to please Me. And that's what I want from you. I don't want anything else, that's insignificant.\" It's just the expression of love, \"Yes, I am giving this to You, I recognize it doesn't belong to me.\"\nJust like the example that is given in the Srimad Bhagavatam. That when a person decorates his face in the mirror, the reflection is decorated at the same time. When you stand in front of the mirror, ladies, when you are putting on your make-up, decorating your face, do you put your make-up on the mirror? No, you don't have to, it's already there. So in the same way, when we offer something to Krishna, we benefit. We give something to Him, we derive the benefit. And what is the benefit that we derive? Well, it's incalculable. You can't even imagine it. If you have never experienced a moment of it, it's very difficult to imagine it. But even if you experienced one moment of it, you'll never forget it. That's how incalculable it is, even one moment of that experience, you'll never forget. It makes a permanent impression on the heart, then if you try to engage in external activities, and try to look for pleasure through that means, it's insignificant, it's incomparable.\nThat pleasure is the pleasure that Krishna wants to give everybody. It's ananda, it's ever increasing pleasure. Krishna wants everyone to experience that taste. Because even a moment of that taste will never be lost. We may apparently forget it, but Krishna doesn't. He doesn't forget it, because He is a person. We forget about that. He is a person, and He is knowing. He says, I know all living beings, past, present, and future, but Me, it's difficult to know. Krishna remembers everything. Krishna tells Arjuna \"Many many births both you and I have had, I can remember all of them, Arjuna, but you cannot remember.\" He remembers everything. He doesn't forget. Because He is all-knowing. That's one of His characteristics, that's one of the characteristics of the Supreme Lord, is that He is all-knowing. He is seated within everyone's heart. He knows everything. He knows our desires, better than we do. And He knows if we are trying to bribe Him, or if we are trying to please Him. He knows, we can't cheat Him. Because He knows, He is right there in the heart along with us.\nSometimes we think, \"Maybe, I can do this, nobody is looking.\" We are trying to do something that we know we are not supposed to be doing. but \"Now it's the best time, nobody is looking.\" What an illusion. What do you mean, nobody is looking? Krishna knows. That is one of His manifestations, as the Supersoul in the heart of every living being, He is looking. He knows. You can't hide it from Him. He is all knowing, it means He knows everything. He knows all living beings. So Krishna remembers, when you do something for Him. You may forget, but Krishna doesn't forget.\nThen sometimes people may ask, \"I did something for Him, then why am I suffering now? Why am I in so much anxiety? Why do I have so many difficulties?\" It's because Krishna didn't forget. We don't realize it. We are just asking so many questions, \"Why is He doing this? Why is He doing that? Why am I in this situation? Why am I in anxiety? Why am I suffering?\" But it is because Krishna didn't forget that you did something for Him, and He is so grateful, that He wants you to experience more of that same pleasure that He gave you when you did something for Him.\nIn the Caitanya caritamrita it is stated \"When my devotee engages in sense gratification and he wants the opulence of material enjoyment, He is like a fool who willingly gives up nectar to drink poison. Why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take shelter of my lotus feet, and make him forget these things.\"\nSo Krishna wants the devotee to continue in His loving service. And then the next verse explains that when the devotee approaches the Lord for some material benediction the Lord will fulfill his desire in such a way that the devotee won't come back and ask for it again. That's Krishna's mercy. That's His kindness. We think \"I am suffering\" but Krishna is thinking \"No, actually you don't have to suffer. Don't you know you did something for me before, and I can't forget you.\" \nEspecially when you do something for His devotee. That's so dear to Krishna, when you do something for His devotee. When you do something for His devotee, then Krishna becomes so pleased. Because the devotee of the Lord is somebody who has given everything for the service of the Lord. And that's the message Srila Prabhupada has given in Bhagavad-gita As It Is. That is the essence of the instructions of Bhagavad-gita that Prabhupada has given to the world. And Prabhupada showed by his life, by his example, by his words, by everything, that he was fully, one hundred percent, cent percent dedicated to serving and pleasing Krishna. Such a devotee of the Lord is so dear to Krishna. He is so dear that whenever you do something for such a devotee of the Lord, Krishna will take notice. Krishna even says, 'Don't give it to Me, give it to him because he knows how to use everything for me. So give it to him. Because he knows how to please me. I am so pleased by his activities. He gives me so much pleasure.\" And the devotee who serves the Lord in this mood, he also experiences so much pleasure in pleasing the Lord. And because he has tasted that pleasure he wants to distribute that pleasure for others to experience. He knows that that pleasure is greater than any other pleasure one can possibly experience in this world. By dint of his own realization he knows. He knows that anybody else in this world who is simply under the influence of Krishna's external energy, they are just destined to suffer. And out of compassion for them he is thinking 'How can I induce them to do something for Krishna.\" He feels that compassion in his heart. It is burning in his heart.\nThat's how Srila Prabhupada was thinking when he was present here on this planet. His heart was burning with compassion, \"How to get this message to everyone, as many people as possible?\" And the devotees who were present during Srila Prabhupada's manifest presence in this world, they felt Prabhupada's sense of urgency. He heard it from his own spiritual master. His own spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaja told Srila Prabhupada, \"This message is urgent. It cannot wait.\"\nWhen Srila Prabhupada met his spiritual master for the first time in 1922, he came with his friend to see Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaja, because he was told that he is a very nice, saintly person. And Prabhupada came into the room, he bowed down because Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a saintly person and he could see that. And before Prabhupada even got up from offering his obeisances, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta gave him his life's mission. \"You two look like intelligent men, why don't you take this message of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and distribute it all of the world, in the English-speaking world?\" And Srila Prabhupada, he was at that time he was young householder, and he tried to offer some argument, he said \"Who will hear our message as long as we are a dependent nation, dependent upon the British, we must first get our independence, and then people will hear our message.\" And Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaja told him that the message of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is so important, it is so urgent, it cannot wait. He said that there is no question of independence, one power will be in control, after some time another power will be in control. \"What is the meaning of this so-called independence?\" He said Caitanya Mahaprabhu's message is real independence. It is urgent, and it cannot wait. Because everyone is gliding down to hell, to suffer repeated birth and death. \nSo Prabhupada had that same sense of urgency. His heart was filled with compassion. He wanted everybody to experience just a little of that taste, just to get the opportunity to get a little of that taste. And Krishna arranges it in such a way, that you can get that taste by serving His pure devotee. By doing something that will please him, you can please Krishna. You can do both at the same time. You can please Prabhupada and you can please Krishna at the same time. Prabhupada had that power, he had that potency to express what is his desire and he expressed in such a way that the devotees became mad after fulfilling Prabhupada's desires. All Prabhupada had to say was what his desire was, and immediately devotees were driven like mad, running after the opportunity. And during Srila Prabhupada's manifest presence it was crystal clear in everyone of his follower's eyes, what one had to do if they wanted to please Prabhupada.\nPrabhupada pushed us. Any of my godbrothers will testify. We felt pushed, but Prabhupada didn't push us by beating us with whips. He didn't have to beat, he didn't have to demand, he didn't have to do anything. All he had to do was express what his desire was. Devotees would always just wait, \"What's the latest message from Prabhupada.\" As soon as Prabhupada said something, it would resonate throughout the whole world of the Vaisnavas. Every time Prabhupada came out with a quote, immediately all the telephones would be ringing in all of the temples, \"Prabhupada said this, Prabhupada said this.\" I'll never forget the quote that Prabhupada said in Atlanta, when it spread out throughout all the temples. I think Ladvamsi Prabhu was with me at that time. Prabhupada said that \"The devotees, who travel in vans and distribute my books, get my extra special mercy.\" And I remember at that time I was driving in the van, and we were distributing books, and we were distributing long hours. Ladvamsi Prabhu, he and I traveled together for quite some time. You might wonder why the two of us are so close. It is because both of us tasted that nectar together. That taste of doing something that Prabhupada was asking us to do.\nAnd the most wonderful taste is not only when you are doing something that Prabhupada asked you to do but when you get the confirmation in your heart that Prabhupada is pleased. That taste drives you mad. There is nothing like it, it just drives you mad. You always want to get more and more, to get the confirmation in your heart, 'Yes, Prabhupada is pleased, Prabhupada is pleased.\" And Prabhupada would say again and again if you want to please me, preach and distribute my books. He just made it so clear, so crystal clear to all of his followers that if we wanted to do something to please him, then this was the opportunity\u2014 to preach and distribute his books. Because Prabhupada, every single day, he was translating Bhagavatam, Caitanya caritamrita. And Prabhupada wanted these Caitanya caritamritas published and distributed.\n[To Dhanesvara Prabhu] Were you in the BBT at that time? No? No, he wasn't. When Prabhupada was working so hard, up every night doing the translations of Caitanya caritamrita, giving his commentaries, and they were all backed up, and nothing was being published. And Prabhupada was becoming very concerned and he asked on a morning walk in Los Angeles. Many of the devotees who were with Prabhupada were working at the BBT in Los Angeles, because part of the BBT was in Los Angeles at that time, And Prabhupada asked them, \"What is happening, where is Caitanya caritamrita, I've been working so hard, why has nothing been published?\" And he said \"I want you to give me a plan how long this will take to publish these books.\"\nSo the devotees who were on the morning walk, who were part of the BBT, they stepped back and discussed amongst themselves, the strategy, to bring back to offer to Prabhupada and how they were going to publish. They started discussing different ideas and how they can increase the transcribing and increase the layout and the best possible effort they can possibly make and they finally decided that they will be able to publish one book in every two months. And they thought Prabhupada will be very pleased to hear this. We have a plan how to publish Caitanya caritamrita. A solid plan. So they said \"Let's go and to catch up to Prabhupada now and to tell him what our plan is.\" So they said, \"Srila Prabhupada, we have discussed amongst ourselves, and now we decided, we have a plan, so we can begin a publication of your Caitanya caritamrita, and we will publish one book every two months.\" And they thought Prabhupada is going to be so pleased. Prabhupada turned to them and said, \"No. I want all volumes, seventeen ,published in two months.\" And the devotees said, \"Prabhupada, that's impossible.\" Prabhupada took his cane and he dug it in the sand. \"Impossible is a word only in a fool's dictionary.\" \nThe devotees, you can imagine, what was going through their brains. So Prabhupada did push a little bit [laughter]. So the devotees had to step back again and deal with this one. Because if Prabhupada said he wanted it, that was it, you just don't calculate, you can't calculate according to material formulas. When Prabhupada says he wants something done, that's it, it has to be done. Prabhupada already destroyed the \"impossible\" option. So that option wasn't available anymore. He completely destroyed it. There was only one option left. So that's what they had to discuss. \"We have only one option left. What are we going to do?\" And then they started discussing amongst themselves, and they said, \"Maybe we can bring all the devotees from New York, who are working at the pre-press and bring them to Los Angeles. And get all the artists together in one place and begin working on the art for the books. So they came up with the scheme of how they could possibly do it by bringing all the resources possible from everywhere throughout the world and bring them all to Los Angeles, where they would work tirelessly to complete the publication of these books in two months. And devotees came back and told Prabhupada, \"Prabhupada, we have this plan, we want to bring all the devotees to Los Angeles, and this is how we think we will be able to fulfill your desires.\" And Prabhupada said, \"Do it.\"\nSo they made all kinds of arrangements. They brought the devotees from all over the world to Los Angeles and began a two-month marathon. If you look at the paintings in Caitanya caritamrita, you'll have to understand, that most of the paintings were done by about maybe four or five different artists, each painting. Because the artist would simply sit in front of the easel to paint until he would just fall asleep. And then when he would fall asleep on the floor, another devotee would carry him away, put him to bed, and put another artist. And when that one would fall on the floor and then they would bring in another artist. And that's how most of the paintings for Caitanya caritamrita were done. Some of them weren't very detailed. There are so many different styles, but that was just the art department. Then there was the transcribers who would stay up all night long. The devotees they would tell these stories how they would stay up all night. They brought these fast typists who would stay up all night long and would just transcribe until the early morning hours and then other transcribers would come and take over. \nAnd there was no layout software in those days. It was not that you could just open up Pagemaker or Quark, and just lay everything out quickly. The layout was done much differently those days. The devotees again worked all day, all night, all day, all night, all day, all night. And there was a certain taste. There is a certain taste when you are making that sacrifice to please Krishna's devotee. And they published those seventeen books in two months. And after they were published then what we were supposed to do with them? Well, we distributed them.\nI remember when those Caitanya caritamritas used to come to the temple, when each volume was published, as soon as they came off truck and they came into the temple, we would open up the boxes, load up our bags and we would go out and start to distribute them. And we didn't even think to save one for ourselves to read. Nobody thought of it, the books would come and we would just think, \"Prabhupada wants these books distributed!\" It wasn't till after we had distributed them all we realized, \"Hey, wait a minute, we didn't keep one for ourselves!\" We had to order more books from the BBT in order to get another printing so that the temple could then get books for the devotees to read for themselves and to put in the libraries. \nThis was the mood that actually, everybody experienced and was caught up in during the 1970s. Prabhupada just simply created a revolution. And we all felt like we were all revolutionaries from the spiritual world. And Prabhupada was the general. I remember when Prabhupada was in New York, in Manhattan, it was a thirteen-story building. When we got that building in Manhattan and Prabhupada was sitting on the roof, and he was looking like a general in the army, ready to take over the world. And he was leading the revolution by the distribution of his books. \nHis books carried that same simple message which we spoke about in the first part of our presentation. That everybody is looking for an opportunity, everybody's nature is to please somebody. And Prabhupada's heart was so magnanimous that he gave us a mission that can include everybody. He wanted that everyone should experience the opportunity to distribute his books. And then of course we know that according to the history in our society, in one year the devotees kind of spontaneously started a marathon. This was a different marathon. We talked about the two-month publishing marathon when publishing Prabhupada's books. But in the 1970s, Prabhupada was oftentimes quoting many times about the importance of distributing his books. And the devotees caught up that mood, and they started to think of different ways to distribute. Prabhupada said, \"Please, tax your brains in different ways, how to distribute my books.\"\nAnd I am pretty sure it was in 1972, in 1972 the devotees were going out and distributing books during the Christmas season. It was the devotees in Los Angeles, where the BBT was situated. They realized that there are more people out on the street at this time of the year, because everybody was going out shopping and buying presents. And so the devotees, who went out to distribute books, they started to think, \"Why don't we put in an extra effort to stay out longer, and distribute Prabhupada's books?\" And everybody was thinking of it all at the same time. It wasn't planned, it was spontaneous. One devotee who was in charge of the BBT at that time, he relates how he was out distributing books before Christmas and he decided to stay out late one night, although nobody was staying out late. So on that night he just decided, \"I am going to stay out late. There are so many people out shopping. Why should I go back to the temple?\" So he stayed out until about eleven o'clock, distributing books. Then he was thinking, well maybe I should go back to the temple now, everybody is probably back, sleeping by now, tired of waiting for me.\nUsually everybody would come back and they would tell their experiences of book distribution for the day. So he was thinking, \"I don't want to make everybody wait up for me, so I should probably go back now, it's eleven o'clock, everybody will be waiting for me.\" So he went back to the temple. And he thought that everybody was going to be there waiting for him, and he said \"Where is everybody, everybody went to sleep?\" And one devotee said, \"No, you are the first one back\". \"What do you mean I am the first one back? I stayed out until eleven o'clock.\" \"Nobody else has come back yet.\" So then they waited and waited, and finally about one thirty in the morning, devotees started coming back. And they all got the idea at the same time.\nAnd that was the birth of the Prabhupada Marathon. Of course those days it was called Christmas Marathon. Because it was the Christmas season, which really pushed everybody to take advantage of all the people who were available who could get Prabhupada's books, and could read this message right here in Bhagavad-gita. It was in the following year in 1973 that everywhere else, devotees decided to take up the same mood. I think that Ladvamsi you hadn't moved in to the temple yet that year. You moved in in 1974. But I was in the temple. And the Christmas Marathon meant that you leave on December 1st, and you come back on Christmas day to the temple. And everything was optimized so that you could spend as much time as possible out, on the streets distributing Srila Prabhupada's books.\nWe would go out early in the morning as soon as the stores would open and we would be standing there in front of the stores. And it wasn't till the last person came out of the store that we would go back. And we would do that every day. Seven days a week. Twelve hours a day, From nine o'clock in the morning, till nine o'clock at night. And it was hard. It definitely wasn't easy. But there was a certain taste in pushing yourself to do something that Prabhupada wanted to be done. It was almost as if \"I know there is something more I can get from it and I don't want to miss it. But Prabhupada wants a little more from me, so before he will give it to me.\"\n[Dhanesvara Prabhu speaks out, \"What about competition?\"] Competition between the temples? Prabhupada started that too. But that's another whole story, how Prabhupada started the competition. And of course we may think, competition, is mundane. It's material. But Prabhupada destroyed that too. Prabhupada had a way of destroying any doubt. He told us, \"No, there is competition in the spiritual world. The gopis are all competing to get Krishna's attention. So he said, if there is competition in the spiritual world, therefore there is competition here. And therefore competition can be transcendental, when it is aimed for Krishna's pleasure. Of course sometimes one can forget. This type of competition is not good. Spiritual competition means, you always want the other devotee to do more, to do better. Although you'll try hard, very very hard to do the best you possibly can. You'll always be pleased, when you hear that somebody does better. Because it's for Krishna. Why shouldn't we be pleased if somebody does more than I do? Why shouldn't we be pleased when somebody distributes more books than I can distribute? Prabhupada is pleased. Prabhupada was so pleased that in 1972, when the devotee wrote a letter to Srila Prabhupada and told him about that spontaneous marathon, Prabhupada said \" I am so pleased to hear how you have increased the distribution of my books. This is wonderful, it is amazing.\" I can't remember how many thousands of books, maybe seventeen thousand books were distributed in three days. And this was just one temple. And Prabhupada then wrote at the bottom of this letter, he said \"Anyone who goes out, and distributes my books like this, it is guaranteed that they will all go back to Godhead.\" Imagine what that quote did. So many of those quotes when they would come out during those years, when Prabhupada would make a statement, everybody would get on the phone. \"Prabhupada said this, Prabhupada said that.\" The letter would immediately circulate all over the movement.\nOne year the devotees asked Prabhupada, because the devotees wanted to distribute candy canes to people on the streets to stop them so they can distribute books, you know those little candies shaped like a cane with those red and white stripes. That is used at Christmas time. The devotees asked Prabhupada, \"Can we distribute it to stop people so we can get their attention to give them a book?\" They said \"Prabhupada, we want to offer it to Krishna, we want people to get prasadam, can we offer it to the deities?\" He said, \"Yes, for preaching you can offer it to the deities.\" So as soon as Prabhupada said that, on all the altars, all over the world the devotees were offering candy canes to the deities. And the devotees were going out and distributing candy canes to stop people to give them Prabhupada's books. As soon as Prabhupada said anything, everybody would hear it and it would go everywhere.\nI remember one time, of course, so many quotes Prabhupada gave about book distribution, I could quote you so many. It was definitely at 1975, that I recall that Prabhupada was really, really pushing, and I think it was in 1975, he told one devotee, the president of the temple in Chicago, it was Sri Govinda. This was when the Marathon had been going on already for a couple of years and Prabhupada was seeing how many books were being distributed. Prabhupada told Sri Govinda, he said \"One devotee should stay back at the temple and do all the service to the deities and everybody else should go out. Do you remember that one Ladvamsi? Prabhupada said that to one devotee, but as soon as the quote came out, it started going all over the world, and before you knew it the temples were just emptying out. And then it became a tradition every year, during that time of the year to get as many devotees out on book distribution as possible.\nAnd then I was telling the devotees in Minsk, it's a long story, I have already been speaking almost two hours. But it was in 1977. It was the November, 1977. And the devotees, we had already been doing the Marathon for many years. And we knew Prabhupada at that time was ill. He was in Vrindavana. Many of the leaders had been called to Vrindavana because they thought Prabhupada would depart soon. And, I'll make the story a little shorter, but essentially Prabhupada had given an indication to many of the devotees who were with him, that Krishna had given him the choice whether he would stay or leave. Because Prabhupada was very ill, he hadn't eaten for months. He was only taking a little liquid every day. He was becoming very emaciated. He was saying that \"This body is simply a bag of bones.\" He said, \"Don't think this won't happen to you. How to give up this body, everyone has to give up this body in due course of time.\" \nPrabhupada gave some indication that he was thinking it was time for him to depart. Because for Prabhupada to depart simply meant going back to Krishna. But at one point Prabhupada had given an indication in a conversation to the devotees that Krishna had given him the choice, whether to depart or not. Then all the leaders, they all got together to discuss among themselves, \"What should we do. Should we ask Prabhupada to stay, or is it selfish on our part to ask Prabhupada to stay? Are we being selfish Prabhupada wants to go, and we're asking Prabhupada to stay?\" So it was a very long discussion. Whether the devotees should ask Prabhupada to stay, or let Prabhupada go? And after a long discussion they decided, that \"Actually, we should ask Prabhupada to stay. The world needs him, he hasn't finished Srimad Bhagavatam.\" Of course Prabhupada knew that he may not finish Srimad Bhagavatam, and that's why one of the first books he published was Krishna Book, the summary study of the Tenth Canto. But the devotees were thinking \"Prabhupada hasn't finished Srimad Bhagavatam. He hasn't given his greatest contribution, this Srimad Bhagavatam to the world.\" So they decided that they were going to go back into the room and they were going to ask Prabhupada that \"Prabhupada, if Krishna has given you the choice, please stay.\" So they selected one person to speak on all of their behalf. They all went to Srila Prabhupada's room, and the devotee was approaching Srila Prabhupada's bed, and he broke down and he was crying, all the other devotees were crying . And the other devotees, they were putting their hands on his shoulder, patting him, encouraging him to \"Go ahead, say it, say it! Don't forget what we discussed, you have to say it.\" So finally he just came out and said \"Srila Prabhupada, you have told us that Krishna has given you the choice, so all of us have discussed amongst ourselves and we want to tell you that if Krishna has given you the choice, so please, stay. \" Then Prabhupada said \"Do you want me to stay?\" And the devotee said, \"Yes, Prabhupada, we want you to stay.\" So Prabhupada said, \"OK, I'll stay\". Very causal.\nAs soon as Prabhupada said that it went all over the world. All the temple telephones were ringing, \"Prabhupada said he is going to stay, Prabhupada said, he's going to stay.\" We were thinking, \"Prabhupada is going to stay.\" I had it fixed in my mind, \"Prabhupada said he's going to stay, he's going to finish Bhagavatam.\" All the devotees were thinking the same way. \"Prabhupada said he is going to stay.\" So we just went on our service. At that particular time I was in charge of a book distribution center for training new devotees how to distribute books. They were all uninitiated devotees, about fifteen or twenty of them, I was taking them out showing them how to distribute books and we had a special center specifically for training new devotees in the Northeast United States. All of us were going to Boston one particular evening. I can't remember what purpose we were going there to the Boston Temple. But we were a little bit late. So I stopped at a payphone to call the temple president, to tell him that all of us were still coming, And when I got the temple president on the other end, he told me at that moment, he said \"Prabhupada left.\" And of course, Prabhupada always had his choice. But somehow Krishna decided for him to leave. And for the devotees throughout the whole world, it was very difficult time. We didn't know what to do, Our father, our Lord, our Master, our worshipful savior. He had just departed for the spiritual world. And all we had left was Prabhupada's instructions that he had taught us. And this was just a couple, maybe two weeks before the beginning of December. And devotees all around the world were thinking \"What can we possibly do to bring Prabhupada back with us and please him. So our only solace was remembering what pleased Prabhupada the most. His heart was so filled with compassion, he wanted these books distributed in every corner of the world, and he told us \"I will live forever in my books.\" So just imagine, what happened in that December of 1977. It was the biggest Marathon in the history of ISKCON. The devotees, just everybody went out and pushed, and pushed, and pushed. Because we felt that \"Yes, this is what Prabhupada wanted, this was his desire. If we want to stay connected and get confirmation in our hearts, than we have to fulfill his desires.\nSo there is a certain sweetness, there is a certain taste in making sacrifice. To please Krishna's pure devotee. And Prabhupada was so magnanimous that he didn't restrict it to just to his own disciples. Prabhupada made it clear that he will live forever in his books. He would say so many different things, that for thousands of years his books will become the law books of mankind. So how could he simply restrict the taste which is available through Krishna's pure devotee, to his own immediate followers. That same taste in pleasing Srila Prabhupada is accessible to anybody who understands his glory, who knows that he's Krishna's pure devotee who has no desire separate from Krishna's desire. And by doing something, and pushing ourselves to please him, we please Krishna. And if we can please Krishna, even for a moment, than our spiritual life begins. Krishna will not forget. Especially when you do something for His devotee. Krishna will never forget.\nSo we should understand these teachings that Srila Prabhupada gave us in this life. We should take the opportunity, This is the time of the year when devotees can get that opportunity to organize themselves in such a way to go out and do something that will please Prabhupada. I guarantee that even if just once you experience this taste of pushing yourself to do something that is pleasing to Srila Prabhupada, you will never forget it.\nOf course Krishna has given you your choice. Krishna is giving everybody their own choice, the freedom to choose. But if you make the choice, and use your independence that Krishna has given to you, to voluntarily do something, and push to please Krishna's pure devotee, Prabhupada will be pleased. Krishna will be pleased, and your devotional service will be guaranteed. Krishna says ya idam paramam guhyam \"One who explains this secret of Bhagavad-gita to others, for him devotional service is guaranteed. And at the end he comes back to me. Na ca tasman manusyesu/ kascin me priya-krttamah. There is no servant in this world, who is more dear to Me than he. Nor will there ever be one who is more dear.\" Imagine how dear Prabhupada is to Krishna for giving us this Bhagavad-gita. Bhagavad-gita As It Is. In the same way as Krishna intended it. In the same way that Krishna spoke to Arjuna, that same message is preserved in Bhagavad-gita As It Is. We all have a debt to Srila Prabhupada. Anybody who calls himself a follower of Srila Prabhupada has an eternal debt to him. \nPlease, I am not pushing. Prabhupada is pushing. This is not my desire. This is Prabhupada's desire. Catch it, take it. Organize yourself and organize others, take advantage, experience this taste. And take advantage of the season, even if it's cold outside. It's OK. Wear warm clothes and go out to distribute Prabhupada's Bhagavad-gita. Become fortunate, and make others fortunate. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.\n","nid":"954"},{
"title":"Transcription of A Talk Given to Counselors on the Subject of Divorce","ref":"","attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions"],"date":"Tue, 2009-11-24 07:08","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a partially edited transcription of the talk I gave during the Kiev Counselor Retreat on the subject of divorce:\n \nSo I am once again happy that I am able to attend your National Counselor Retreat. As all of you know I've been very eager to see this program develop here as well as in other places, because I have observed how beneficial it is for the spiritual and social welfare of the devotees when there is a nice community spirit, especially if you want to base the community on spiritual principles. \nI could understand that was one reason why all of you underwent that exercise that which you did this morning, because as I observed, for you, the subject of divorce is certainly an important issue for maintaining a good community, among many other issues as well. But this particular issue is important because we see how disrupted people's lives become when there is disunity. Sometimes we speak about disunity on a very large scale in terms of a Vaisnava community. But we can also see how disruptive disunity is even when it's on a small scale beginning with one family unit. Because it doesn't stop there. It's one family then two, then three, then four, then five, and then people begin to think this is the status quo. \"Well he did it, she did it, they did it.\" So it has a cummulative effect which affects not only the family unit, and especially the children, but then it also affects the greater community of devotees.\nAnd therefore I understood why you spent so much time discussing that particular issue this morning. \nThis is not the theme I planned to discuss when I came here. In fact, I didn't plan to discuss any particular theme. I just planned to come and just to be with you, to observe and to contribute whatever I could to the overall topic of taking care of devotees. But since there was such a protracted discussion on this topic this morning, I thought I would take a little time to continue on this topic and try to contribute a little something to solidify the importance of \"no divorce.\" \nOf course, there are some places in our Society where divorse completely unaccepted. If there's divorce, then no matter what position you have\u2026 in fact even in ISKCON, overall in this Society, if somebody divorces then they not supposed to take a leadership role. Of course, sometimes there are exceptions. \"Well I'm a victim. My spouse left me. I didn't initiate this divorce.\" That oftentimes becomes a partial consideration for adjusting according to time, place and circumstance. But very often it's not always so cut and dry. Sometimes the person will claim to be the victim but they could have also been a major contributor for the divorce.\nTherefore I appreciated one of the summary points that I think was given by Adikavi this morning. One of his summary points was that everybody should try to look within themselves to see what they could possibly can do or what they possibly did to contribute to the problem. It's always a good place to search there. I know that even for myself, when I see devotees whose spiritual lives are affected, I feel a sense of responsibility as their spiritual master. I tend to become introspective and to think what possibly could I have done to help that person to avoid this. Or maybe there was something that I should have done and didn't do. So it's good to be introspective before it happens. \nBut the tendency is to always think about it when it's unfortunately too late and the situation is already irreversible.\nThis particular point about unity in family life is a very important part of the responsibility for everyone who is taking the position of being a leader and guiding others. Because as we see that the majority of devotees who are assembled for this gathering are householders. The brahmacaris, some of them felt very outnumbered, and they felt inclined to accept the invitation to leave, and some of them did leave during your dicussion. But the majority of people stayed for a valid reason. Because the majority of you who are here to discuss the topic about spiritual counseling and caring for devotees are householders. And therefore if you actually want to take care of others one of the first responsibilities you find yourself having to take is the responsibility to be a good example. \nPrabhupada speaks about that in Bhagavad-gita, yad yad acarati sresthas/ tad tad evetaro janah, the verse in Bhagavad-gita, that if you want to teach, you have to be an example. Without example, how can you teach? Even the Supreme Lord takes that position so that He can teach. The Supreme Lord appears as a devotee in order to teach how to be a devotee. So even the Supreme Lord takes the responsibility to be an example so that He can teach. And therefore He sets the example for others to follow. Not only as Lord Caitanya did He teach about devotional service, but also Lord Krishna as a householder in Dvaraka. He also taught by His example. And there are also many examples given in the scriptures about household life. \nThere is the famous example. I oftentimes quote the example from the Aditya Purana. I won't tell the whole story, because if we tell the whole story it will take the rest of my alloted time. But it's the story of the woman whose husband was a leper who wanted to enjoy a prostitute, and how by her chastity to her husband she defeated her husband. She won. She defeated him because she was so faithful to the desires of her husband that she even became the servant of the prostitute her husband wanted to enjoy so that the prostitute would accept her husband's desires. As I said it's a long story and if I tell the whole story, I'll lose my alloted time.\nBut somebody may say that's taking it a little bit too far isn't it? \"Should we actually take that example from the scripture and use that as an example. My husband wants to go to enjoy a prostitute, should I go and serve the prostitute?\"\nBut there was an appropriate outcome and that's why the example is used. Because by the wife's chastity, she defeated her husband, and the husband realized how degraded and fallen he was and gave up his desire, with the help of the prostitute. She also helped to defeat the husband. \nAfter the prostitute understood the intentions of the brahmana's wife in serving her, she invited the wife and her husband to come to dinner the following day. Before they arrived she prepared two types of food\u2014 some very nice prasadam, sattvic prasadam, and she put that on a leaf plate and put water in a clay cup. She also prepared some rajasic food. Something unmentionable, And she placed that on a beautiful silver plate and the rajasic drink was put into a gold goblet. \nWhen they both arrived, she said to the brahmana, \"I prepared these different kinds of food. Please, take whatever you wish.\" So the brahmana immediately sat down in front of the leaf plate and the clay pot and took the very nice, sattvic prasadam. And then, after he finished eating, she asked \"So, are you satisfied?\" He said \"Yes, I am fully satisfied.\" Then she said, \"Well, you see, because you are a brahmana by nature, you accepted this type of food. And you are not interested in that food, even though it's in a silver plate and a gold goblet. Do you see that silver plate, and gold goblet? That's me. Do you see that nice plate of prasadam you just ate? Even though it was on a very simple leaf plate and a clay pot, you chose that instead. That is your wife. It doesn't make any difference what's on the outside. Why are you so interested in me, simply because I have nice outside covering.\"\nSo the brahman realized. \"Yes, why did I want to enjoy this woman simply because of her bodily beauty.\" And he began crying. And he understood that, \"Yes, you are as good as my spiritual master.\" He then realized that he was very sinful in his desire, and left that place. \nAnyways, the principle is that the wife defeated her husband by her chastity, and even took up the service of the prostitute, to satisfy the desire of her husband. \nActually I also think of one, I used this story many times, but since it's relevant, I'll tell it again. It's a practical experience I had. Maybe some of you have not heard the story. \nMany years ago in Boston there was an Indian woman who used to come to the temple all the time. She was very enthusiastic, participating in the temple functions, and other temple affairs. She was often quoting verses from Bhagavad-gita during class. When someone else would give a class, she would always enthusiastically speak out and support the speaker with verses from the Bhagavad-gita. And sometimes she would make the announcements on Sunday and try to get the congregation inspired by quoting many slokas from the Bhagavad-gita and by preaching.\nBut most of the time she would come alone. She didn't come with her husband, though he did come from time to time. Her son used to come too. And her son started to look at me sort of like a father figure. He used to come and talk to me and tried to get instructions from me about life. And sometimes we would sit and talk for quite some time, and I would instruct him in the best way I could according to his particular needs. He thanked me for these instructions and soon thereafter, he was preparing himself to get married. And based upon some of the things I told him, he had felt that he had much better perspective how to live as a householder. He came and thanked me for all the instructions and time that I had given to him. And then very shortly thereafter he got married and he moved someplace else. Soon after he got married, I got a letter from his mother. \nShe was a woman probably in her mid-sixties, and she wrote me a long letter about her life. She asked me to keep the content of her letter confidential, because at the time she was a member of the community and she didn't want the things that she was disclosing in her letter to be known to others. But she told me in her letter. She said, \"I want you to know that from my very birth, I was born in a Vaisnava family.\" She said \"I've never told you this, but Vaisnavism is my life. Chanting Hare Krishna is my life. Studying Bhagavad-gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, holy scriptures is my life.\" She said 'But for some reason, unknown to me even today.\" Oh, also she said \"Meat or any kind of rajasic food, tobacco, nothing ever touched my lips in my whole life.\"\nThen she said \"But for some reason unknown to me even today, my father married me to a man who would not follow even one regulative principle. I do not know why my father did that. And I can't even answer that today. But I lived with that man for forty-five years, and now my last child is married, thanks to you.\" She said, \"I've fulfilled my duties in my life.\" She also said, \"My husband, he would have his own life. He would eat meat outside the house, but I continued, and I stayed, I raised my children and now they are all married and gone.\" She said, \"I pray that you bless me. I beg you, please, accept me as your disciple and also bless me and allow me to travel to sacred places of pilgrimege, and purify my heart so I can hear and chant the glories of the Lord for the rest of my life.'\nI was thinking \" This woman has a lot of realization.\" I told the story to Dhanesvara Prabhu just before we came here. Although it was a little shorter version, and his comment was 'Yes, 'earned' realizations.\" Those realizations were earned by her life's experience. \nAnd she would never complain. She said I am the first person she ever told these things to. She just accepted it. \"This is my duty. I accepted it as my duty.\" And she gave forty-five years of her life following that duty. And she earned that realization.\nI appreciated that. Actually a very important factor in this discussion is the principle of following one's duty. I could see that there was no other reason why this woman stayed. She stayed, because she saw it as her duty. She saw it as a duty to her father, because that was the system, it was the Vedic system\u2014 that the father found a husband for his daughter. She saw it as her duty to her husband. She saw it as a duty to her children. She never complained to her children, she just raised her children until they were all married and out of the house. \nWell somebody may challenge that and say, \"Well, Prabhupada says in Caitanya caritamrita, that a woman should leave a fallen husband.\" Prabhupada did quote that in Caitanya caritamrita, in one commentary. He was giving it as evidence in the story of, I believe, Amogha. That if the husband is fallen a woman can leave her fallen husband. But I understand the word fallen in this way. Prabhupada used that evidence because of the circumstances. He saw the degradation of Kali-yuga, especially in the West. And also because there are some husbands, not devotees, who unfortunately do a lot of worse things than this husband did to his wife. But in the case of this Indian woman, the husband never mistreated his wife. That was also part of her story, that 'Physically he never mistreated me. He just wouldn't follow any of the principles.\"\nSo anyways, I've used that in discussions before as an example which I feel is relevant, the importance of executing one's duty. A husband and wife have a duty to each other and that is to somehow stay together, especially when there is children. Especially. Not only, but especially when there's children. Because it creates so much disturbance in society. \nGenerally people, they use the excuse, \"Oh, we are incompatible.\" How many times I've heard that. \"Incompatible.\" It's a very very common excuse I hear sometimes. \"We just don't think in the same way. we are different people.\"\nYou, as leaders, have a responsibility. If you have to take care of devotees then you have to help them to determine what is the basis of their incompatibility. Because the real basis of compatibility for devotees is to be compatible in Krishna Consciousness together. Krishna should be the center of the family. And serving the Supreme Lord, worshiping the deity, and performing the duties of a householder, they should be the center of the family.\nIn the Eleventh Canto of the Bhagavatam in Lord Krishna's instructions to Uddhava when He is instructing about the various varnas and asramas, He says that the duties of the householder are protection of all living entities and sacrifice. He gives these as the two most important duties of a householder. Those are Krishna's instructions to Uddhava.\nProtection of all living entities means that they are supposed to be the one asrama that maintains the other asramas. The householder is supposed to provide food to feed the other asramas. In the Seventh Canto of the Bhagavatam in Narada Muni's instructions to Yudisthira, he says the householder's duty is even to feed the animals. So sacrifice means to perform sacrifice for the benefit of others. And it also means that their lives are also meant to be a sacrifice. Household life is a sacrifice. It's voluntarily accepting this sacrifice to live together for a period of time throughout your life and to perform the responsibilities and duties as householders together.\nThere is a difference between sacrifice and enjoyment. Sometimes we think that householder life is a license for sense gratification. Yes, Prabhupada does say that, \"Householder life is a license for sense gratification.\" But what is a license meant to do? Why people get licenses to drive cars? They give licenses to drive cars because it's understood they are supposed to know how to drive cars before they get the license. It's to regulate people who don't know how to drive a car from getting behind the wheel. Right? If you don't have a license, you don't get behind the wheel.\nSo the license is meant for regulation. It's meant for restriction. Yes, it's a license for sense gratification. But restricted sense gratification. According to the duties of household life. And then it becomes a sacrifice. Because one is performing it according to the prescribed rules and regulations of householder life. So if somebody thinks, \"Yes, householder life is meant for enjoyment\", without the word 'license' there, you can be sure that they are heading for a collision. Just like the person who doesn't know how to drive a car and gets behind the wheel, is heading for a collision. As soon as somebody enters into householder life thinking, \"Yes, this is for enjoyment.\" Collision. It's not the purpose for entering householder life. \nSo people need to be properly trained before entering householder life, just as a person is properly trained before driving a car. I remember going out on driver's education with the driver next to me with his own brake. I remember being shown how to park the car, how to stay in between the lines. All that has to come before the license. This duty is being given to you. So you better know how to drive before you teach others how to drive. You better resolve these issues you discussed this morning and know how to dutifully stay together and to not divorce. Then you can teach others, because you'll understand the meaning of householder life as a sacrifice.\nJust like this woman who earned her realizations because she sacrificed. She had no sense gratification, she sacrificed forty-five years of her life. And when she spoke she spoke with such a crystal realization. Krishna blessed her, because she earned those realizations. She was selfless and dutiful. In the same way the other story we gave from the scriptures. \nAnyways, my time is up. And I thought I would just follow up on this morning's theme, and I beg all of you to please try to take these few words to heart and be good teachers. Be good examples, so that you can actually teach others. I understand that there will always be some exceptional cases where it was just virtually impossible. But we won't even try to give you that excuse. If you want to teach others and you are married, you must be good examples. And if you are helping others, then when they are getting married, just as you are counseling them when you are helping them to get married, you should make sure that they know that if they have any difficulties in their married life, they have to come back to you again for counseling. Because if you keep this example that we spoke about, you'll have the potency to help them and to convince them to work through their difficulties. Don't divorce. Please. Is that OK? Hare Krishna.\n","nid":"951"},{
"title":"Transcription of \"Don't Miss This Chance!\", a Talk given in Minsk on November 5, 2009","ref":{"target_id":"904"},"attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Book Distribution","Marathon"],"date":"Fri, 2009-11-13 03:18","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a very slightly edited, almost word for word transcription of a talk which I gave in Minsk on November 5, 2009, about the Prabhupada Marathon:\nIt's my last night here so maybe I will speak some parting words, something that's connected to the previous night's discussion.\nLast night our class was a little philosophical. Maybe it was difficult to follow. Sometimes I have a tendency to get caught up in my own thoughts about different philosophical aspects of the Supreme Lord.\nSo I'm not going to speak a lot of philosophy tonight. I decided to talk about some practical things connected to our discussion the night before last. Especially considering the time of the year that it is, I thought that I could speak a little bit on the subject of Prabhupada's books, the Prabhupada Marathon, and pleasing Srila Prabhupada. They are all connected to the topic that we were speaking about the other night specifically about the marathon the devotee's did in publishing seventeen volumes of books in two months. It's also connected to Prabhupada's statement that, \"Impossible is a word in the fool's dictionary.\" It's also connected to doing something as a collective sacrifice for pleasing Srila Prabhupada, putting more efforts than we normally put in our day-to-day activities, and being inspired by the idea of doing more.\nOf course \"doing more\" doesn't always necessarily mean that we are physically active. We also can do more by understanding or connecting our activities to pleasing Krsna. We can chant more, we can remember Krsna more, we can pray more. There are many things that one can increase that will be pleasing to Srila Prabhupada and ultimately will be pleasing to Krsna. It's not necessarily a fact that just by doing more physically that we will be able to obtain the result of all of these efforts together. But I do have to admit that during Prabhupada's manifest presence in this world, anyone who was here during that time, will remember that Prabhupada was pushing us to really do more physically and to remember also the goal of all of our activities.\nI spoke about that a little bit the day before about how I and so many other devotees around the world felt pushed by Prabhupada, especially in 1975, when he really started accelerating his emphasis on the publication and distribution of his books. And I also personally experienced the total physical exhaustion. But there was a certain sweetness, a certain pleasure, a certain taste that was incomparable to any other experience. And that I could lie down at night and offer my obeisances to Prabhupada and feel as if \"Whew, I really worked hard for Prabhupada today. And I've got another opportunity tomorrow to work just as hard. And another opportunity the day after.\" And it seems that Prabhupada was giving us opportunities to really think about how to work hard to do something that would produce a result that would be pleasing to him.\nI remember the devotees who were with me in our van, that we were traveling in during the time when Prabhupada made that quote, \"The devotees who travel in vans and distribute my books will get my extra special mercy.\" We would all at night, we'd offer our obeisances before taking rest. There was one devotee traveling with me. I remember, I would wake up in the middle of the night and look over and he was still on his knees with his hands on the floor, offering his obeisances three or four hours later. He would just fall asleep in that position and never made it into his sleeping bag. It was cold. It was in the middle of the winter and we were sleeping in the van. But he was just so exhausted that he would just never finish his obeisances. And it would happen many nights. I would wake up, open my eyes, and he was still there. I didn't want to disturb him because he was sound asleep. Why wake him up and tell him \"You're not sleeping properly.\" And the alarm would go off in the morning and he would still be there in that position. \nDuring those days we were always trying to decrease our sleep. We were trying to sleep less and spend more time out distributing books. And everything was simply completely optimized for spending as much as time as possible distributing Srila Prabhupada's books. And there was a definitely a certain sweetness in that, and a conviction that Prabhupada was pleased by the increased effort to do something for him. And I can say that, and I've told devotees this. I can honestly say, that knowing that experience now, when I look back at the years that I did that, I can honestly say that if I was never given that opportunity, I would have felt cheated in Krsna consciousness. I'm not specifically speaking about distributing books in this particular reference. I'm talking about the opportunity to push and push and push the body to it's limit and beyond, like the devotees did when they performed that marathon to publish seventeen books in two months. Many of them testified about the sweetness they experienced from being pushed in that way.\nBut the force was not that Prabhupada was standing there and just beating us, \"Do it, do it, do it!\" The force was Prabhupada's purity of purpose and his sincere desire to engage all of his disciples in Krsna's service\u2014his total selflessness in pushing us not for himself but to please his spiritual master and to please Krsna. Yes Prabhupada was pushing but his pushing was simply by expressing what his desire was. It doesn't seem like that was very heavy pushing. But he would just openly express what his desire was. And because everybody was completely tuned in to Prabhupada's desire.\nIt's just like you are trying to get a signal on the radio and you find that you get a clear signal, or these days, you're trying to get out with your mobile phone and to get a signal outside. Sometimes you have to go out of the building so that you can get a strong signal so that you can hear the other person on the other end. You go to wherever the signal is strongest and you say, \"Yes, I can hear you clearly now.\" So everything is clear and the message is clear, whatever is coming over the mobile phone is clear and enters the ears. \nSo everyone was tuned into Prabhupada's desire and the message was clear, it entered the ear, but it didn't stop there. Once it went into the ear, it went into the heart, and then there was sort of like an explosion, a complete outburst of wanting to do what was pleasing to Prabhupada.\nOf course, spiritual life, ultimately we want to get to that platform where it's continuous, Ahaituky apratihata, sa vai pumsam paro dharmo, yato bhaktir adhoksaje/ ahaituky apratihat, yayatma suprasidati\u2026 it's described that this type of service to the Supreme Lord, which is free from motivation and is uninterrupted is the only way for the self to feel fully satisfied. Ultimately we want to get to that platform and be completely unmotivated and with no interruption\u2014continuous non-stop devotional service. Because it's that type of devotional service which pleases the Lord and captures the Lord's attention. It pleases the pure devotee and the previous acaryas. And then ultimately one feels self-satisfied as well.\nWhen I talk about that word \"sweetness\" that's what I'm talking about\u2014 that taste of, \"yes\" that satisfaction from doing something that's really pleasing to Srila Prabhupada. And getting that confirmation in the heart. Nothing sweeter than getting that confirmation in the heart. When there's no doubts in your mind, \"I'm doing what my spiritual master wants me to do.\" It's a very, very sweet, sweet, sweet taste, incomparable to any taste that one can possibly get from anything in this material world. And Prabhupada was giving everybody the opportunity to taste that sweetness. That was his greatness. That he was pushing everybody by just expressing his desires.\nOf course, he would also get angry. Sometimes he would chastise. Sometimes he would encourage and pat the devotees on the head. You can hear so many different stories from Prabhupada's disciples how just a moment's association just catapulted them to the spiritual world.\nI had that experience just by Prabhupada looking into my eyes. When I went to one Bhagavatam class that Prabhupada was giving in Philadelphia and the temple room was completely full. So one of the devotees decided that he would close the door because there was just no room for everybody. And I was there, and I came a little bit late with another group of devotees because we were given a place to stay that was way far away from the temple and we couldn't get there exactly on time for Bhagavatam class. So we arrived in the hallway and the door was closed and we were trying to get into the door to get into class and somebody was standing by the door and was not letting anybody in. And Prabhupada said, \"Open the door!\" And the devotee had to immediately open the door and Prabhupada waved his hand, \"Come on in.\" He didn't care. He wanted to get everybody into the temple room. And I took the advantage to work my way right up towards the front so that I could get as close as possible to Prabhupada. And of course I was just staring at Prabhupada and Prabhupada's eyes met mine and then \"boom\". Just that moment, just that glance, just catapulted me into the spiritual world. But then I felt that Prabhupada saw everything, my whole history. I felt completely exposed by that glance. And then I had to look down and just shrink down to the floor and Prabhupada resumed class.\nMany devotees describe similar experiences. Just a slight exchange. A moment. \"Lava-matra\", one eleventh of a second. And Prabhupada would just transform their lives to catapult them to a completely different height of Krsna consciousness. Even by just a simple glance.\nSo all Prabhupada did to drive everybody to work so hard was to express his desire because for any sincere follower of Prabhupada, Prabhupada's desire was nondifferent from Krsna's desire and so therefore it's an opportunity to please Prabhupada and to please Krsna at the same time. It was the perfection of life. Samsiddhir hari-tosanam, that the highest perfection one can achieve according to his particular duty in life is to please the Supreme Lord Hari. It is the complete perfection of our existence is to get that opportunity to do something that pleases Krsna's pure devotee.\nSo Prabhupada, as we said, Prabhupada drove the devotees during that particular time to really place the emphasis on the distribution of his books. And anybody who has read Prabhupada Lilamrita, they heard how the Prabhupada Marathon started. It was all spontaneous. It wasn't that Prabhupada said, \"I want you to start a marathon in December for me.\" He just wanted us to distribute his books and to distribute as many as possible, and in as many languages as possible, all over the world. And so it was during that year, it was either '72 or '73, but all the devotees simultaneously just decided that during that specific time of the year when many, many people are out in the streets, \"Why don't we stay out later? People are out there and they need Prabhupada's books. So why don't we just stay out later because the people are there?\" And devotees just started to think this way. And that's how the Prabhupada Marathon started. We just all kind of\u2026 Prabhupada never expressed it, but devotees just started doing it, and all of a sudden before we knew it everybody was spending the whole month of December, spending more time out distributing Prabhupada's books. And because it was so sweet, everybody started to think, \"Why don't we do this every year?\" Of course Prabhupada liked that. He liked very much that devotees were always thinking of ways to distribute his books. He said, \"Tax your brains how to distribute these books.\" And so the devotees would always think of different ways of how to distribute the books.\nHow many devotees here have actually really taken part of a Prabhupada Marathon? Really taken part. Please raise your hands. Raise your hand high. Uh-huh. OK. So you know what I'm talking about. It's not necessarily that everyone goes out and distributes books, but it's a real collective effort. \nThe most amazing marathon that I ever participated in was in 1977 because just a few weeks prior to that marathon is when Prabhupada left this world. And anybody who was present during that when Prabhupada departed, anyways, it's indescribable what happened in everybody's hearts. You can ask any disciple of Srila Prabhupada, \"Where were you at the moment when you found out that Prabhupada departed this world?\" I guarantee there will not be one devotee who cannot answer that question. Everybody knows exactly where they were when they found out that Prabhupada left this world.\nI remember the exact place, I remember which phone I was using. I was using a payphone. And I was simply calling because I was in charge of a very large group of devotees who weren't initiated yet. And it was my specific responsibility in November, 1977, that I was supposed to train up all the younger devotees, uninitiated devotees, in distributing Srila Prabhupada's books. And I was in one vehicle and all the other devotees were in other vehicles and all of us were going to another temple. So I called the temple to tell the President of the temple that we were going to be late because we left late. So I stopped at this phone booth at the gas station to tell them that we were going to be late. And then it was at that moment that the devotee told me that Prabhupada left and it was during that time many of us were thinking that Prabhupada told us he was going to stay. At one point during that time Prabhupada did that, when the devotees said, \"Prabhupada if it's your decision, if Krsna has given you the decision to stay or leave, then you can make the decision if you want to stay.\" \nAll the devotees who were in the room at that time had a discussion outside, because there was a big discussion, \"Are we being selfish forcing Prabhupada to stay?\" Because Prabhupada had indicated that at one point that maybe he should go. So all the senior leaders were thinking, \"Well if that's Prabhupada's desire, are we being selfish because we are forcing Prabhupada to stay because we want him to stay for us?\" Because Prabhupada would many times speak like that. He said, \"This body is simply a bag of bones. It has to leave some time anyway.\" And he would say, \"Just like what I'm going through now, everybody is going to have to go through this.\" So Prabhupada was obviously he was\u2026 and anything Prabhupada said, as I explained to you the other night, as soon as he would say something it would go all over the world. So all the senior leaders who were standing outside Prabhupada's room were discussing amongst themselves, \"Should we ask Prabhupada to stay or should we let him do whatever he wants to do?\" So finally they got up the strength and the courage and conviction that, \"If Prabhupada has given us the indication that Krsna will let him do whatever he wants, then why don't we ask him to stay?\"\nSo one devotee was chosen as the spokesperson. He would speak on behalf of everybody else and they all came behind him and they pushed him up to Prabhupada's bed. Everybody was standing behind him with their hands on his shoulders. And they were encouraging him, \"Go ahead, say it, say it.\" And as he was speaking he broke down and started crying and crying and crying. And the devotees were saying, \"Go ahead say it, say it! And finally he said to Prabhupada, \"You have told us that Krsna has given you the choice so we decided that if Krsna has given you the choice then you should stay! You have to finish the Bhagavatam. We are not ready yet for you to leave.\" So Prabhupada looked at the devotees and said, \"You want me to stay?\" And all the devotees had tears in their eyes, and they said, \"Yes Prabhupada, we want you to stay.\" Then Prabhupada said, \"OK, I will stay.\"\nSo as soon as Prabhupada said that, everywhere throughout the world was thinking, \"Prabhupada said that he's going to stay. Krsna's given him the choice and he said that he's going to stay.\" In everybody's mind, that was it, it was a fait accompli, it was, \"Prabhupada's going to stay.\" And at least for me it was I was just going about my affairs and was convinced, \"Prabhupada's going to stay.\" And that's how so many devotees around the world were thinking.\nSo you can imagine what happened to me when I made that phone call. And the devotee on the other end said that, \"Niranjana, Prabhupada left.\" And I can't think those thoughts. What happened to me just, I never cried like that. And here I was with all those devotees, maybe fifteen or twenty of them and none of them were initiated yet. And I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to tell them. All I could do was cry. And we all had to figure out, the whole movement had to figure out, \"Where to go from here?\" We lost our father, we've lost our master, we've lost our Lord.\" And it was so difficult. And the only thing we had to hold on to was Prabhupada's desire. All we knew was that Prabhupada wanted his books distributed. Everybody in the whole society knew that if we wanted to please Prabhupada we had to distribute his books. And that was just a couple of weeks before the month of December, the Prabhupada Marathon. And it was the biggest marathon ever. And the devotees knew nothing else. \"This is it. Prabhupada wanted us to serve him in separation. Krsna decided that he would go. He decided to leave and now all we have is his instructions. What was that most prominent desire that he had expressed to everybody before he had departed from this world?\nSo you can imagine how everyone felt at that time that we have to bring Prabhupada back again, his presence, by distributing his books, because that's what he spoke about so much! And he always told us is that's what was pleasing to him. And if we wanted to feel connected with Prabhupada, we had to do the same thing that he asked us to do during his physical presence. And so we organized the biggest book distribution ever in the history of ISKCON. Devotees everywhere, they were going out and spending hours and hours and hours, exhausting themselves to distribute Prabhupada's books. And feeling so much solace in their hearts. \"This is our connection with Prabhupada. Doing what he wants us to do. \"That's our connection.\"\nAnd then the tradition continued. And it became a very special time of year. It used to be called the Christmas Marathon. We used the word \"Christmas\" because in America Christmas is December 25th. So for many years we called it Christmas Marathon, but afterwards we decided, \"Why should we call it Christmas Marathon?\" It's for Prabhupada.\" So everybody just agreed all over the movement, \"Let's change it to Prabhupada Marathon.\" And the tradition continued. And it went on for many years.\nOf course it still goes on in many places. And it should continue to go on because Prabhupada's desire is nondifferent now than it was then. He wants us to distribute his books. Of course, he wants us to study his books. He wants us to become the example that he speaks about in his books. Our whole lives are supposed to be connected to his books. They are not just for distribution. He wanted us to read them and to become the personalities that's talked about in his books. These books are nondifferent from Prabhupada. And we remember in those days when Prabhupada would get a new book, he would sit down, he would open them and he would start reading them. He would sit and read and read and read. And someone may think, \"Who reads their own books?\" But Prabhupada would look at every page and he would say, \"I have not written these books. Krsna has written these books. Therefore I read them with great enthusiasm.\" Prabhupada saw it that way, that actually he was simply an instrument, following the order of his spiritual master who gave him the order that, \"If you ever have money, print books.\"\nI was watching on the video, the same video I was talking about two days ago. There was a conversation between one devotee and Prabhupada. Prabhupada was sitting behind his desk in Los Angeles. And the devotee said to Prabhupada, \"Prabhupada, Gopal Krsna, [he wasn't a Maharaja then, he was a householder]. He said, \"Gopal Krsna is asking for a loan from the BBT to build buildings in Mayapura.\" And Prabhupada said, \"Oh how much does he want?\" The devotee said, \"Prabhupada, Gopal Krsna is asking for $160,000 from BBT.\" So Prabhupada asked, \"So do we have that money.\" He said \"Prabhupada, we have that money in the bank but if we send that money there won't be enough money for book publication.\" Prabhupada said, \"No!\" He said, \"No, you cannot do that.\" First thing is publish books. No loans, no temples, nothing. If there's not enough money to publish books then everything else is secondary. Books is first.\" And he said, \"That's the way it should be. Otherwise you cannot give that loan.\" So he said, \"Do you understand?\" And the devotee said, \"Yes Prabhupada I understand.\" He said, \"So, when you give this loan, how will he pay back?\" And he said, \"Well Prabhupada they have a plan that they are going to get the different temples to pay for different rooms in Mayapura and it will take about three or four or five years to get the money back from the temples by buying each room in the buildings and then they will give it back to the BBT.\" So Prabhupada said, \"So you will get the money back?\" And he said, \"Yes they said they will pay it back in three or four years.\" \"Only when it doesn't stop book publication you can give.\" And the devotee said, \"Yes Prabhupada.\" He said, \"OK, then you can do.\" That was his principle. Because he was told by his spiritual master that, \"If you ever get money, print books.\" Everything was centered around that. And the devotees knew, and it was at a time when the movement was expanding and everybody was going to the BBT for loans for building and purchasing temples. The movement was expanding and we wanted bigger temples and nobody had the money to buy bigger temples so they said, \"Let's get a loan and pay it back to the BBT.\" Prabhupada's principle was, \"Yes you can get money for building temples but first there must be sufficient money for printing books.\"\nSo, so much effort went into what Prabhupada's desire was. So even though Prabhupada left the planet, he left the clear evidence behind that his desire was to go on publishing his books and therefore it's something that we can never abandon as Prabhupadanugas. Not for thousands of years, we simply cannot abandon it. We have to continue to print books in as many languages as there are around the world and then distribute them all over the world. If we don't do that then we fail in fulfilling one of Prabhupada's most important desires.\nOf course, we know that Prabhupada gave many instructions and had many desires. And he gave different instructions to different devotees according to time, place, and circumstance. But the general instruction for everyone was the emphasis on the publication and distribution of his books.\nSo this is the time of the year where the opportunity for taking part in that sweetness is available for everyone. Anybody who wants to take part should be given all facility to take part. And I can tell from the core of my heart that if you've never taken part then you are really missing something. I hope that these few words that I've spoken will act as a form of encouragement to take part. At least once\u2014 you have to take part. I guarantee that if you make the sacrifice and you think of Prabhupada's pleasure, it will be sweet. Bittersweet. Because it's a big sacrifice. It's cold. So many other things you can do. So many more important things that you have to take care of. Urgent matters. You don't have time. And one excuse after the next can come and come and come. But you lose your chance. You get the chance to participate and if you lose that chance, you may not get it again.\nIt's like that when we get the opportunity to participate in the pastimes of the Lord. The Lord comes and you get a chance to part in His lila. His lila is going to go on anyways. You have a choice. You take part or not take part. But it's going to go on. So you have a choice. This book distribution is going to on whether you take part. There are devotees here who know the sweetness of the taste.\nSomebody is taking advantage of my talk right now I can see.\nThe devotees will go on and they will try to facilitate certainly as many devotees as possible to go out and to taste the sweetness.\nI have one godbrother. His name is Vaisesika Prabhu. I love this godbrother. He is such a magnificent soul. There is only one thing in his mind. Well, two things. Distributing Prabhupada's books and reading Prabhupada's books. That's all he thinks about. He's a householder. He has a wife, he has a business. But he spends very little time with both. All he thinks about is reading Prabhupada's books and distributing Prabhupada's books. And how to increase the enthusiasm of other devotees to go out and distribute books. And he organizes different marathons throughout the year for the whole congregation of devotees. It's a very small temple in Northern California. And I think one or two devotees live in it to take care of the Deities. But every marathon they have at least 240 devotees go out to distribute books. And they are all householders. He is giving them so much enthusiasm and inspiration to go out and distribute books. \nHe has a program called the \"Weekend Warriors.\" On the weekends then all the householders organize themselves and go out and distribute books in different ways. And he has a wonderful PowerPoint presentation for those who have computers on how to get absorbed in Sankirtan consciousness. Different ways that you can distribute books. Different things that you can say to people to distribute the books. Different things you can say in response to them when they say something negative. Everything is there. So that anybody can go out with a book in their hand and approach somebody and just simply try to please Prabhupada.\nActually I had this presentation translated into Russian. I'm going to post it on my website, if anybody wants to look at it. If anyone wants to take part in the marathon. I'm not promoting my website. If you want you can just simply go on the website to read this PowerPoint presentation and what I'll write about it. But I'm going to post it in English and Russian\u2014the PowerPoint presentation. I plan on getting it posted soon within the next couple of weeks. It will be there in Russian. And for those of you who have internet you can go to nrs.iskconboston.org. And then you will have some idea of what to do, and different ideas of how you can go out and distribute books.\nBut to do a marathon we need not only book distributors. We need devotees to drive cars, to drive out books, and cook prasadam. Just imagine having prasadam like you had the last three days. (devotees all express enthusiasm). Somebody packs that prasadam and brings it out to the devotees distributing books. That's how we used to do it. Year after year after year. Everyone was involved. Some of the congregation would come and do all the service in the temple and all the devotees in the temple would simply go out and distribute books. And some of the congregation would take some of their time off work to drive books out to the devotees at particular places. Some of the congregation would cook prasadam for the distributors and bring prasadam out to the devotees so that the devotees wouldn't have to come back to the temple for lunch. Sacisuta knows these things. Vrikodara knows these things. He's done it many years. He knows all the things that are required for organizing a massive marathon for Prabhupada's pleasure.\nSo you can either take part or don\u2019t take part. The choice is yours. But I can assure you that this is something that you don't want to miss, at least once in this lifetime. This life will pass by just as fast as that one opportunity. Don't lose that chance. Just don't lose that chant to really push yourself for Prabhupada's pleasure. Even if it brings tears to your eyes. Push. Push. Push. And think of Prabhupada's pleasure. And it will be so sweet. You'll just be thinking, \"What have I been missing? Why have I waited this long? I was so crazy. I'm just a miser. Why have I waited so long to take part?\" I guarantee that if you push and think of Prabhupada. Push and think of Prabhupada, you will think this way.\nI have the experience of crying. Sometimes it was so hard and so cold. I remember exactly. I was in a place called Greensburg, Pennsylvania. And with the winds it was about minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. And I was standing out in the parking lot with all, three sweaters, two coats, scarves, big mittens. And people were running out of the store, really fast, to get into their cars, and to turn the key to get the heat on. And I'm out there trying to stop them. And the only thing they can think of is to get in the car and to turn that heat on. And I'd have to somehow try to figure out how to stop them and to get them to look at a book? It was minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. I remember that it was so cold that I was crying, and my eyes would freeze shut. And I would take my hand out of mitten, put it on my eye to get my eye open. And then keep on going on. Of course, sometimes I would run inside the store and just warm up a little bit. And then I would run outside again. And many devotees did this. Just push. And just think of Prabhupada's pleasure. Even if it brings tears to the eyes. There's a sweetness there. And everybody should just get that chance. I'm just speaking from my heart having personally experienced it for so many years. Just to get that chance, even if it's only once, just to get that chance. Do you agree? Anybody disagree with me? Do you agree Damodara Dulal?\nSo it's coming up. It's November already. So as I was talking the other day that Prabhupada would sometimes push. I'm not pushing my desire on you. Please don't think that way. This is not my desire. I've presented it in such a way that I hope it was clear in everyone's ears and everyone's hearts that I'm just telling you what Prabhupada desires. I'm trying to reveal just a little glimpse of how Prabhupada drove us mad with the desire to please him. And that mercy is available to everybody. Not just Prabhupada's disciples. The mercy is available to all of you too. You're also Prabhupada's grand-disciples. You're also Prabhupada's servants. And you get that same nectar if you think of Prabhupada's pleasure. I promise you. Prabhupada is not miserly in distributing that nectar. He just gives it to anybody who just thinks of his pleasure in that way.\nSo tax your brain. Use the next few weeks to tax your brain and think, \"What can I do to take part?\" And if you can't do it this year, then do it next year. Approach your spiritual master and ask him what he thinks Prabhupada's desire is. There will be no dispute on this point. Nobody will disagree. Somebody may say something else when you first ask this question. But if you say, \"Did Prabhupada want us to distribute his books?\" You won't find anybody who will say, \"No. Prabhupada didn't want us to distribute his books.\" Nobody who was here during Prabhupada's presence would ever make such a statement. It was crystal clear. And everyone knew what Prabhupada wanted.\nSo if you can't do it this year, then do it next year. And if you can't remember what I've said tonight next year, and you're ready for it next year, then listen to this talk next year. Then do it next year. But don't let this life pass without taking part in a Prabhupada Marathon. I beg you. Don't let this life go by without taking part in a Prabhupada Marathon. Is that OK? Do you agree? Thank you. I'm sure Prabhupada will be very pleased. If you simply agree with that. Hare Krsna.\n","nid":"929"},{
"title":"In preparation for Govardhana Puja","ref":"","attachment":"","tags":["Transcriptions","Govardhana Puja"],"date":"Wed, 2009-10-14 11:13","author":"Niranjana Swami","comment_count":"0","body":"The following is a slightly edited transcript of the Sunday Lecture given in Budapest on October 11, 2009.\nSome devotees have asked if some lectures could be transcribed and posted sometimes, along with the audio file availability. So this is also in response to that request.\nHare Krsna.\n\nI've been asked to speak a little bit about Govardhana Puja. I am not going to speak for a long time. There will be more discussed about Govardhana Puja on the actual day of Govardhana Puja in New Vraja Dhama. And for those who are eager to hear more detail about Govardhana Puja you can attend the event there. In fact, before giving today's talk, I was given a mission, which was to encourage as many people as possible to participate in the Govardhana Puja celebration in New Vraja Dhama. And that's why I'm speaking from this section from Srimad Bhagavatam.\nSo my response to that was, \"Well for devotees, it doesn't require a long lecture. In Krsna Book it clearly states that anyone who neglects the performance of Govardhana Puja will never be happy. And all the snakes that reside on Govardhana Hill\u2014 there are many snakes that reside on Govardhana Hill\u2014they will certainly come and they will bite and will certainly kill those who neglect the worship of Govardhana Puja.\" Any questions? (everyone laughs)\nBut I should say a little bit more than that.\nThese are actually Krsna's words from the Bhagavatam. Well, not exactly. Krsna's words are given here in this chapter. Krsna's words were, \"This Govardhana Hill, assuming any form He wishes, will kill any residence of the forest who neglect him. Therefore let us pay our obeisances to Him for the safety of ourselves and our cows.\"\nThose are Krsna's words. Of course, here it says the \"residents of the forest\". So for the residents of Budapest, they will be able to avoid falling into that category, unless, of course you live in the forest.\nBut Krsna did make this statement because He did establish the Govardhana Puja celebration Himself. Of course, Krsna states in Bhagavad-gita\nyad yad acarati sresthas\ntat tad evetaro janah\nsa yat pramanam kurute\nlokas tad anuvartate\nWhatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues. (Bg 3.21)\nAnd Krsna also states that even He, Himself, performs prescribed duties because if He didn't and everyone followed His example the whole world would be put to ruination.\nSo there is also that evidence in the Bhagavad-gita where Krsna Himself establishes the importance for setting the standard for other people to follow. And for someone who has come to establish standards to follow, then certainly Krsna is the best person to establish them. Of course, some things that Krsna does we cannot do and we cannot imitate. And therefore sometimes people take this and distort it and will think that whatever Krsna does, we can do. Krsna enjoys in the forest in the dead of the night with married women. So let me imitate Krsna also and do as He did. But the Bhagavatam also states that we have to be very careful about imitating. We cannot imitate what great personalities do, but we should follow in their footsteps and especially we should follow their instructions.\nThe example is given that even the great controllers, the demigods, for instance like Lord Siva, He can drink a whole ocean of poison and hold it in His throat. And He performs this activity in order to protect people in general.\nAfter the poisonous ocean was churned, Lord Siva drank that ocean and held it in His throat. Another name for Lord Siva is Nilakantha, because He held this whole ocean in His throat. So we cannot imitate Lord Siva and drink a whole ocean of poison. We cannot even imitate by drinking even a drop of poison, what to speak of a whole ocean. Similarly we cannot imitate Krsna's activities and think that by so doing, by imitating them, that we ourselves are following their instructions.\nSo there is a big difference between imitation and following the instructions. But Krsna did establish the worship of Govardhana Hill and He actually established the festival of Govardhana Puja and He intended it to continue. There is a verse in this chapter, \"Worshiping Govardhana Hill\", Chapter 24 of the Srimad Bhagavatam, where this point is established in the commentary by Srila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur:\nsri-suka uvaca\nvaco nisamya nandasya\ntathanyesam vrajaukasam\nindraya manyum janayan\npitaram praha kesavah\n\"Sukadeva Goswami said, When Lord Kesava (Krsna) heard the statements of His father, Nanda and other senior residents of Vraja, He addressed His father as follows to arouse anger in Lord Indra.\"\nAnd in the commentary, Srila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains:\n\"Krsna's aim in provoking Krsna's anger was to break the mountain of his false pride. By lifting Govardhana Hill, Sri Krsna would thus initiate the blissful annual festival called Govardhana Puja. And He would further enjoy the pleasant pastime of dwelling for seven days beneath the hill with all His loving devotees. These are the successive reasons for Krsna's words.\"\nSo Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur is explaining here that Krsna's lifting of Govardhana Hill, His intention was to initiate this blissful annual festival called Govardhana Puja. Of course, lifting Govardhana Hill to protect His devotees is one of the events which has led to the observation of this festival. But as we also know, Lord Krsna Himself established the Annakuta, or the offering of a very large variety of foodstuffs for the worship of Govardhana Hill. Krsna Himself established that sacrifice and requested all the residents of Vrndavana Dhama to bring unlimited quantities of ghee and vegetables, and milk preparations, and sweets, and cakes, and sweet rice and to take all the ingredients which were normally used in sacrifice for worship of Lord Indra and to take those same ingredients and to use them instead to worship Govardhana Hill.\nSo this is another event which Krsna Himself organized, arranged Himself personally. He arranged for hundreds of brahmanas to provide so many different varieties of preparations to offer in sacrifice for the pleasure of Govardhana Hill. And then after the Annakuta ceremony was performed, then Krsna Himself assumed the form of Govardhana Hill. He assumed a very, very wonderful, magnificent form, residing on top of Govardhana Hill in that form, and while all the residents of Vrndavana were looking at Govardhana Hill when they were making this offering, Krsna was drawing their attention, saying, \"Just look and see how this hill has assumed a very wonderful, magnificent form and how He is accepting your offering.\" And at that time Krsna assumed the form of Govardhana Hill. And one could see on Govardhana Hill, Krsna's mouth and His arms reaching out to accept all the different offerings that were being prepared and offered to Him. And as we know when all the offerings were made to Krsna and Krsna was eating all the different things that were offered to Him, then Krsna said, \"Aniyora, Aniyora\". \"Give me more. Give me more.\"\nAnybody who does parikrama of Govardhana Hill as soon as they come by this Annakuta Ksetra, which is not far from our temple in Govardhana. This Annakuta Ksetra is the place where the Govardhana Puja sacrifice was performed by Krsna, and many years later by Madhavendra Puri. And as we know Madhavendra Puri also established a very large Annakuta, by offering mountains of prasadam for the pleasure of Govardhana. And also for the pleasure of Lord Gopal whose worship Madhavendra Puri had established on the top of Govardhana Hill. And actually anyone who goes on parikrama and when you come to the little town of Aniyora, and you go up the side roads and go around the back, you can see this place, this \"prakata sthali\", the place where Lord Gopal was discovered by Madhavendra Puri. Gopal prakata sthali. It's a little bit off the Govardhana Parikrama marga. You have to go out of your way. And in fact, it is surprising that it's a place that is not very commonly visited. Oftentimes when I go there when I am doing parikrama myself, it is locked up and nobody is there. You have to go and find somebody to open up the gate so that you can go in. But it is called Gopal Prakata Sthali. It is the place where Madhavendra Puri discovered the Gopal Deity. And that is in the village of Aniyora. And as we know that village is called Aniyora because it is the place where Krsna requested the residents of Vrndavana to \"Give Me more, give Me more, give Me more\", because He was not satisfied with the quantity of foodstuffs that were prepared for Him.\nOf course Krsna is satisfied even with a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water when it is offered with love and devotion. It is not necessary to offer unlimited quantities of foodstuffs to satisfy the Lord. And one can satisfy the Lord even with a very small, simple offering. And the Lord will be very eager to accept it. So there are so many examples in scripture of how the Lord was so pleased by even the most insignificant offering. And He was very much inclined to accept that offering because of the love of the person who was making the offering.\nSanatana Goswami would offer chapatis to his deity of Krsna and he couldn't even prepare them properly. He would just offer the dry chapatis and the Lord would accept. Or we know the example of Sudama brahmana. When Sudama offered the few grains of broken rice and the Lord was so eager to accept it from his hands.\nSo to satisfy the Lord does not necessarily require that we make huge unlimited variety and mountains of preparations to satisfy Him.\nBut on this particular event of Govardhana Puja the Lord established that there should be very, very large quantities of food prepared and distributed to everyone. Not only to the brahmanas, to the residents of the Dhama, and to all the local people, but even to the animals. So therefore Krsna wanted to establish that on Govardhana Puja a very large supply of prasadam would be prepared and offered for His pleasure. And Krsna Himself arranged for hundreds of brahmanas to prepare different offerings for the worship of Govardhana Puja. Similarly we can also serve and satisfy the Lord by making hundreds of preparations to be offered for the pleasure of the Lord on that day.\nWe understand that the principle is in pleasing the Lord. That is the perfection of any service that is rendered is that the Lord is satisfied by one's activities. If one does not have the facility or is physically incapable of doing something very great, the Lord will accept even something very small.\nJust like the example again of Sanatana Goswami. Sanatana Goswami used to circumambulate Govardhana Hill. That was part of his daily worship. And he would not take the parikrama marga that we normally take that is about twenty-two kilometers. When Sanatana Goswami was doing Govardhana parikrama, he would take the long way around, which was about forty kilometers. And he would do that every single day as part of his daily worship of Giriraja. And he was getting so old and it was becoming very difficult for him to do it. But still he would do it. Until one day a young boy came to Sanatana Goswami and told him. \"You are getting very old now. Why are you doing this long parikrama every day? This is too difficult for somebody of your age to walk such a long distance every day to worship Govardhana Hill.\" Still Sanatana Goswami was very inclined to continue but this boy was resistant and said, \"No you should not do it.\" So the boy went to Govardhana Hill and He took a stone from the hill and on the stone was the impression of Krsna's lotus feet. He brought it back to Sanatana Goswami and He said, \"Here you should take this stone and instead of circumambulating Govardhana Hill like you are doing every day, forty kilometers, simply circumambulate this stone and it will be as good as circumambulating Govardhana Hill. And Sanatana Goswami later realized that after the boy left that that young boy was none other than Krsna Himself, who had personally come to Sanatana Goswami to request him to minimize the strenuous parikrama he was doing every day and to just circumambulate this stone instead.\nSo from that day on Sanatana Goswami would simply circumambulate the stone and it was as good as doing his forty kilometer parikrama that he did. This is an example of how the Lord is very much inclined to accept the offering of the worshipper according to his capacity and his ability to do so.\nKrsna is known as bhava-grahi janardana. Bhava-grahi janardana means that he accepts the essence of the devotee's attitude in his offering. And there is a verse which is quoted in Caitanya Bhagavat, that a fool may say \"om visnaya namah\" and a learned brahmana may say \"om visnave namah.\" Two different expressions. [\"om visnaya namah\" is gramatically incorrect and \"om visnave namah\" is gramatically correct]. Anyways the point of the verse is that either way Krsna accepts the essence of a person's worship.\nThis verse was quoted by Lord Caitanya in answer to a question made by Isvara Puri. When Lord Caitanya was a young brahmana boy He used to come and hear Isvara Puri, who would recite from Krsna Lilamrita every day, the book that Isvara Puri had written. And Gadadhara Pandita used to sit and listen to Isvara Puri every day reciting from his Krsna Lilamrita. And young Nimai Pandita used to come sometimes and He would sit and listen to Isvara Puri reciting from his Krsna Lilamrita.\nSo one day, one day Isvara Puri said to Nimai, who was a great pandit at that time, \"Please can you tell me, find some fault with the Krsna Lilamrita that I have composed? Please point out some defect in what I have written.\" And Nimai Pandit, Lord Caitanya, said to Isvara Puri, \"Whoever finds fault with the words of a Vaisnava, he himself is the person at fault because whatever words a Vaisnava states are actual truths and must be accepted as absolute truths. And there is never any defect in the words spoken by Vaisnavas. So you are asking Me to find some defect in what you have written in Krsna Lilamrita. But actually if I find some defect then I am the person who has the defect. Because there are never defects in Vaisnava's words.\" And then Lord Caitanya quoted this verse how Krsna is bhava-grahi janardana, which means that the Lord accepts the essence of a devotee's attitude. He sees the intention. He sees that the purpose the devotee has in making some offering is to please the Lord. Even though he may make, by some external calculation, what may be called a mistake, the Lord does not see that as a mistake because He sees the essence of a devotee's service attitude.\nTherefore we understand how important it is to have an attitude of trying to please the Lord. Because that is what makes everything right. Even externally it may be right, faultless, no defect. But even if externally it appears to be perfect, if the intent is not to please the Lord then it is imperfect and it is an unacceptable offering. In fact the Lord is not even inclined to accept such offerings.\nThere are so many examples in sastra which illustrate this point, which establishes the principle that the Lord is not inclined to accept the offering of somebody who does not have the intention to please Him. There is a verse in the Bhagavatam:\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to those devotees who have no material possessions but who are satisfied to possess only devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Indeed the Lord relishes the activities of such devotees. Those who are proud of their prosperity, their aristocracy, or their high learning, they are generally puffed up by possessing such things and they will often deride devotees of the Lord. Even if such persons offer the Lord worship, the Lord will never accept it.\nSo this is one verse from the Srimad Bhagavatam, Fourth Canto, Narada Muni, which establishes the point that the Lord is not very much inclined to accept something from somebody who is very proud and especially those who are proud and who deride or make fun of a devotee because of a devotee's simplicity.\nSo there are many other examples which explains how the Lord is not inclined to accept an offering if it is offered with an improper attitude. So really, the essence is the intention or the desire to please the Lord. And that's why Krsna says:\npatram puspam phalam toyam\nyo me bhaktya prayacchati\nIf one offers me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water, I am inclined to accept it.\nBecause we know that it's not the leaf, the flower, the fruit or the water which is attractive to the Lord. It's the devotion which is attractive to the Lord. If a person has devotion within his heart then the Lord is very eager to accept whatever the devotee offers. So devotional service is not calculated according to quantity\u2014that only if there is large quantity will the Lord be pleased. We understand that it is the quality of the offering which pleases the Lord.\nBut on Govardhana Puja, (devotees laugh) Krsna wants a lot of prasadam. He wants it prepared and He wants it distributed. And if we want to please the Lord on Govardhana Puja, Who has set the prescedent Himself, we should do this. Not only did He arrange for the large quantities of preparations to be made personally. After all those arrangements were made then He assumed the form of the hill to accept them. And then after assuming the form of the hill to accept them, He said, \"Give me more! Give me more!\" \"Aniyora. Aniyora.\"\nJust like Lord Caitanya, He did the same thing during the Mahaprakasa lila, when Lord Caitanya, during the sata prahariya bhava, the ecstasy of twenty-one hours. When Lord Caitanya was standing up on the altar and He displayed His divinity. Because ordinarily Lord Caitanya, His mood was that of a devotee of the Lord. Lord Caitanya came how to establish how to teach devotional service by practicing it Himself. And therefore He is known as the channa-avatara, or the hidden incarnation. Because he did not appear as the Supreme Lord but He appeared as a devotee of the Lord. But sometimes during the nocturnal kirtans in the house of Srivasa Thakur, in His ecstasy He would do strange things to expose His divinity. But it would only happen momentarily. And He wouldn't display it for a long period of time. But during the sata-prahariya bhava. (The translator is having a hard time understanding the phrase.) Prahara is a unit of time. It is three hours. And sata means seven. Seven times three equals twenty-one. That's why it's called the ecstasy of twenty-one hours. Sata-prahariya bhava.\nSo during this sata-prahariya bhava, this ecstasy of twenty-one hours, Lord Caitanya stood up on the altar, took all the silas away, He set Them aside. He stood on the altar, and said, \"Now chant my abhiseka song and worship Me.\" And then He began to accept all kinds of offerings from the hands of the devotees. And the devotees during this Mahaprakasa lila, when the Lord revealed His divinity, He showed how He wanted more and more food to be offered to Him. So as soon as the devotees caught His mood, then they immediately went out into the villages and they began gathering huge quantities of foodstuffs. They would get yoghurt, curd, butter, Ganges water, fruits and vegetables, and all the devotees, they would buy everything that they could possibly find from the merchants, and the Lord would personally take from every devotee's hand and He would eat it. Whatever they brought, He would eat. And they could see that He had this insatiable desire to eat whatever the devotees would offer to Him. Then they went back out and they purchased more and more ingredients and they brought it back and they offered it to Lord Caitanya. Thus He was establishing His divinity. Who could eat such quantities of foodstuffs? Imagine going out and bringing everything and handing it to the Lord and everything was consumed? And that was only a small part of His ecstasy of twenty-one hours. That was the beginning. That was the appetizer. That was just to get everybody a little bit attracted to what was to come next. Because next then He would call one devotee, one after the other, before Him, and ask from them to ask for benedictions from Him. And He would reveal to every devotee who he was previously, and how the Lord actually appeared to Him previously and reciprocated with Him. And one by one, He brought the devotees before Him\u2014Advaita Acarya, Srivasa Thakur, Kholaveca Sridhar, Haridas Thakur, and for each and every devotee He would satisfy their desires from within the innermost core of their heart. \nAnd so this is how Lord Caitanya demonstrated the same principle, \"Give me more, give me more.\" And as soon as the devotees caught on to the Lord's mood they were so very eager to bring more and more and more to offer for the Lord's pleasure.\nSo this Krsna's mood on Govardhana Puja. And therefore He has established Himself, that this blissful festival should be performed annually, and that we should all observe it to satisfy Him by bringing quantities of foodstuffs that can be offered for His pleasure, by circumambulating the Hill which He, Himself, will assume, and by following in the footsteps of our previous acaryas by circumambulating Govardhana Hill.\nI've had the fortune to be in Govardhana on Govardhana Puja, and I can tell you, and anybody else who has been there on Govardhana Puja can also tell you, that there are no local villagers who neglect to observe Govardhana Puja. Hundreds of thousands of people go by, all day long, circumambulating Govardhana Hill. All day long. All night long. Very blissfully chanting in kirtan. Glorifying Giriraja, the King of all mountains.\nSo we have not talked very much about Govardhana Hill. We'll speak a little more about it on Govardhana Puja-- if you'll come. (everyone laughs). Hare Krsna.\nAny questions?\nNo? Then you will all be there. I can give my report. Mission Accomplished. (everyone laughs). Hare Krsna.\n\n","nid":"874"}
